<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;
</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   - relating the pattern of conductive features to the overall fracture
geometry;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - establishing the seismic properties of the rocks in relation to
other physical properties and to conductivity, in order to provide a basis for
interpretation of seismic results outwith the area of the RCF;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting direct measurements of rock stress to be made and
relating it to fracture apertures and flow;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be
undertaken for palaeohydrogeological investigations;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.

<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]
comments:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very
high quality.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual
Report</I> of June 1994 (para 3.10, page 11) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and

<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed

<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be

<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.

<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.

<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be

constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework

<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in

(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995

<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.

<P><B> Forward Programme

<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval

<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive

<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<TD>Detailed characterisation of two potential sites is planned to be carried
out in the period from 1994 to 2000. Subsequently, an underground laboratory is
planned for one site to provide sufficient geological data to allow an
application for a repository construction licence.

<TD>Comprehensive detailed surface-based characterisation began at Yucca
Mountain in Nevada in 1991 following its designation in 1987 by Federal statute
as the candidate repository site. Construction of an underground laboratory
commenced in 1993. It is planned that this will lead to a decision on an
application for a licence in 2001 and, if this is approved, repository
construction would start in 2004, 13 years after the commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;

<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   - relating the pattern of conductive features to the overall fracture
geometry;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - establishing the seismic properties of the rocks in relation to
other physical properties and to conductivity, in order to provide a basis for
interpretation of seismic results outwith the area of the RCF;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting direct measurements of rock stress to be made and
relating it to fracture apertures and flow;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be
undertaken for palaeohydrogeological investigations;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.

<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<TR>
<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be
undertaken commenced in 1986, some seven years after commencement of detailed
site investigation. If suitability of the site is confirmed, it is planned to
construct a repository which could be operational by 2008.

<TR>
<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<TD>Switzerland</TD>
<TD>Detailed characterisation of two potential sites is planned to be carried

<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.

</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the

impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.

<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.

<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the

in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual
Report</I> of June 1994 (para 3.10, page 11) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out. 
</P>
<P>3.6 As a context for their evidence remaining sections of this Proof of
Evidence present the following information:

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in

</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in

(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995

will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)

<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review

<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]
comments:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very
high quality.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual
Report</I> of June 1994 (para 3.10, page 11) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and

<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of

<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be

<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual

<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>

<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and

<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

Evidence present the following information:

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed

<TR>
<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be

<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs.

<P><B> Regulatory Framework

superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995

<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.

<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

Mountain in Nevada in 1991 following its designation in 1987 by Federal statute
as the candidate repository site. Construction of an underground laboratory
commenced in 1993. It is planned that this will lead to a decision on an
application for a licence in 2001 and, if this is approved, repository
construction would start in 2004, 13 years after the commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   - relating the pattern of conductive features to the overall fracture
geometry;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - establishing the seismic properties of the rocks in relation to
other physical properties and to conductivity, in order to provide a basis for
interpretation of seismic results outwith the area of the RCF;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting direct measurements of rock stress to be made and
relating it to fracture apertures and flow;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be
undertaken for palaeohydrogeological investigations;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland

<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining

<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TD WIDTH="480">Three potential sites are being investigated for a deep
repository. Detailed surface-based characterisation began in 1994 and, by way of
example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<TR>
<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be
undertaken commenced in 1986, some seven years after commencement of detailed
site investigation. If suitability of the site is confirmed, it is planned to
construct a repository which could be operational by 2008.

<TD>Spain</TD>
<TD>Choice of a site for detailed characterisation is planned for the year
2000. It is then planned that a 15 year programme, comprising surface-based
investigations followed by a rock characterisation facility, will be carried out
prior to decisions on repository construction.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<TR>
<TD>Switzerland</TD>
<TD>Detailed characterisation of two potential sites is planned to be carried
out in the period from 1994 to 2000. Subsequently, an underground laboratory is
planned for one site to provide sufficient geological data to allow an
application for a repository construction licence.

<TR>
<TD>USA</TD>
<TD>Comprehensive detailed surface-based characterisation began at Yucca
Mountain in Nevada in 1991 following its designation in 1987 by Federal statute
as the candidate repository site. Construction of an underground laboratory
commenced in 1993. It is planned that this will lead to a decision on an
application for a licence in 2001 and, if this is approved, repository
construction would start in 2004, 13 years after the commencement of detailed

<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>

<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and

<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">

<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts

at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><B>DR. ALAN JAMES HOOPER will say;</B></P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">

<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out. 
</P>

Evidence present the following information:

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   - relating the pattern of conductive features to the overall fracture
geometry;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - establishing the seismic properties of the rocks in relation to
other physical properties and to conductivity, in order to provide a basis for
interpretation of seismic results outwith the area of the RCF;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting direct measurements of rock stress to be made and
relating it to fracture apertures and flow;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be
undertaken for palaeohydrogeological investigations;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]:

<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research

<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to

The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<TR>
<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be
undertaken commenced in 1986, some seven years after commencement of detailed
site investigation. If suitability of the site is confirmed, it is planned to
construct a repository which could be operational by 2008.

<TR>
<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<TD>Switzerland</TD>
<TD>Detailed characterisation of two potential sites is planned to be carried

</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.

<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:

<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,

approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TD WIDTH="96">Belgium</TD>
<TD WIDTH="480">It is planned that a repository for high-level waste will be
located in the Boom clay and an underground laboratory in that formation at Mol&#173;Dessel
has been in operation since 1983. Detailed studies for a deep repository are
planned to commence in 2015 with repository construction around five years
later. 
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="96">Canada</TD>
<TD WIDTH="480">Detailed site characterisation at the lead candidate site (yet
to be chosen) is planned to take 12 years, followed by a stage of underground
investigations complemented by further surface investigations taking a further
seven years. A decision to apply for regulatory approval for repository
construction would follow that stage of underground investigation.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="96">Finland</TD>
<TD WIDTH="480">Detailed characterisation of three candidate sites commenced in
1993 following preliminary investigations at five sites. A decision to select
one site for a stage of underground investigations is planned for the year 2000,
eight years after the commencement of detailed site characterisation. An
underground laboratory is planned to operate over a seven year period between
2003 and 2010 leading to a decision on whether to apply for a construction
licence for the repository in 2010, 18 years after commencement of detailed site
characterisation.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="96">France</TD>
<TD WIDTH="480">Three potential sites are being investigated for a deep
repository. Detailed surface-based characterisation began in 1994 and, by way of
example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be
undertaken commenced in 1986, some seven years after commencement of detailed
site investigation. If suitability of the site is confirmed, it is planned to
construct a repository which could be operational by 2008.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Spain</TD>
<TD>Choice of a site for detailed characterisation is planned for the year
2000. It is then planned that a 15 year programme, comprising surface-based
investigations followed by a rock characterisation facility, will be carried out
prior to decisions on repository construction.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Switzerland</TD>
<TD>Detailed characterisation of two potential sites is planned to be carried
out in the period from 1994 to 2000. Subsequently, an underground laboratory is
planned for one site to provide sufficient geological data to allow an
application for a repository construction licence.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>USA</TD>
<TD>Comprehensive detailed surface-based characterisation began at Yucca
Mountain in Nevada in 1991 following its designation in 1987 by Federal statute
as the candidate repository site. Construction of an underground laboratory
commenced in 1993. It is planned that this will lead to a decision on an
application for a licence in 2001 and, if this is approved, repository
construction would start in 2004, 13 years after the commencement of detailed
site characterisation.
