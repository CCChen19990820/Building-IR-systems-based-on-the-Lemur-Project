<HR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<BR>
Community service is a powerful tool for youth development. It transforms
the young person from a passive recipient to an active provider, and in
so doing redefines the perception of youth in the community from a cause
of problems to a source of solutions. When combined with formal education,
service becomes a method of learning or &quot;service-learning.&quot; Service-learning
enables teachers to employ a variety of effective teaching strategies that
emphasize student-centered, interactive, experiential education. Service-learning
places curricular concepts in the context of real-life situations and empowers
students to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize these concepts through practical
problem-solving, often in service to the community.<BR>
<BR>
In setting forth standards of quality for school-based service-learning,
we do not presume to provide a list of absolutes, nor even a complete inventory
of the elements that contribute to high quality. Instead, what follows is
designed to serve as a yardstick that can be used to measure the success
of a variety of approaches to service-learning, locally as well as nationally.<BR>
<BR>
We are aware of the wide diversity among our schools, their students, and
their communities, and have tried to enunciate criteria broad enough to
be applied across varied regions and populations, yet concrete enough to
be translated into action.<BR>
<BR>
Service-learning connects young people to the community, placing them in
challenging situations where they associate with adults and accumulate experiences
that can strengthen traditional academic studies. Service-learning also
makes classroom study relevant, as young people connect their actions in
the world beyond the school's walls with work in math, social studies, language
arts, and science.<BR>
<BR>
Young people have few opportunities to be around adults outside of school
and home. As described in &quot;A Matter of Time,&quot; a report of the
Task Force on Youth Development and Community Programs of the Carnegie Corporation
(1992), too many children are raising each other with little stabilizing
input from adults.<BR>
<BR>
The isolation of young people has resulted in a rift between them and society's
institutions. Service-learning involves youth in active roles in the community,
and establishes a new relationship between young people and an adult facilitator;
hence it can be a powerful force in closing that rift.<BR>
<BR>
As they work together for a defined purpose, youth and adults will learn
to respect each other. When mutual trust is established between adults and
young people, meaningful dialogue, so often absent in the life of today's
youth, can take place.<BR>
<BR>
Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, service-learning
and community service are not synonymous. Community service may be, and
often is, a powerful experience for young people, but community service
becomes service-learning when there is a deliberate connection made between
service and learning opportunities which are then accompanied by conscious
and thoughtfully-designed occasions for reflecting on the service experience.<BR>
<BR>
Reflection may be described as the process of looking back on the implications
of actions taken --both good and bad--determining what has been gained,
lost, or achieved, and connecting these conclusions to future actions and
larger societal contexts.<BR>
<BR>
Effective service-learning responds to the needs of the community as well
as to the developmental and learning needs of youth. The model should be
modified to reflect the maturity and capacities of youth at different stages.
Duration of the service role, type of service, desired outcomes, and the
structure for reflection must all be designed to be age-appropriate. Service-learning
is most effective when it combines community needs and students' interests,
and is compatible with their skills and abilities.<BR>
<HR>
<H3>I. Effective service-learning efforts strengthen service and academic
learning.</H3>
<BR>
Service-learning efforts should begin with clearly articulated learning
goals, to be achieved through structured preparation and reflection--discussion,
writing, reading, observation and the service itself. Learning goals--knowledge,
skills, attitudes--must be compatible with the developmental level of the
young person.<BR>
<BR>
The examples that follow demonstrate that service can be linked to academics
in many ways, and at all levels. Even in the primary grades, when the youngest
children are learning about their own neighborhood, they can engage in conservation
or recycling projects. Children in elementary school might plan safe routes
for the walk to and from school to develop mathematics, observation and
map skills. In secondary school, adolescents can explore issues such as
hunger through virtually every academic discipline: crop rotation and rainfall
in science and geography, computing individual and collective nutritional
needs in math class, the economics of food distribution and efforts of governments
to address these problems in social studies, and so on. Service at a food
distribution center could reinforce all this learning by placing it in the
context of community needs.<BR>
<H3>II. Model service-learning provides concrete opportunities for youth
to learn new skills, to think critically, and to test new roles in an environment
which encourages risk-taking and rewards competence.</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
The experience of serving in the community, however laudable, is not an
end in itself. By performing meaningful work, young people can develop and
apply new skills, try on different roles, and plan--constantly reinforcing
connections between classroom learning and the real world.<BR>
<BR>
In making the world their laboratory, service-learning has the potential
to enable students to develop increased self-reliance in real settings.
They learn to work cooperatively, and to relate to peers and adults in new
and constructive ways. Their self-image improves in a legitimate way, not
because of imagined good feelings but rather as a result of increased competence.<BR>
<BR>
Students who work at a senior center learn about aging, the demographics
of a community, its available social services, government policy, history,
and human relations. Those who help supervise young children at a day care
center learn about child development, parenting, and social policy. School
students who develop a plan for school recycling and investigate local services
develop an understanding of the promise of recycling as well as the problems
it poses. In each circumstance, students learn to plan, to analyze problems,
and to test out new and challenging roles.<BR>
<H3>III. Preparation and reflection are essential elements in service- learning.</H3>
<BR>
Two essential elements that give service-learning its educational integrity
are preparation and reflection. Preparatory study of underlying problems,
history, and policies enriches student learning, as do deliberate discussion,
and other classroom activities. Preparation also should introduce the skills
and attitudes needed for the service to be effective.<BR>
<BR>
Reflection is the framework in which students process and synthesize the
information and ideas they have gained through their service experience
and in the classroom. Through the process of reflection, students analyze
concepts, evaluate experiences, and form opinions--all in the context of
the school curricula.<BR>
<BR>
Practicing reflection also assists young people to gain a greater sense
of themselves. For example, when learners are asked to think about their
own goals and progress in a service-learning experience, they have the opportunity
to master self-assessment skills which can help them to become more independent
learners. They acquire insights which allow them to build on their strengths
and to set goals in areas where they know they need further development.
Reflection also offers teachers an opportunity to identify the knowledge
students have gained through service. The methods used can assist students
with portfolio development or other assessment techniques.<BR>
<H3>IV. Students' efforts are recognized by their Peers and the community
they serve.</H3>
<BR>
In large and small ways during the period of service as well as with a culminating
event, students should share with the community and their peers what has
been gained and given through service. Recognizing the work that children
and youth perform reinforces the significance of the enterprise and the
worth of the young people.<BR>
<BR>
In a society that values work and measures people's importance by the jobs
that they do, young people, especially adolescents, are perceived as non-contributing
members of the society. Credit for their achievements, affirmation of the
skills they have mastered, and appreciation for the time they have devoted
to the community should be acknowledged publicly.<BR>
<BR>
This recognition can be done through the school, the school district, or
in the community. For example, local newspapers can publicize the work done
by youth, recognizing individual achievements while increasing awareness
of learning through service.<BR>
<BR>
Whether a culminating activity is a presentation about the service, a book
of essays, pictures, a party, a picnic, or an outing, there are many forms
that end-of-project recognition may take. Student creativity and energy
should be utilized in the planning and execution of the event.<BR>
<H3>V. Youth are involved in the planning.</H3>
<BR>
When young people are given the opportunity to work in after-school and
senior centers, tutoring young children, or leading an effort to clean up
a local stream, they are being entrusted with important work with the expectation
that they have the ability to perform it. Building that trust is essential
to the success of the effort. That is why it is critical to involve young
people at the very beginning of the work. Moreover it provides teachers
with important opportunities to encourage curiosity and to foster planning
and analytical skills.<BR>
<BR>
Instead of being told that they will be helping in the community, youth
might be asked to determine the needs of the community in which they live.
Even if it has been concluded that there are certain sites that are open
to receiving young people, the youth might be polled to find out how they
would like to participate. For example, if there is an interest among teachers
in environmental issues, the student body might be interviewed by a core
group of student information-gatherers to find out what concerns they have
and what ideas they have for addressing these concerns. Teachers and advisors
then serve as facilitators who make the tasks realistic and doable, but
the engine is driven by the youth, not by the adults.<BR>
<BR>
Just as it is necessary to build consensus and support for any group effort
in the adult world, it is also necessary to gain the support of young people
in reaching out to the community.
<H3><BR>
Vl. The service students perform contributes in a meaningful way to the
community. (In this context the school may be defined as the community.)</H3>
<BR>
The service roles or projects that involve students in service-learning
will differ widely, depending upon the age of the young people, the needs
of the community, and the specific learning goals that have been determined.
However, whatever the activity, the following features are shared by high
quality approaches:
<UL>
<LI>The work must be real; it must fill a recognized need, whether in the
school or in the outside community. 
<LI>The service activity must be developmentally appropriate. For example,
a district-wide K-12 effort to refurbish a park could consist of the following
projects: Younger primary students study plants, grow flowers from seeds,
and plant them in the park. Older primary students research what types of
birds live in the park's trees, and build bird houses or feeding stations
which they continue to maintain throughout the year. Intermediate-age students
extend the school's recycling program to the park--learning about and working
with city agencies to institute it, decorating collection bins, and designing
posters to increase community awareness. In health sciences, high school
students design and build an exercise path; in art class they create a mural
for park buildings; in social studies they survey the community to find
out what members would like the park to be used for and report their findings
to the appropriate government agency. A tangible or visible outcome or product
results from the service and when possible demonstrate, the learning outcomes.
</UL>
<H3>Vll. Effective service-learning integrates systematic formative and
summative evaluation.</H3>
<BR>
All learning programs, especially relatively new ones, can benefit from
systematic evaluation. While anecdotal evidence of a program's effectiveness
is useful, more systematic methods for assessing the impacts of service-learning
are needed, particularly since the field of service-learning is growing
rapidly and demand for in-depth understanding of program models and approaches
is high.<BR>
<BR>
Such assessment includes detailed documentation of program components and
processes; the outcomes identified by, and expected of, all participants
(i.e. students, community members, schools); and the impact of the service-learning
program on individual participants, schools, and community.<BR>
<BR>
Assessment processes can vary in extent and complexity, depending on the
nature of the questions asked and on available time and resources. For example,
if one question is, &quot;Do students' attitudes toward school change as
a result of involvement in service-learning?&quot; attitudinal measures
can be taken at various points, or indirect measures such as school attendance
can be u.sed<BR>
<BR>
A question like &quot;How does service-learning affect civic responsibility?&quot;
would require measures which assess components of civic responsibility such
as values, behaviors, and attitudes to be administered over an extended
period of time. If the question is, &quot;In what ways can the experiential
learning pedagogics associated with service-learning help to bring about
education reform?&quot;, then assessment methods need to focus on the relationship
between experiential teaching techniques and their multiple effects on learning
and development.<BR>
<BR>
A major benefit of formative (on-going) assessment is program improvement.
Ongoing data supplies necessary information regarding program design in
relation to program purpose and pinpoints where modifications might be necessary
or desirable.<BR>
<BR>
Summative assessment also affects program development, and in addition provides
aggregate information on the overall effectiveness of a particular program
model. A combination of formative and summative assessment, whether done
on a small or large scale, helps to ensure that programs remain responsive
to their purposes and participants.
<H3><BR>
Vlll. Service-learning connects school and its community in new and positive
ways.</H3>
<BR>
Service-learning has the potential to reduce the barriers that often separate
school and community. Students learn that they can move beyond their small
circle of peers and take their place as contributing members of the community
as they discover that learning occurs throughout the community in traditional
and non-traditional settings--libraries, public agencies, parks, hospitals,
etc. Relations are enhanced as agencies, citizens, and local government
officials find that their expertise and counsel is sought by the school.
Through service-learning, schools and communities become genuine partners
in the education and development of youth.<BR>
<BR>
Just as school administrators have an obligation to support the coordinated
implementation of service-learning in the community, the community must
be committed to supporting service-learning in the schools. Communities
must recognize and respect the curricular goals strengthened in the schools
by service-learning. Communities must work with the schools to ensure that
students' service opportunities are structured to be consistent with learner
outcomes.
<H3><BR>
IX. Service-learning is understood and supported as an integral element
in the life of a school and its community.</H3>
<BR>
In order for service-learning to be accepted and succeed in any setting,
it must receive institutional support for its philosophy and its financial
requirements. School-based service-learning needs the support of both district
and building administrators. Too often, educators enthusiastic about service-learning
are offered token support, largely in words of praise for the &quot;wonderful
work&quot; that is being accomplished.<BR>
<BR>
While spoken recognition is important, what is significant is the provision
of the time that goes into exemplary service-learning. Teachers who implement
service-learning, either as a discrete class, as a part of their subject
area lessons, or with thematic or inter-disciplinary learning, must be supported
with planning and implementation time as well as a reasonable budget for
student incentives, expenses such as transportation, and other outside resources
that can be crucial to the success of the effort.<BR>
<BR>
Outside the classroom, the development, implementation, and coordination
of service projects in the community require a level of support that must
extend beyond the efforts of any individual or group of teachers. Service-learning
can enhance school-community partnerships, but to do so, it must be presented
to the community in a manner that does not conflict with community interests.<BR>
<BR>
To ensure the stability of these school-community partnerships, schools/districts
implementing service-learning must provide continuing and visible oversight
as well as coordination among community interests and classroom teachers.<BR>
<BR>
Administrators should ensure that the climate of the school is open to service-learning.
Even those who are not directly involved in service-learning should understand
its significance.<BR>
<BR>
Teachers and students must understand why some students have different schedules
and may appear to be receiving special treatment as a result of doing service.
The whole school community must be aware of the learning and service goals
which enable students to pursue these goals.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, when there are placement sites, even those who do not have direct
contact with students must understand and welcome the young people. Students'
roles must be clearly articulated and their tasks carefully defined with
the awareness of the administration and clients of the agency so that the
work the youth perform is respected.<BR>
<BR>
The learning and service goals must be clearly defined and understood by
all involved.<BR>
<BR>
Parents play a critical role in the service-learning equation. At the minimum,
their permission must be obtained in order for the young people to serve.<BR>
<BR>
But they must be brought into the process at an early enough stage so that
they fully support the notion of service and the unique learning opportunities
that service provides.<BR>
<BR>
Communication of the benefits of service and its impact on attitude toward
school, and the relationship between work and service should be communicated
so that support from the home is forthcoming. Service also provides a wide
variety of options for parental involvement, as students learn about the
community of which their parents are adult members.<BR>
<BR>
Parents with busy schedules might offer ideas of resources or potential
placement sites, and when appropriate share with the students how their
work and volunteer experience affect the larger community.<BR>
<H3>X. Skilled adult guidance and supervision are essential to the success
of service-learning.</H3>
<BR>
The case for service-learning is compelling, but the task is a complicated
one to sustain. Teachers employing service-learning in their classrooms
should have opportunities for professional development. They must be given
the tools, the training, and the technical assistance necessary to implement
meaningful service-learning experiences.<BR>
<BR>
Issues of type of service, site selection, curriculum connections, reflection,
recognition, tangible outcomes, and evaluation must be considered along
with the ever-present concerns of insurance, liability, and logistics.<BR>
<BR>
Learning takes place during the preparation and while serving and reflecting.
Youth must be afforded supportive supervision at placement sites. Supervision
at the site should extend beyond the basic elements of taking attendance
and keeping track of hours worked.<BR>
<BR>
With such rich opportunities for youth to grow, to learn about others, and
to take on responsibility, a caring person must assume responsibility for
overseeing youth activities and supporting these efforts.<BR>
<H3>Xl. Pre-service training and staff development which include the philosophy
and methodology of service-learning best ensure that program quality and
continuity are maintained.</H3>
<BR>
If service-learning is to assume real importance in educating students for
the St. century, it must be incorporated into preservice and in-service
training and staff development. It will be critically important, especially
in this transitional period as service-learning begins to find a place in
the educational process, to provide high quality training.<BR>
<BR>
Many of the teaching strategies and behaviors essential to high quality
in school-based service-learning are in sharp contrast to what has been
taught in &quot;methods&quot; courses. It will not be enough to offer course
work at educational institutions; potential teachers should engage in service-learning
as part of their own training.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Grounded in Theory</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Since the early 1980s, many educational and political leaders have begun
to advocate that our young people become involved in their communities.
With this recommendation comes the hope that students will recognize how
to balance the rights of citizenship with the responsibilities of community
membership. The position which views education as the stage for accomplishing
this end is grounded in both common sense and in sound educational theory;
it goes all the way back to Aristotle. In our own century, John Dewey, and
more recently, Ralph Tyler and Hilda Taba have reminded us that students
who actually do things--who engage in activities related to school subjects--learn
more efficiently, more effectively, and remember what they have learned
much longer than students who don't.<BR>
For Dewey, it had to do with the fact that the mind is social not individual
and thus learning comes from social activities. For Tyler and Taba, the
point was simply that &quot;learning occurs through the active behavior
of the student. It is what [the student] learns, not what the teacher does.&quot;
(Tyler, 1949) These principles have been borne out by study after study,
and in the work of such widely respected and diverse educators as Jean Piaget,
James Coleman, and David Kolb, to name a few. <BR>
Service Learning (S-L) can provide a central focus around which educational
change can occur. Examples of Service Learning validate the research of
Goodlad and Oakes which holds that &quot;curriculum best suited to providing
all students with access to knowledge is organized around central concepts
of the disciplines and grounded in real-life experiences .&quot;(1988, p.
19) Moreover, S-L enhances the ideas promoted by various circles of school
reform. Theodore Sizer's nine principles and David Berliner's management
of teaching are a few of the philosophies that provide the sound theoretic
foundation for instituting Service Learning programs. As a school successfully
implements S-L, school reform become more than theory. S-L provides a focus,
a central theme around which school reform can occur and places the school
in the context of the community. <BR>
Kate McPherson (1989) writes that S-L becomes a unique expression of a school
and its community as it provides a powerful way to integrate current educational
reform recommendations with critical community concerns. Further, she suggests
S-L facilitates school reform while providing an expanded pedagogy to meet
the learning styles and needs of all students, making learning relevant
and exciting and necessitating critical thinking about what has been learned.
Serving as a catalyst for school reform, S-L invites new visions of school
restructuring. <BR>

After learning about the alphabet, children in a kindergarten class designed
and contributed a page to an alphabet coloring book. The class book was
presented to preschoolers in a Head Start daycare. 
<UL>
<LI>A first grade teacher had her students interview elderly members in
their community and then chronicle these histories in a book for the town
and school libraries. 
<LI>First and second graders learned about team work and service while reading
stories about quilts. As a result, students sponsored a quilting bee to
collect student/parent made quilts for babies with AIDS. A connection with
math was made as students measured and cut the material into accurate squares.
<LI>A second grade class built a supermarket in class. Using the project
to learn about math, the students also studied recycling issues. The class
designed a pamphlet to educate their families and community. 
<LI>Third and fourth graders learned about hunger and homelessness while
growing a vegetable garden in the backyard of an elderly center. Regular
visitations were made in which the students and a senior partner worked
on their plot. Part of the produce went to the senior partner, the other
to a homeless shelter. 
<LI>Fifth graders explored topics like animal habitats, soil, and recycling
natural resources in science class. To complement this learning, they spent
a class day creating a conservation area in a former ravine making trails,
planting shrubs and developing a sledding area. 
<LI>Beginning as the evolution of a CSL inclusion model, a fifth grade language
arts class worked with their school's developmental skills class and learned
about their partners physical and mental disabilities. Assisting the special
needs students with classroom assignments, they recorded their experience
in a log which was later used to create picture books about the partnership.
</UL>
<BR>
Each of the above examples demonstrates the power of Service-Learning as
a classroom strategy. S-L actively connects the classroom with the community,
providing opportunities for experiential learning. Elementary teachers find
that this methodology helps students recognize the usefulness of new knowledge
as they apply it in real settings while serving their communities. Moreover,
it promotes social and personal development, supporting the growth of the
whole child. With S-L: 
<UL>
<LI>&#183;subjects become less compartmentalized and more integrated; projects
may be related to a single subject or expanded into an interdisciplinary
unit. 
<LI>&#183;student learning is more active and meaningful. 
<LI>&#183;opportunities for developing comparative and critical thinking
skills increase. 
<LI>ample opportunity to develop basic skills of reading, writing and computation
exists. 
<LI>both cognitive and affective growth are strongly promoted. 
<LI>classroom learning gains relevancy as students process and reflect upon
new information 
<LI>while exploring the relation between school subjects and real life.
<LI>new concepts are related more readily to standard curriculum when teachers
refer to concrete examples familiar to students. 
<LI>assessment becomes more authentic and legitimate. 
<LI>community support of schools is strengthened and vital allies are recruited.

<I>&quot;<B>In the early evening darkness (&quot;Hurry up, Mom!&quot;) and
flashlight in hand, my son and I walked through Ravenna Park to the area
of the creek he and his class shared in 'adopting' to restore/preserve/protect.
The outward excitement, inner satisfaction and intimate relation was so
wonderfully evident as he spotlighted the perimeter of the fenced safety
net and each of the many individual plantings. We talked of how helpful
this project was in terms of the environment. Service-Learning integrated
into the hands-on science enables students to pursue a depth of richness
of experience unmatched!&quot; </B></I>-5th grade parent.<BR>

In a time when schools are often criticized for having limited relevance
and worth to students, the S-L teaching method awakens new visions of education.
By moving beyond the four walls of traditional education and using the community
as a classroom, teachers can provide meaningful and exciting settings for
productive learning while allowing children to engage in experiences that
respond to their development needs for concrete, hands-on learning. <BR>
Since the standard elementary curriculum already covers &quot;family&quot;
and &quot;community,&quot; the effort to include S-L takes just a little
imagination. While it is common for young students to visit community agencies
like fire stations and police headquarters, they are rarely asked to contribute
actively during these outreaches. Linking these visits with an identifiable
&quot;problem&quot; provides the students with the opportunity to reflect
critically and act strategically. For example, a class might investigate
fire safety by participating in an information-gathering trip to a local
station. Their findings may then be distributed to the school or outside
community. Their projects could involve educating other children about fire
safety, learning about the importance of smoke detectors and working to
ensure that all students' homes have one. While engaged in this project,
students would be using language arts skills like organizing information
and presenting it orally and in writing.<BR>
Unlike traditional community service, which is often relegated as an after
school activity, Service-Learning has become an accepted classroom methodology.
S-L helps students become early community &quot;citizens&quot; as they learn
how school subjects and skills relate to the world in which they live. In
the process, S-L is legitimized as a regular feature of the elementary classroom.
<BR>
S-L becomes part of the educational process in elementary school programs
when it is integrated into curriculum areas. This integration comes readily
since S-L is often a natural extension of the content and skills already
being developed in the classroom and does not distract rather enhances existing
curriculum. Teachers may either take an existing unit and identify where
Service Learning fits into it or they may pick a new theme and build service
and academics around it. In this way, by selecting a service theme and either
building it into an already established unit or building it around a new
unit, service-learning becomes unified with the learning process, instead
of an extra task for teachers to add to an already busy day. This approach
allows educational content objectives to be achieved through active learning
as well as traditional learning methods. 
<H3><CENTER>For the Benefit of All</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
At the 1992 National Service Learning Conference in Everett, Washington,
when asked by an adult in a breakout session, &quot;What did you learn from
this [intergenerational] project?&quot;, a kindergartner was able to verbalize,
&quot;I learned how to make a friend, and that is a good thing!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Overall, S-L lays the foundation for a lifetime ethic of applying habits
and skills learned to strengthen the community and improve and enrich the
lives of all. Incorporating this methodology into the elementary program
establishes a learning community in which both the givers and receivers
benefit. Service-Learning adds depth to the elementary program by, 
<UL>
<LI>exposing and involving students in the community which elicits excitement
and inspiration to learn how to communicate. 
<LI>giving students the chance to contribute actively to the community and
leading them to gain less tangible but equally essential skills like cooperation,
empathy and citizenship. 
<LI>offering the unequivocal benefit of boosting self-esteem as students
become empowered to make changes and improve their world. 
<LI>instilling in students an awareness, understanding, and appreciation
of community, the value of citizenship, and the responsibility each citizen
has to help others for the benefit of the community.

<LI>In Black Diamond, Washington students are literally unearthing their
history as they excavate a local &quot;ghost town&quot;. 
<LI>Students in Salt Lake City, Utah helped clean up a hazardous waste site,
passed two new laws and planted hundreds of trees in their commitment to
improve the environment. 
<LI>Students at Louis Armstrong Middle School (Queens, New York) are enrolled
in a variety of service-learning programs. Two classes work with young children,
one class works at a local daycare, and another is paired with a nearby
first-grade elementary school class. Reluctant readers are building new
relationships and are developing competence and leadership skills. 
<LI>As eighth-graders in San Antonio, Texas serve as teachers to elementary
school students, and their own reading levels have gone up and the drop-out
rate has reduced from 86% to 6%. 
<LI>These are just a few of the many ways service is enhancing learning
and making communities a better place to live. 
</UL>
<H3>Why Service-Learning Is Appropriate for Middle School Youth</H3>
Middle school youth are going through immense physical and emotional changes.
In its study New Roles for Early Adolescents, the National Commission on
Resources for Youth strongly recommends that schools develop programs which
enable students to:
<UL>
<LI>Test and discover new skills. 
<LI>Develop a sense of competence, an &quot;antidote to the self doubt of
this period&quot;. 
<LI>Socialize and try out different roles. 
<LI>Be exposed to a variety of role models, adults who represent different
backgrounds and occupations; 
<LI>Speak and be heard, so they can make a difference; 
<LI>Test their developing morality and value structure in authentic situations;
<LI>Have tangible or visible outcomes, either of a short-term nature or
divisible into clearly defined stages. 
<LI>Share in decision-making within appropriate parameters. 
</UL>
<BR>
Service-Learning can be a powerful way to implement these recommendations.
The following indicates <B>Needs for Early Adolescents</B> followed by <B>How
Service-Learning Responds</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEED:</B> Test and discover new skills.<BR>
<B>RESPONSE:</B> Provides projects where students' participation makes a
clear difference. <BR>
<B>EXAMPLES:</B> Writing a story for a child in the hospital; Teaching Spanish
to a nursing home resident.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEED:</B> Develop a sense of competence.<BR>
<B>RESPONSE:</B> Provides projects which enable students to use the skills
they are learning in community settings.<BR>
<B>EXAMPLES: </B>Using math problem-solving skills to plan a community garden;
reading a child's story dramatically.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEED: </B>Exploration of roles.<BR>
<B>RESPONSE:</B> Provides projects where students experience a variety of
roles. Service programs provide young people with meaningful work in which
they are expected to perform in the role of leader and giver.<BR>
<B>EXAMPLES: </B>Being a leader with younger children; organizing a community
event.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEED: </B>Shared decision-making.<BR>
<B>RESPONSE: </B>Provides projects where students cooperate with others
to realize a goal.<BR>
<B>EXAMPLES:</B> Organizing and promoting a recycling project; Making a
brochure and slide show about the neighborhood.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEED: </B>Active learning with tangible outcomes<BR>
<B>RESPONSE: </B>Provides a learning setting where students learn through
community-based experiences. <BR>
<B>EXAMPLES: </B>&#183; Learning about plant growth and biology as they
grow plants and restore stream banks; learning about the local history as
they establish a tribal history museum.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEED: </B>Develop moral and value strucuture<BR>
<B>RESPONSE: </B>Develops the ability to interact and work with people different
than themselves.<BR>
<B>EXAMPLES: </B>Developing relationships with senior citizens through partner
programs; seeing the commonalities among people as they work with homeless
children.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEED: </B>To be heard when speaking<BR>
<B>RESPONSE: </B>Prepares students to become <BR>
contributing citizens by teaching habits and skills of active citizenship
fostering an ethic of service.<BR>
<B>EXAMPLES:</B> Gaining an understanding of city decision-making as they
work on a task force to develop a teen center; developing an investment
in their communities as they work with neighbors to make their housing project
&quot;gang free&quot;.<BR>

<H3>Options for Infusing Service</H3>
Schools throughout the state are implementing service using one or several
of the following options:
<UL>
<LI>Community-Based Service 
<LI>Co-curricular Programs 
<LI>Service Clearinghouse at the School. 
<LI>Recognition for Community Involvement. 
<LI>Service Within the School 
<LI>Authentic Application of Classroom Learning 
<LI>A Community Service Class 
<LI>School-wide Integration into the Curriculum. 
<LI>Community-School Partnerships. 
</UL>
<BR>
These options are grouped on the continuum below from left to right, roughly
in order of their level of integration into the overall school curriculum.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Community-Based Organizations</B><BR>
A number of community-based organizations have a rich tradition of service,
such as YMCA's, Scouts, Campfire, 4H. Many school communities are beginning
to work more<BR>
collaboratively with these community-based organizations. These collaborations
may occur during or after school hours.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Co-Curricular Programs</B><BR>
Most schools currently incorporate service into clubs and after school activities.
These activities are strictly voluntary, and students receive neither academic
credit nor time off from school. Organizations such as Builders' Clubs plan
and implement a variety of service projects. Many schools are developing
their own service clubs and some are creatively involving parents.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Service Clearinghouse</B><BR>
Many schools help students connect with community service and leadership
opportunities by providing information about community agencies and their
service needs. For example, Alki Middle School (Vancouver) sponsors a Volunteer
Involvement Fair. Through this event students become aware of volunteer
opportunities available in the community. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Service Within the School</B><BR>
Students also make the school a better place for other students. They can
help other students feel a part of the community. Because they remember
all too well their feelings of anxiety and concern as they moved into the
school, students often can become good mentors to students facing similar
situations.<BR>
<BR>
Tutoring as an Instructional Technique. Tutoring benefits everyone involved.
Youngsters receiving tutoring not only gain extra individual attention and
practice, but also friendship of an older person and role model. Student-tutors
learn material better when they have to explain it to someone else, and
they gain self-confidence by knowing they have something to offer others.
Finally, teachers benefit when students help one another, especially in
schools that are struggling to meet the diverse needs of youth. Experience
has also taught that tutoring someone else can ignite a flame in an otherwise
unsuccessful child. <BR>
<BR>
A Stanford University study conducted in more than 500 schools suggests
that peer tutoring has a more cost-effective impact on student achievement
than smaller class sizes and computer-assisted instruction. 
<H3>Authentic Application of Classroom Learning</H3>
Because service can enliven classroom learning, middle school teachers throughout
the state are developing ways to apply the skills and information they are
learning to significant community needs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Teaching Others:</B> Some students provide a service as they teach others
what they are learning in their classroom.<BR>
&#183; Students who are learning Spanish tutor English-as-Second Language
students, providing a much needed service as well as strengthening their
own language skills.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Producing a Helpful Product:</B> Some classes encourage students to develop
products which are helpful to the school and community. Products could include
books, computer programs, games, videos, plays, or murals. <BR>
Middle School students in Issaquah Middle School grow native plants for
stream restoration. Students in Stocking, MI write stories which are donated
as a packet for new mothers to encourage them to read to their children.
Students have documented their local history in a book which has been reprinted
several times due to its popularity.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Addressing Significant Needs/Issues: </B>Still other programs encourage
students to address a significant issue. Students in science class might
collect and analyze data on local streams to determine the amount of pollutants.
In a social studies class students might develop specific strategies for
addressing prejudice in their own school.<BR>
<BR>
A sixth-grade social studies class at Kopachuck Middle School provides a
context for students to understand what it means to live in hungry, impoverished
societies. After studying a variety of African countries that are experiencing
famine, the students produced hunger notebooks which included information
from national newspapers, magazines, TV stories, and other current information
about the hunger issue. Following an Oxfam &quot;hunger banquet&quot;, students
collaborated with the Red Cross to help them in their quest to make a difference
with penny bottles. Money was raised for hunger relief around the world,
and Friendship Boxes were created for children in Somalia.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Examples of Service-Learning Within Various Curriculum Areas<BR>
Math: </B>In Philadelphia's OASIS program students learn math, science and
basic skills as they have helped to construct community beautification projects.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Social Studies:</B> Middle school students in Teens, Crime, and the Community
at Morningside Middle School have built a greenhouse, hired a horticulturist,
and are landscaping around buildings, and along a number of comunity sites.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Language Arts: </B>Eighth-grade youth at M.S. 115 in Bronx, N.Y. practice
writing/reading skills in this cross-aged tutoring program with elementary-aged
E.S.L. and Special Education students.<BR>
<BR>
<B>PE/Sports:</B> Student designed and implement a sensory obstacle course
for P. E. class for blind students. After introducing students to what it's
like to be physically challenged, they design games that would be appropriate
for disabled children and adults. 
<H3>School-wide Integration of Service into the Curriculum</H3>
Some schools insure that service is a central part of the curriculum by
teaching at various levels. Damascus Middle School incorporates Lion's Quest
Skills for Adolescents, Skills for Growing into the district's drug and
alcohol prevention program. Students gain experience in community building,
communication, interviewing, decision-making, building self-confidence,
listening, validating others, taking responsibility and cooperation. Each
grade-level has different service focus -- environment, senior citizens,
and homelessness and hunger --around which they apply the Quest Skills.
<H3>Integrated Curriculum</H3>
Service can be a powerful way to integrate content areas for community issues
rarely honor curriculum boundaries. As students address issues like homelessness
they need to use math, science, language arts and social studies skills.
The following curriculum maps demonstrate how service can naturally link
content areas: 
<H3>Elements of Effective Programs</H3>
<B>Preparation:</B> Be sure to prepare students so they can effectively
serve. Have students role-play situations they're likely to face Many community
agencies have activity or volunteer coordinators who are able to provide
orientation sessions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Meaningful roles for youth:</B> Middle school students who are ready
to take on significant projects need mentors and assistance for they can
easily fall victim to communities and adults who don't take them seriously.
Middle school youth--more than the cute children of elementary school or
more than the competent high school students-- need an adult who can help
advocate for them with community members to expand their leadership and
service opportunities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Reflection:</B> A critical component of all service learning is the opportunity
to examine events and to distill important lessons. These activities ensure
that students maximize the learning potential of service experiences. Have
students explain projects they've done and why they were interesting and
fun. The resource books listed at the end of this packet provide practical
examples of reflection activities. 
<H3>Effective Elements In Action</H3>
<B>Preparation</B><BR>
1. Identify Curriculum Focus.<BR>
&#183; Write together as a class- refer back to this often. <BR>
&quot;Why are we doing this?&quot; &quot;What curriculum objectives do we
want to learn through this project?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
2. Identify and analyze problems.<BR>
&#183; Collect newspaper articles- post on bulletin board<BR>
&#183; Interview - Community leaders, teachers, parents, etc.<BR>
&#183; Survey- Service agencies/ organizations, students, etc.<BR>

<B>Reflection</B><BR>
Reflection throughout a project motivates students to think about their
decisions and actions as they serve. Sample reflective questions:<BR>
1. &quot;Is our project going the way we want?&quot;<BR>
2. &quot;Have our feelings (about issues) changed?&quot;<BR>
3. &quot;What difference does my service make?&quot;<BR>
4. &quot;How did I apply my classroom learning to my service project?&quot;<BR>
5. &quot;What else can we do to help?&quot; 
<H3>Tips from the Field</H3>
<B>Curricular Links </B><BR>
Help students see the connection between the service experience and the
core content of your courses. Students and teachers might discuss the primary
goals of the course and explore ways that community projects might teach
or demonstrate the core skills and concepts of the curriculum.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Provide Safe and Successful Experiences</B><BR>
Consider safety and supervision requirements to insure student success at
service <BR>
sites, especially when they're with younger children or frail adults. While
you can never insure that accidents won't happen, it's best for everyone's
safety that details be thought through extensively. Work with the school
principal and community site coordinators to determine if you adequately
meet all liability requirements. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Remember the Details </B><BR>
Middle school students need support in remembering details, especially equipment,
time of arrival, and arrangements for transportation. Even when students
do a lot of the organizing, they may need a checklist or a &quot;Plan of
Action&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Encourage Participation </B><BR>
Encourage more active participation. You may sub-divide the class into a
variety of projects so that every student is actively involved and has peer
support. Students could be responsible for the components, such as: Study,
Action Research, Celebration, Public Relations, Recognition, Fundraising,
Community Outreach, Team Management, and Permission Forms.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Build on Special Interests</B><BR>
While any number of service projects can be powerful experiences for pre-adolescents,
young people at this age have a strong interest in working with projects
which have a visible results:<BR>
&#183; Environmental projects.<BR>
&#183; Projects in which they work with younger kids.<BR>
&#183; Media or mural work which beautify the community, building playgrounds
or equipment for special needs children.<BR>
&#183; Work with disabled children, especially if it entails physical activities
like sports.<BR>
<BR>
While projects with senior citizens can be very valuable, those programs
need tending and need to be done long-term to insure that relationships
can develop beyond their stereotypes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Inclusive Groups </B><BR>
Young people like to have the opportunity to work with their friends or
other people from their school. While some can clearly work alone on a voluntary
basis, most feel more comfortable if they have friends of a similar age
with them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Recognition </B><BR>
Recognizing the efforts and results of the young people helps them realize
that what they are doing is important. Several communities are doing service
fairs which provide opportunities for students to speak about what they've
learned and accomplished. Celebration may include newspaper articles, displays
in a bulletin board, articles in your school newsletter and slide show etc.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Clarify Commitment/Time Constraints</B><BR>
Should students come upon a project which is exciting to them and which
demands additional time, you need to determine your willingness to provide
needed support and leadership. If you can't, find someone else sho can help
for &quot;serendipitous&quot; experiences are often the most powerful for
pre-adolescents who need to test their limits. Don't forget that parents,
college students or commuity leaders can provide the needed leadership if
you can't.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Gaining Support from Students, Parents, and Community Members</B><BR>
Advocates for service-learning projects have stated that it's most helpful
when student team leaders, parents and the community are invited to attend
informative planning meetings that clarify roles, expectations and timelines
of service-learning projects.<BR>
Parents can offer an abundance support such as project coordination of other
volunteers, transporation, and soliciting for sponsors. Community members
appreciate being involved in the planning so that it provides the greatest
impact, adequately prepares students and insures success.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Be flexible </B><BR>
Community agencies frequently change personnel. If you plan to work over
several years expect some of the staffing to change. Should that happen,
you need to re-orient a new staff member to their roles and responsibilities.
It's important that students understand that things may not go as planned.
This is not a failure, but rather, an opportunity to learn. <BR>
The very nature of experiential education limits your ability to control
all elements of effort. As a teacher, you need to be open to questions and
concerns that you may not have anticipated, but don't feel responsible for
answering all of them. Instead, bring in resource people who can answer
those questions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Document: Evaluation and Assessment</B><BR>
Make sure you take care to evaluate the actual results of your program.
Through interviews and assessments you can more effectively determine the
actual benefits of your program. Some schools have incorporated service
into their portfolio assessment programs, while others are developing ways
to ways to assess academic and civic skills. Even though these methods are
just in the beginning stages, they promise to provide helpful feedback to
students and teachers alike.

<TITLE>Survey of Medical Studies on Quality</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY background="blue_pap.gif" bgcolor="#e6e8fa">

<H1><B>Published Research on Health Care Quality </B></H1>
<HR>

<P>
A growing body of published clinical studies shows that, compared
with ordinary, fee-for-service health insurance, HMO patients
receive more preventive care, receive treatment earlier after
the onset of illness, and in the face of serious illness, achieve
medical outcomes that are equivalent if not superior to fee-for-service
medicine. Among the studies documenting these findings are the
following:
<UL>
<LI>A comprehensive analysis of clinical literature published
from 1980-1994 comparing the quality of health care provided in
HMOs with care provided to similar populations in other settings
revealed that HMO quality-of-care results were better than or
equal to results in fee-for-service plans on 14 of 17 quality-of-care
measures (<I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>,
May 18, 1994).
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A study comparing nearly 100,000 adult appendicitis patients
in California showed that HMO members were 20% less likely to
suffer a ruptured appendix than fee-for service patients. The
researchers concluded that HMO patients were likely to receive
care quickly, while deductibles and higher co-payments may have
contributed to delays by fee-for-service patients in seeking care
(<I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>, August 18, 1994).
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A study of Medicare cancer patients found that, compared with
patients with ordinary insurance, HMO members were diagnosed at
significantly earlier stages for melanomas and cancers of the
breast, cervix, and colon (<I>American Journal of Public Health</I>,
October 1994).
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A study comparing treatment decisions among 140,000 patients
with clogged coronary arteries showed that HMO patients were 1.5
times more likely to undergo angioplasty or bypass surgery than
Medicaid patients. Fee-for-service patients were 2.3 times as
likely as Medicaid patients to undergo these procedures. Despite
the higher procedure rate in the fee-for-service group, there
was no difference in death rates between HMO and fee-for-service
patients (<I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>, December 9,
1993).
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A study of colorectal cancer patients found no differences
between HMO and fee-for-service patients in duration of symptoms
before diagnosis, training of physicians who analyzed the tumor,
anatomic location of the tumor, type of primary treatment, stage
at final analysis, or survival (<I>Cancer</I>, May 15, 1992).
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A randomized trial of elderly Medicaid beneficiaries in HMOs
and fee-for-service plans found that HMO patients were 16.6% less
likely to visit a physician's office, 21.2% less likely to visit
the emergency room, and 11.2% less likely to be hospitalized.
Hospital stays among HMO patients were 1.3 days shorter. Despite
using fewer services, HMO patients were found to be as healthy
as fee-for-service patients. No differences were found among beneficiaries'
reports of access to or satisfaction with care (<I>Annals of Internal
Medicine</I>, March 15, 1994).
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A RAND Corporation study found that HMO prenatal care surpassed
the national average in several key areas that influence the heath
of infants and expectant mothers. HMO rates of compliance with
48 treatments and services averaged 80% or more. For example,
approximately 87% of women in HMOs had their first prenatal care
visit during their first trimester, compared with a national average
of 76%. In addition, HMOs had a low birth weight rate of only
5%, compared with 7% nationwide (<I>Archives of Family Medicine</I>,
January 1994, Vol. 3).
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A study comparing treatment and mortality risk of low-income
prostate cancer patients found that HMO patients had significantly
lower mortality rates than those with fee-for-service coverage
(<I>American Journal of Public Health</I>, August 1992).
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A national study comparing the process and outcome of care
for hospitalized HMO and fee-for-service patients age 65 and older
with acute myocardial infarction showed no significant differences
in mortality 30 days or 180 days after admission. HMO patients
showed greater compliance with four of five scales measuring different
aspects of care: diagnostic testing, patient history taking and
physical examination, cardiac monitoring, and therapeutic interventions
(<I>American Journal of Public Health</I>, December 1992).

<H1><B>Consumer Satisfaction with Health Plans</B> </H1>

<P>
Numerous consumer satisfaction studies conducted on a national
and regional scale have shown that individuals enrolled in HMOs
are substantially more satisfied with their care and coverage
than those with traditional fee-for-service plans. Highlights
of the most recent of the surveys include the following:
<UL>
<LI>A national study of 25,000 health care consumers sponsored
by Xerox Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., and GTE Corp., showed
that employees who belong to HMOs are substantially more satisfied
with their overall care than those with fee-for-service insurance
plans. The study found that 86% of employees who belong to group
HMOs were satisfied with their health plans, compared with 74%
of those with fee-for-service plans. What's more, just 6% of group
practice members chose not to renew their membership at enrollment
time that year, while 37% disenrolled from fee-for-service plans.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A 1994 poll sponsored by MAHMO of 606 Massachusetts residents
found that 79% of HMO members said they would recommend their
health plan to a friend or relative, compared with 69% of individuals
covered under fee-for-service plans. The study also found that
84% of HMO members, compared with 73% of individuals in ordinary
plans, believe the benefits and services they receive for their
monthly premium make their plan a good value.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A 1994 national study conducted for the Group Health Association
of America underscored that HMO members join their plans by choice.
The study of 1,001 adults showed that 67% of American workers
who currently belong to HMOs were offered the choice to join a traditional fee-for-service plan. In striking contrast, only 34% of people with fee-for-service
coverage were offered a choice of another type of plan. In other
words, two-thirds of HMO members chose an HMO over other options,
while only about one in three fee-for-service subscribers did
so.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A 1993 national survey of 1,000 adults conducted by<I> The
Boston Globe</I> and the Harvard School of Public Health showed
that managed care plan enrollees were more willing to recommend
their health plan to friends or relatives than those in old-style
plans. In addition, managed care enrollees gave their plans higher
marks on referring them to specialists without a long waiting
time.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A report released by the New England Health Plan Employer
Data and Information Set (HEDIS) coalition, which compared the
region's HMOs on 114 criteria, showed widespread consumer satisfaction.
In the study, between 86% and 94% of consumers enrolled in New
England's five largest HMOs rated their plans as satisfactory
or better.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>A statewide poll released in December 1994 by the Massachusetts
Hospital Association showed that 86% of HMO members were satisfied
with their coverage, compared with only 78% of those with fee-for-service
insurance. In addition, 72% of HMO members said they were satisfied
with the cost of their HMO, compared with only 63% of people in
other types of health plans.

<H1><B>HMOs: Quality Health Care </B></H1>
<HR>

<H4><B>The HMO Difference </B></H4>

<P>
A growing body of published clinical research reveals that Health
Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) provide care that is equal and
often superior to traditional fee-for-service medicine.
<P>
A study reported in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>
comparing 100,000 appendicitis patients, for example, found that
HMO members were 20% less likely to suffer a ruptured appendix.
Moreover, research shows that HMO patients receive more preventive
care, and are treated earlier after diagnoses of serious illness,
than their fee-for-service counterparts.
<P>
It's no secret why HMOs have been so successful. The answer lies
in their innovative approach to health care delivery.
<H4><B>Continuity of Care </B></H4>

<P>
HMOs are made up of networks of doctors, hospitals, and other
health care providers. These networks allow HMOs to offer their
members access to a comprehensive array of health services. Upon
joining an HMO, a member selects a primary care physician who
provides routine treatment and coordinates and monitors the care
a patient receives from specialists.
<P>
This arrangement ensures that the treatment HMO members receive
is efficient and appropriate, and it eliminates the fragmented
care a patient may receive under traditional health insurance.<B>
</B>
<H4><B>Focus on Prevention </B></H4>

<P>
HMOs take an active interest in helping their members stay healthy.
They focus on the prevention and early detection and treatment
of health problems. Most provide broad access to primary care,
including routine physicals, mammograms, blood pressure tests,
and cancer screenings. HMOs also cover prenatal and well-baby
care.
<P>
In addition, HMOs typically offer health promotion services, such
as classes on nutrition, stress management, weight reduction,
smoking cessation, parenting, CPR, and first aid. Many HMOs offer
discounts at health clubs and fitness centers.
<H4><B>Careful Selection of Providers </B></H4>

<P>
Before hiring or contracting with physicians or other health care
providers, HMOs carefully evaluate their credentials. Once providers
become part of an HMO network, their qualifications and performance
are regularly reviewed. HMOs also help their doctors stay informed
of &quot;best practice&quot; guidelines and new medical techniques
and procedures.
<P>
As a result of this recruiting, screening, and training, HMO doctors
and other providers are well qualified. Nationally, approximately
85 percent of HMO doctors, but only about 61 percent of all doctors,
are certified by their specialty boards.
<H4><B>Internal Quality Controls </B></H4>

<P>
To promote appropriate, high-quality patient care, HMOs maintain
unique quality assurance and utilization management systems. These systems
allow HMOs to monitor and improve the treatment their members
receive.
<P>
HMO physician-review committees regularly look at patient treatment
histories in order to evaluate the appropriateness of all health
care services, with an eye toward identifying both under- and
over-utilization of care. Many HMOs, for example, routinely review
certain types of hospital admissions for conditions that might
have been prevented through closer or earlier preventive treatment.
Such an approach gives HMO members a level of accountability and
protection not available under ordinary coverage.
<H4><B>External Accountability </B></H4>

<P>
Massachusetts HMOs answer to a broad range of organizations that
measure health care quality. These organizations include federal
and state government agencies, private employers, and independent
non-profit review groups.
<P>
The National Committee for Quality Assurance, for instance, recently
initiated a rigorous HMO accreditation process. Local employer
coalitions, such as the Massachusetts Healthcare Purchaser Group,
collect data from HMOs that enable consumers to measure and compare
the quality of care in competing managed care plans. This kind
of information, which is unavailable in fee-for-service medicine,
also allows HMOs to identify areas where they can improve their
performance.
<H4><B>Putting Patients First </B></H4>

<P>
HMOs treat their members as valued customers. They provide consumer
safeguards generally unavailable in fee-for-service medicine,
such as formal complaint and grievance procedures, periodic satisfaction
surveys, and accessible member services departments. In addition,
HMO members are free to change primary care physicians if they
are not happy with their selections.
<H4><B>Satisfied Customers </B></H4>

<P>
A large number of national and regional studies have shown that
HMO members are substantially more satisfied with their care than
are people with other forms of coverage. For example, a recent
poll of Massachusetts residents sponsored by MAHMO revealed that
79% of HMO members would recommend their health plan to a friend
or relative, compared with 69% of individuals covered under ordinary
fee-for-service plans.

Association of HMOs at 617-523-3300 or send E-mail to</B></I>: <A HREF="mailto:mahmo@mahmo.org"><I>mahmo@mahmo.org</A></I></B></H5>

<H2>The Massachusetts Association of HMOs<IMG SRC=mahmo.jpg ALIGN="CENTER"></H3>
<HR>


<P>
The Massachusetts Association of HMOs (MAHMO) is an active trade
association representing 17 health maintenance organizations in
the Commonwealth. MAHMO's primary mission is to improve public
understanding of HMOs and to represent the interests of its member
health plans. Massachusetts HMOs employ approximately 15,000 people
and enroll over 2.2 million Bay State residents.
<P>
From its incorporation in 1982, MAHMO has worked to promote economic
and public policy conducive to the growth of HMOs in the Commonwealth.
The Association supports accessible, affordable, and universal
coverage within a market-based, competitive health care system.
In 1991, MAHMO joined in a successful effort to establish a new,
consumer-driven hospital financing system that replaced a regulated
approach. In 1992, MAHMO issued a detailed plan for expanding
access to health care for the uninsured, entitled <I>Facing Fiscal
Reality</I>.
<P>
Today, the Association has a full-time staff of 15 and is organized
into three functional areas. They include legislative advocacy,
research and policy analysis, and communications. MAHMO represents
member health plans before legislative and regulatory bodies.
The Association's legislative staff keeps elected officials informed
about the impact of proposed laws and conveys the Association's
position on bills that could affect HMOs.
<P>
In addition to analyzing legislation filed at the State House,
the research staff conducts studies on health policy. MAHMO's
communications staff responds to questions from the public and
the media, and works closely with HMO employees, business and
consumer groups, and community leaders to build support for HMOs.<B>
</B>
<H3>MAHMO is located at 18 Tremont Street in Boston. The Association
welcomes questions about the HMO industry or other health care
issues. For information, call 617-523-3300.</H3>

<H1><B>What are HMOs?</B> <IMG SRC="mahmo.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</H1>
<HR>

<P>
Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMOs, are health plans that
are responsible for delivering and paying for their members' medical
care. First created in the 1920s, HMOs, or pre-paid group practices,
have become very popular over the past decade because of their
success at making high-quality health care more available and
less costly. Today, more than 2.2 million Massachusetts residents
receive their health care through HMOs.
<P>
<B>Full Range of Benefits</B> 
<P>
HMOs provide access to services ranging from primary care office
visits to highly sophisticated medical intervention for life-threatening
conditions. They cover the full range of health care services,
including physician, hospital and out-patient services, laboratory
tests, x-rays, home care, rehabilitation therapy, mental health
care, and other services. HMOs also offer supplemental benefits,
such as prescription drugs.
<P>
<B>Low Out-of-Pocket Costs</B>
<P>
Unlike ordinary insurance, in which patients pay a fee each time
they receive medical services, HMOs provide health care coverage
for a fixed monthly premium that is, on average, much lower than
the cost of old-style health insurance. Moreover, while ordinary
insurance commonly covers only 80% of many medical expenses, HMOs
usually have minimal or no co-payments and do not require members
to pay deductibles. Not only do these practices save consumers
money, they remove financial barriers that can prevent people
from seeking treatment early, before health problems become severe.<B>
</B>
<P>
<B>Minimal Paperwork</B> 
<P>
The typical HMO member does not receive bills and does not have
to fill out a claims form for routine service. Generally, the
HMO--not the member--processes the paperwork. By minimizing the
paperwork traditionally associated with obtaining medical services,
HMOs make it simpler and less costly for their members to get
the health care they need.
<P>
<B>A Focus on Staying Well</B> 
<P>
HMOs take an active interest in helping their members stay healthy,
not simply treating them once they become ill, as conventional
health plans do. Most provide health education classes on topics
such as nutrition, stress management, smoking cessation, parenting,
CPR, and first aid. Many HMOs offer discounts at health clubs
and fitness centers and provide cancer screening and other tests
for early detection and treatment of disease.
<P>
<B>Networks: Controlling Costs, Ensuring Quality</B> 
<P>
HMOs employ or contract with select networks of doctors, hospitals,
and other types of health care providers. HMO members use providers
within their plan's network. This system has enabled HMOs to control
health care costs as well as monitor providers for quality. Because
HMOs direct a high volume of business to providers within a network,
providers are able to offer HMOs lower prices for their services.
<P>
Networks also enable HMOs to monitor the quality of care their
members receive. HMOs review their providers' credentials before
accepting them into the network. Once providers become part of
an HMO network, their performance is routinely reviewed. Teams
of physicians and other health care professionals regularly look
at patient treatment histories in order to evaluate the appropriateness
of all health care services. This practice, known as utilization
review or utilization management, discourages the use of unnecessary
procedures and duplicative tests, ensures that treatment is provided
in the most appropriate setting, and establishes high standards
of care.
<P>
<B>Emphasis on a Personal Physician Chosen by the Member</B> 
<P>
Upon joining an HMO, members select a primary care physician who
becomes both their personal doctor and their health care manager.
Primary care physicians advise patients on personal health issues,
diagnose and treat medical problems, and coordinate and monitor
the care patients receive from specialists. This system, known
as &quot;managed care,&quot; ensures that the treatment HMO members
receive is efficient and appropriate. By having a primary care
physician serve as a patient's guide through the health care system,
HMOs eliminate the fragmented treatment a patient may receive
under old-fashioned, ordinary health insurance.
<P>
<B>Increasing Access to Care</B> 
<P>
HMOs increase access to health care in a variety of ways. Attractive
HMO premiums enable more businesses to offer health insurance
benefits to their employees. In addition, HMOs' emphasis on preventive
care means members are covered for a broader range of health services
than are persons with ordinary insurance. Because members do not
have to file reimbursement claims or pay deductibles, and are
responsible for only minimal co-payments, HMOs remove financial
barriers present with old-style insurance that can discourage
people from seeking care. Finally, most HMOs do not impose restrictions
on pre-existing conditions or require waiting periods for persons
enrolling as part of a group.

<B>Q: <a name="What are HMOs">What are HMOs?</a></B>
<P>
Health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, are health plans that
deliver quality care at an affordable price.  Unlike conventional
insurers, who simply pay claims, HMOs combine both the health
care insurer and provider functions.  They pay for and provide--or
arrange to provide--access to a comprehensive range of medical
services for a fixed, prepaid premium
<P>
<B>Q: <a name="how differ">How do HMOs differ from other types of health insurers?</a></B>
<P>
<I>    A Focus on Staying Well. </I><B> </B>HMOs take an 
interest in helping their members stay healthy, not simply paying for treatment
once they become ill, as conventional health plans do.  HMOs
focus on the prevention, early detection, and treatment of health
problems.  They provide access to primary care, including routine
physicals, mamograms, blood pressure tests, and cancer screenings.
 HMOs also cover prenatal and well-baby care.   Many HMOs offer
health education classes and discounts at fitness centers.
<P>
<I>    Low Out-of-Pocket Costs.</I>  Unlike conventional insurance,
in which patients pay a percentage of the bill each time they receive medical services,
HMOs provide health care coverage for a fixed monthly premium
that is, on average, much lower than the cost of old-style, &quot;fee-for-service&quot;
health insurance.  Moreover, while ordinary insurance commonly
covers only 80% of many medical expenses, HMOs usually have minimal
co-payments and do not require members to pay deductibles.
 Not only do these practices save consumers money, they remove
financial barriers that can prevent people from seeking treatment
early, before health problems become severe.
<P>
<B> </B>
<P>
<I><B>    </B>Minimal Paperwork.</I>  The typical HMO member does
not receive bills and does not have to fill out a claims form
for routine service.  By minimizing the paperwork traditionally
associated with obtaining medical services, HMOs make it simpler
and less costly for their members to get the health care they
need 
<P>
<B>Q:  <a name="choice">Can HMO members choose their own doctors?</a></B>
<P>
HMOs employ or contract with select networks of doctors, hospitals,
and other types of health care providers.  HMO members must use providers
within their plan's network.  Patients who prefer a particular
doctor or health care facility usually make sure the provider
is part of an HMO's network and is accepting new patients before
enrolling in the plan. Upon joining an HMO, a member selects a
primary care physician from a list of doctors who work
for or are associated with the HMO.  A member's primary care physician
provides routine medical care, refers patients to specialists
within the network, and coordinates and monitors the treatment
the specialists provide. This arrangement ensures that the care
HMO members receive is efficient and appropriate, and it eliminates
the fragmented treatment a patient may receive with ordinary health
insurance.
<P>
<B>Q: <a name="quality">How do HMOs ensure their members receive quality care?</a></B>
<P>
Before hiring or contracting with physicians or other health care
providers, HMOs carefully evaluate their credentials.  Once providers
become part of an HMO network, their performance is routinely
reviewed.  Teams of physicians and other health care professionals
regularly look at patient treatment histories in order to evaluate
the appropriateness of all health care services.  This practice,
known as 'utilization review' or 'utilization management,' discourages
the use of unnecessary procedures and tests, ensures that treatment
is provided in the most appropriate setting, and establishes high
standards of care.  HMOs also help network doctors stay informed
of &quot;best practice&quot; guidelines and new medical techniques
and procedures.  As a result of this recruiting, screening, and
training, HMO doctors are well qualified.  Nationally, approximately
85 percent of HMO doctors, but only 61 percent of all doctors,
are certified by their specialty boards.  
<P>
In addition, HMOs answer to a broad range of organizations
that measure health care quality.  The organizations include federal
and state government agencies, private employers, and independent
non-profit review groups.  The National Committee for Quality
Assurance, for instance, recently initiated a rigorous HMO accreditation
process.  Local employer coalitions, such as the Massachusetts
Healthcare Purchaser Group, collect data from HMOs that enable
consumers to measure and compare the quality of care in competing
health plans.  This kind of information also allows HMOs to identify areas
where they can improve their performance.
<P>
<B>Q:  <a name="costs">Do HMOs really hold down health care costs?</a></B>
<P>
Yes, HMOs have shown that they can hold down employers' and consumers'
health care costs.  For example, group premium rates of Massachusetts
HMOs declined on average last year.  Nationally, businesses saw
their health care costs drop by an average of 1.1% in 1994, principally
because more employers shifted to managed care plans.  By offering
network doctors and hospitals a predictable volume of business,
HMOs can secure lower prices to pass along to employers and consumers.
 Also, HMOs hold down costs by focusing on preventive care, eliminating
the incentives for 'overtreatment' that exist with fee-for-service
coverage, and providing comprehensive, high quality care more
efficiently. 
<P>
<B>Q:  <a name="emergency">Do HMOs over emergency care?</a></B>
<P>
HMOs pay for treatment in a hospital emergency room in the case
of emergencies such as a serious injury or the onset of life-threatening
medical conditions.  In general, HMOs require a patient to seek
treatment for non-emergency health problems from the patient's
primary care doctor.  This practice allows HMO patients to be
treated in the most appropriate setting by doctors who are familiar
with their medical histories.  At the same time, it reduces the
use of costly emergency room care when such care is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Q: <a name="types">What are the different types of HMOs?</a></B>
<P>
A <I>staff model </I>HMO owns and operates health centers staffed
by physicians employed directly by the HMO.  In general, the health
centers offer patients access to a broad range of medical care
under one roof, including laboratory, x-ray, vision, and pharmacy
services.  A <I>group practice </I>HMO typically contracts with
medical groups who provide health care services to HMO members 
under one roof, and who see patients from other health plans.<I>  Independent
Practice Associations (IPAs) </I>are HMOs that contract with individual
physicians in private practice who provide care to HMO members
within a private office setting.
<P>
<B>Q: <a name="eligibility">Who is eligible to join an HMO?</a></B>
<P>
More than 2.3 million Massachusetts residents now belong to HMOs.
 Most are covered through their employer.  Some HMOs offer direct
enrollment for individuals not eligible for insurance through
a group.  In addition, many HMOs offer senior plans for Medicare
beneficiaries.  About 90,000 Massachusetts seniors currently belong
to HMOs.

SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT</font><font SIZE=+3>
</font></h1>

<center><p align=center><b><i><font SIZE=+1>Rebutting Some Common Myths
About HMOs</font></i></b></p></center>

<p>
<br>The criticism of HMOs and the idealization of fee-for-service medicine
has become a common theme in the media over recent months. To help set
the record straight, some common charges about HMOs are examined below.
</p>

<h1><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>Medical Decisions Are Made By Doctors</font></font><font SIZE=+3>
</font></h1>

<ul>
<p>Critics charge that medical decisions in HMOs are made by callous, number-crunching
bureaucrats bent only on increasing the health plan's bottom line. In fact,
medical decisions in HMOs are first made by the patient's treating physician
and may in certain circumstances be reviewed by the plan's medical director
or utilization review staff. </p>
</ul>

<h1><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>Doctors Don't Withhold Care</font><font SIZE=+3>
</font></font></h1>

<ul>
<p>Some claim that HMOs offer financial incentives to physicians to withhold
necessary care from patients and that doctors risk being expelled from
HMO networks if they provide costly treatments or tests. In truth, HMOs
encourage physicians to pursue the advantages of preventive care and early
intervention-precisely the opposite of limiting services. Quality incentives
in HMOs align the doctor and patient's best interests. Strategies such
as capitation encourage doctors to provide preventive care and to identify
health problems before the onset of more serious conditions that require
more expensive treatment. The notion that managed care imposes an ethical
dilemma upon doctors is being advanced by those seeking to evade accountability.
Physicians have an ethical and legal obligation to provide all medically
necessary care to their patients, regardless of how doctors are paid. Those
who argue that medicine should be free from economic constraints ignore
that the fee-for-service medical system has produced unsustainable cost
increases, fueled in part by built-in incentives for overtreatment. </p>
</ul>

<h1><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>HMOs Provide Quality Care</font><font SIZE=+3>
</font></font></h1>

<ul>
<p>Critics say that the quality of medical care in HMOs is inferior to
the care provided in traditional fee-for-service physician practices and
that HMO doctors aren't as good as fee-for-service doctors. This ignores
the fact that HMO physicians and fee-for-service physicians are one in
the same, since most physicians accept both HMOs and indemnity patients.
</p>

<p>Further this myth rests largely on the erroneous assumption that quality
in health care means an unlimited choice of doctors and services. In contrast,
HMOs know that organizing select networks of doctors, hospitals, pharmacies
and other health care providers can improve quality by ensuring that providers
meet rigorous standards. For example, approximately 85 % of HMO doctors
nationally are certified by their specialty boards-compared to only 61%
of all doctors. </p>

<p>An ever-growing body of clinical, peer-reviewed literature has documented
that HMO patients receive quality medical care. For example, a study reported
in the November 8, 1995, <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>
found no differences in the health outcomes for patients with hypertension
or non-insulin dependent diabetes whether they were treated in HMOs or
in fee-for-service practices. </p>
</ul>

<h1><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>Comprehensive Care For Mothers
And Babies </font></font></h1>

<ul>
<p>Some claim that HMO &quot;drive-through delivery&quot; practices jeopardize
the health of mothers and newborns. In truth, mothers and their newborns
in HMOs remain in the hospital following delivery for as long is medically
necessary. That determination is made by a physician, in consultation with
the mother, and subject to nationally recognized practice guidelines. Both
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American
Academy of Pediatrics have developed criteria that allow mothers and newborns
to go home within 48 hours of delivery when they are healthy and when good
follow-up care is provided in the home. Experts agree that shorter hospital
stays, if appropriate, can be advantageous. Birth is not an illness, and
many mothers want to return to the comfort of their homes as soon as possible.
In addition, many physicians find that home care is the most effective
way to follow up with a new mother, since it enables a complete assessment
of both health and home environmental issues. HMOs provide medical and
nursing support with thorough prenatal care and education beginning at
the earliest stages of pregnancy, not just in the hours and days mothers
spend in the hospital. Indeed, one of the great strengths of HMOs has always
been their commitment to fully covered prenatal and well-baby care. MAHMO
member plans support the maternity length of stay guidelines that went
into effect in February and will meet length of stay obligations as determined
by Department of Public Health guidelines. </p>
</ul>

<h1><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>HMOs Come In All Sizes</font><font SIZE=+3>
</font></font></h1>

<ul>
<p>Critics charge that HMOs are all big, for-profit corporations. In reality,
the HMO industry is tremendously diverse. A majority of HMOs operating
in Massachusetts are non-profit. These non-profit plans account for 88%
of the HMO members in Massachusetts. The Commonwealth's largest HMO, Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care, enrolls nearly 1 million members throughout eastern
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire. In comparison, Neighborhood
Health Plan, a Boston area HMO composed of a network of community health
centers, enrolls approximately 40,000 people, the majority of whom are
inner-city Medicaid residents. Virtually all HMOs in Massachusetts-for-profit
and non-profit alike-spend about 85 cents of every premium dollar on direct
health care costs. In general, the remaining sum goes to administrative
programs (such as quality improvement measures), financial reserves that
guarantee the HMO will be able to meet any catastrophic claims, and operating
expenses. </p>

<H1><B>Glossary of HMO-related Terms </B>
</H1>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Consumers often find the language of health care confusing.
Advances in medicine and recent public policy debates have produced
a new lexicon of words and acronyms. The growth of HMOs and managed
care also has had a major impact on the specialized vocabulary
of health care today. This glossary is intended to help consumers
by providing some basic definitions for commonly used HMO terms.
If you would like more detailed information, please let us know.
</I>
<P>
<I>_______________________________</I> 
<P>
<B>capitation </B>a method of compensation for health care services

First&quot; Campaign<BR>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="AGaramond">The American Association
of Health Plans held a press conference on December 17 to launch
its new &quot;Patients First&quot; initiative, the first step
in implementing the comprehensive Philosophy of Care code adopted
in 1996.  The initiative is a &quot;program to improve patient-physician
communications, streamline administrative procedures, and initiate
more research on the outcomes of care provided in health plans.&quot;
 AAHP President Karen Ignagni, Chairman of the Board Mickey Hebert,
and Quality of Care Committee Chairman Dr. George Isham spoke
about the initiative and also stated support for the Health Care
Financing Administration's recent statement advocating free communication
between Medicare beneficiaries and their physicians.  In addition,
AAHP issued a set of communications policy steps to be taken up
by all AAHP members.  The steps are intended to let managed care
patients know about what kinds of information they can expect
from their health plans.  By the end of the year, all member plans
are to provide inform</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond">ation on how
participating physicians are paid, including financial incentive
arrangements; utilization review procedures; the basis for utilization
decisions; whether a specific drug is covered by the plan; and
how the plan </FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="AGaramond">decides
whether a treatment or procedure is experimental.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">AAHP says that the steps are not only an
extension of the Philosophy of Care, but they underscore two key
managed care communications principles: &quot;Patients have a
right to information about health plans and how they work,&quot;
and &quot;Physicians should be encouraged to share information
with patients on their health status, medical conditions, and
treatment options.&quot;  The AAHP has formally stated its opposition
to gag clauses, which have been interpreted as restricting patient/physician
dialogue.<BR>

<B><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="AGaramond">MAHMO Files Two Uncompensated
Care Bills<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">MAHMO has filed two plans with the Legislature
that propose a comprehensive solution for dealing with the problem
of the uninsured.   While the plans differ in their funding sources,
both  act to assist uninsured people in purchasing health insurance
coverage as the primary way of addressing the uncompensated care
problem.  Rather than channel more money into the current uncompensated
care pool,   MAHMO believes that adequate coverage and care provided
in non-emergency settings will generate better care at far less
cost, and is a wiser use of limited resources.  The association
also assumes that the number of uninsured will be reduced by the
recently enacted Health Care Access Act. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">One plan is modeled after a Minnesota law
enacted in 1992.  It calls for a two percent assessment on the
gross revenues of most health care providers, to be used to fund
subsidies that would help uninsured Massachusetts residents purchase
individual, or non-group, health insurance.  A small portion of
the proceeds would be used to fund a scaled-down version of the
uncompensated care pool.  MAHMO estimates that a two-percent assessment
levied on the gross revenues of health care providers in Massachusetts
would raise approximately $302 million annually.  Most health
care providers would be subject to the assessment.  Revenue derived
from Medicare, Medicaid, and other government health care programs
would be exempt, as would revenues from home health care, nursing
homes, and hospice services. This plan also establishes a Health
Care Access Commission charged with collecting the revenue.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">MAHMO's second proposal seeks to ensure
that low and moderate income consumers will be able to afford
non-group coverage.  The bill provides premium subsides to individuals
and families with incomes less than 400% of the federal poverty
level who do not have access to employer-sponsored coverage. 
The bill also aims to keep non-group premiums affordable by providing
carriers with subsides for insuring high-risk individuals.  The
subsidies are funded by increases in the income, cigarette, and
alcohol taxes.  A portion of the proceeds would also fund a smaller
version of the uncompensated care pool.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">MAHMO's president, Robert Hughes, has been
addressing various interest groups to build support for MAHMO's
plans.  He gave presentations at the Associated Industries of
Massachusetts Health Care Committee in November and at the Massachusetts
Medical Society on December 4.  On December 10, Hughes will be
a panelist at a health care forum sponsored by the South Shore
Chamber of Commerce and the South Shore Business Partnership for
Health. </FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="AGaramond">Other panelists
include Charles Baker, Secretary of Administration and Finance;
Ron Hollander, of the Massachusetts Hospital Association; Rep.
John McDonough (D-Boston); Sen. Mark Montigny (D- New Bedford);
and Ron Zooleck, President of the South Shore Chamber of Commerce.
 Area businesses will be briefed on the status of free care in
the commonwealth and potential solutions.  The Uncompensated Care
Commission is considering both plans, among others, and must make
a recommendation to the Legislature by December 31.  Hughes is
a member of the commission</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000 FACE="Helvetica">.

for the 1997 Legislature: <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">* <U>An Act to Provide Senior Citizens

and HMOs to offer senior citizens more choices in the Medigap
market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">* <U>An Act Relative to Emergency Health
Care</U>:  includes the National Association of Insurance Commissioners'
recommendation to states on how to define a medical emergency.
 The definition is modified slightly to reflect the concerns stated
by emergency room physicians.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">* <U>An Act Permitting HMOs to Offer Point-of
Service Products</U>: allows HMOs to offer POS products under
HMO licensure and develop POS products for senior citizens.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">* <U>An Act Providing for the Further Regulation
of Health Maintenance Organizations</U>: brings Massachusetts
General Laws into conformity with federal law.  It would restrict
an HMO's ability to provide non-emergent services through non-network
physicians.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">* <U>An Act to Increase the Affordability
of Health Insurance</U>: One of MAHMO's uncompensated care plans,
as discussed above.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">* <U>An Act to Provide Affordable Health
Care to the Uninsured and Underinsured Residents of the Commonwealth</U>:
 MAHMO's other proposed solution to the uncompensated care pool
problem, as outlined on the previous page.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">* <U>An Act Prohibiting Discrimination
in the Provision of Certain Health Care Services:</U> Would make
it unlawful for any licensed provider to discriminate against
any patient because of the type of insurance under which he or
she is covered.<BR>

HMOs it does not routinely hear: that of health care purchasers.
 MAHMO also wanted to emphasize that the anecdotal  horror stories
(especially from other states) reported in the press do not reflect

Held On Non-Group Law <BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">The Division of Insurance held a hearing
on September 17 with industry officials to discuss the state's
new non-group insurance law.  Under the new law, non-group insurers
must issue policies to anyone wishing to be insured.  Premiums
must be based on age and geography only; ratings based on gender
or preexisting medical conditions are not permitted.  Small-group
insurers must also offer non-group insurance.  Commercial insurance
representatives, who called for amendments to the law, fear that
not only will small-group insurers stop doing business in Massachusetts,
but in the wake of this premiums will go up to unaffordable levels,
leaving many people uninsured.  They cited Kentucky's recent reforms,
similar to Massachusetts', which caused many insurers to stop
doing business with the state.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">However, a spokesperson for Kentucky's
Department of Insurance pointed out that while some companies
did leave, the main insurer, Blue Cross/ Blue Shield, remained,
and many people who were not previously covered now are.  MAHMO,
along with The Office of the Attorney General, the National Association
of Independent Businesses, Blue Cross Blue Sheild of Massachusetts
and others, submitted a letter to the division expressing full
support for the law.   The division will issue regulations before
the first open enrollment period in June. <BR>

with an opportunity to explain how they are structured to provide
 comprehensive, cost-effective health care.  Under the Managed
Care Working Group's new format, the chairs of the of the health

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">The Legislature's Managed Care Working
Group is reconstituting itself into a format which is designed
to better address the individual concerns of interest groups.
 The working group is composed of representatives of insurer,
provider, consumer, and business organizations.  MAHMO is a member
of the group.  Subgroup meetings, which have been held twice,
will no longer be held.  Instead of the group meetings, the respective
chairs of the health care and insurance committees will meet with
the various constituency groups on a group-by-group basis.  The
chairs thus hope to hear what the issues for each group are to
better identify key issues and gather information regarding potential
reform of the state's HMO laws.  The HMO industry will have its

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">State Representatives Marie Parente
(D- Milford) and Douglas Petersen (D- Marblehead) are sponsoring
a bill which seeks to require HMO clinics to provide care to any
person who needs emergency treatment, regardless of whether or
not that person is a member of the HMO.  Under Massachusetts law,
hospitals cannot turn away anyone needing emergency care.  The
bill puts clinics under the same stricture and imposes a $50,000
fine for any HMO violating the law.  Individuals could also sue
the HMO for damages.  While Parente says the bill would put and
end to the &quot;troubling trend&quot; of HMOs &quot;dumping patients
who are non-members,&quot;  the bill was branded as &quot;political
grandstanding&quot; by an editorial in the Worcester Telegram
and Gazette.  MAHMO maintains the legislation is unnecessary because
HMOs with clinics already have policies in place to treat anyone
in need regardless of membership.<BR>

status of the free care pool and existing medicaid waivers.  This
in turn generated requests for additional information to be given

chairs of the joint committees on health care and insurance to

are needed in the state's HMO laws.  The chairs plan to file legislation
by December for the 1997 session that will have broad implications

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">Seven Massachusetts HMOs rate among
the best health plans nationally for preventive care, according
to a survey contained in the September 2 issue of <I>U.S. News
&amp; World Report</I>.  The 7 HMOs made the magazine's &quot;Honor
Roll,&quot; which included 21 health plans that garnered four
stars for high standards in preventive care. <I> </I>The <I>U.S.

access through a link from MAHMO's home page.  MAHMO's Internet
address is &lt;http://www.mahmo.org&gt;.  <I>U.S. News</I> based
its survey on data provided by 151 HMOs to the National Committee
for Quality Assurance (NCQA).  NCQA recently released a major
database containing information on the quality of HMO care.  That
database, called Quality Compass, compared health plans across
the country on a series of preventive care measures.  It showed
that New England HMOs scored better than the national average
on most measures.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">The <I>U.S. News</I> survey and
the NCQA findings follow two similar studies published recently
that showed Massachusetts HMOs to be among the nation's best.
 The June 24 issue of <I>Newsweek </I>contained results of a survey
rating 43 of the largest HMOs in the country.  Six Massachusetts
HMOs were included in the survey, and all six achieved either
&quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;very good&quot; overall scores.
 In addition, the August issue of <I>Consumer Reports</I> rated
51 HMOs according to overall member satisfaction.  Three Massachusetts
HMOs scored among the top 4 health plans in the survey.  The ratings
were based on more than 20,000 responses to a questionnaire distributed
to the magazine's subscribers.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">Bill Filed to Regulate Utilization
Review<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">Rep. Douglas Petersen (D-Marblehead)
has filed legislation to regulate the utilization review process.
 According to Petersen, the legislation seeks to &quot;establish
clear standards and a certification procedure for all utilization
review agents making final clinical judgements about their colleagues
clinical requests and about pre-approval for patient care.&quot;
 Petersen's bill also seeks to &quot;establish a clear and expedient
appeal process with final determination by the Department of Public
Health.&quot;  MAHMO has said that the legislation is unnecessary
because utilization review professionals in Massachusetts HMOs
already meet high standards, and all HMOs in the commonwealth
provide their members with a process for appealing clinical decisions
and addressing grievances.  Because the bill is a late-file bill
and has not been admitted in either the House or Senate, it is
unlikely that the Legislature will act on it before the beginning
of the 1997 session.</FONT>

the joint committees on health care and insurance announced their
intention to file legislation by next December for the 1997 session

<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">The final weeks of the formal session of
the state legislature saw enactment of several laws of particular
interest to HMOs:</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Nongroup Reform--Chapter 297</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">A law was enacted that will require most
carriers who participate in the small group market to sell nongroup
insurance, as well.  The law establishes an annual two-month open
enrollment period, during which carriers will be required to sell
nongroup policies to any individual ineligible for group or government-sponsored
coverage.  The first open-enrollment period is tentatively scheduled
for June and July of 1997.  The law also prohibits pre-existing
condition exclusions and waiting periods, and includes a prescription
drug benefit.  Nongroup premiums must be based on age and geography
only.  Finally, the legislation expands the application of the
small group law to include groups of 26-50 people.  The nongroup
reform law is the product of months of negotiations among the
co-chairs of the Insurance Committee, MAHMO, Blue Cross Blue Shield,
Health Care for All, the Massachusetts Business Association, the
Weld administration, and others. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Expansion of Health Care Access--Chapter
203</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">The Legislature overrode Governor Weld's
veto of the Health Care Access Act.  MAHMO was a member of the
coalition that advocated passage of this law, which expands Medicaid
eligibility, establishes a prescription drug subsidy program for
seniors, and extends eligibility for the Children's Medical Security
Plan (CMSP) to adolescents aged 13-18.  These new programs are
financed through an increase in the state cigarette tax and new
federal funds.  The law also repeals the often-deferred employer
health insurance mandate passed during the Dukakis administration.
 The law does not authorize the Insurance Reimbursement Program
(IRP) supported by the Weld administration.  The program sought
to encourage employer-based coverage through tax credits and purchase
subsidies.  The law does require a special commission to develop
a plan for implementing the IRP.  The commission is also charged
with developing a legislative proposal that &quot;deals both with
the issues of a fair and equitable assessment to pay for uncompensated
care, and the fair and equitable distribution of any assessment.&quot;
 The commission's recommendations must be submitted to the legislature
by December 31, 1996.</FONT>

<B>Health Care Access Bill Advances</B>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Helvetica">An Act to Improve Health
Care Access, now numbered H. 6195, is headed to the governor's
desk, after passing both the House and Senate.  Among its provisions,
H. 6195 would dedicate proceeds from an increase in the cigarette
tax to expand health care coverage for children and to fund a
new prescription drug subsidy program for low-income seniors.
 The bill also repeals the often-deferred employer health insurance
mandate passed during the Dukakis administration.  The bill is
sponsored by the co-chairs of Joint Committee on Health Care,
Rep. John McDonough (D-Jamaica Plain) and Sen. Mark Montigny (D-New
Bedford), and backed by a broad-based coalition that includes
MAHMO, Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the Greater Boston
Chamber of Commerce, and the Massachusetts Business Roundtable.

<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Uncompensated Care Issue Continues to
Play a Role</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">The health care access bill passed both
chambers by the two-thirds majority that will be needed to override
an expected veto by Governor Weld, who opposes the bill's tax
increase.  The governor has said he favors an alternative approach
to funding expanded health care coverage that would rely on $161
million from the state's uncompensated care pool.  The governor
also has proposed requiring HMOs and insurers to make direct payments
into the pool, an arrangement similar to one offered by Sen. Henri
Rauschenbach (R-Brewster) in an unsuccessful amendment to the
Senate budget.  A similar proposal was later filed as a bill by
Sen. Marc Pacheco (D-Taunton).  At a July 10 public hearing, MAHMO
testified on several bills dealing with the issue of uncompensated
care.  MAHMO President Robert Hughes expressed concern that, under
the proposed direct contribution arrangement, HMOs and insurers
would pay twice for uncompensated care.  Richard Lord of Associated
Industries echoed Hughes' concern.  Currently, HMOs and insurers
pay for free care in their reimbursements to hospitals, and the
governor's proposal would prohibit an HMO from reducing its current
contracted payment rate with a hospital.  MAHMO has also said
the proposal would not apply to employers with self-insured plans,
which currently pay for free care and which provide health coverage
to about half the state's insured population.  As a result, the
legislation would unfairly shift responsibility for funding free
care to employers that do not self-insure, typically small businesses.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">Hughes said MAHMO supported a deliberate
study of the financing of the uncompensated care pool.  He said
that the association was committed to participating in a solution
that was fair to all parties.  H. 6195 includes a provision that
calls for a study commission to develop a plan to improve the
way the uncompensated care pool is funded.    </FONT>

the product of months of negotiations among the co-chairs of the
Insurance Committee, MAHMO, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Health Care
for All, the Massachusetts Business Association, the Weld administration,
and others.  H. 5601 would require most carriers who participate
in the small group market to sell nongroup insurance, as well.
 It would establish an annual two-month open enrollment period,
during which carriers would be required to sell nongroup policies
to any individual ineligible for group or government-sponsored
coverage.  The bill would prohibit pre-existing condition exclusions
and waiting periods, and would include a prescription drug benefit.
 Nongroup premiums would be based on age and geography only. 
Finally, the legislation would expand the application of the small
group law to includes groups of 26-50 people.  </FONT>

Prohibiting Financial Incentives to Health Care Providers.  The
bill, sponsored by Rep. Douglas Petersen (D-Marblehead), aims
to prevent insurers and HMOs from establishing financial incentives
that encourage providers to deny patients medically necessary
care.  Hughes urged committee members to amend the legislation
to ensure that it applies explicitly to only those incentives
that may serve as inducements to deny medically necessary and
appropriate care.  Hughes also said that the incentives HMOs include
in provider contracts are meant to deter unnecessary or inappropriate
care and to encourage preventive care and early treatment.</FONT>

<p>MAHMO helped defeat a proposed amendment to the Senate budget that would
have radically changed the way uncompensated care is paid for in Massachusetts.
The amendment would have required HMOs and insurers to make direct payments
into the state's uncompensated care pool. MAHMO expressed concern that
the proposed change would not apply to employers with self-insured plans,
which currently pay for free care and which provide health coverage to
about half the state's insured population. As a result, the legislation
would unfairly shift responsibility for funding free care to employers
that do not self-insure. MAHMO also said that if the amendment passed,
HMOs and insurers would be taxed twice to pay for uncompensated care. Currently,
HMOs and insurers pay for uncompensated care in their reimbursements to
hospitals, and the amendment would have prohibited an HMO from reducing
its current contracted payment rate with a hospital. MAHMO did support
a successful amendment to the Senate budget that would establish a commission
to develop a plan to improve the way the uncompensated care pool is funded.
A conference committee of Senate and House members is currently working
to resolve differences in the budgets passed by each chamber. The House
budget does not call for creation of such a commission.
<br></p>

<center><p><b>Amended Nongroup Reform Bill Expected Soon</b></p></center>

<p>Negotiations are nearly complete on changes to a major nongroup reform
bill (H. 5601), which currently sits in the House Ways and Means Committee.
MAHMO expects the committee to take action on the bill soon. In conjunction
with the co-chairs of the Insurance Committee, MAHMO, Blue Cross Blue Shield,
Health Care for All, the Massachusetts Business Association, the Weld administration,
and others have been working to craft a bill that addresses the problem
of access and that is fair to all. 
<br></p>

<center><p><b>Action Expected Soon on Health Care Access Bill</b></p></center>

<p>The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to act soon on a bill
intended to reduce the number of uninsured Massachusetts residents. Among
its provisions, the bill would dedicate proceeds from an increase in the
cigarette tax to expand health care coverage for children and to fund a
new prescription drug subsidy program for low-income seniors. It would
also broaden eligibility for Medicaid and increase eligibility for the
Children's Medical Security Plan from age 12 to 18. If approved, the bill
(H. 5905) would be taken up by the full House. Speaker Thomas Finneran
has said publicly that he supports the bill and that it is on the &quot;short
list&quot; of legislation he would like to see passed this session. MAHMO
is a member of the Coalition to Improve Health Care Access, which is backing
the bill. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Governor Weld has announced that he will also file legislation
to reduce the number of uninsured Massachusetts residents. Weld's proposal
is reported to be similar to legislation he first proposed two years ago.
The governor's plan is expected to broaden eligibility for Medicaid and
increase eligibility for the Children's Medical Security Plan from age
12 to 18--provisions that are also in H. 5905. It also would allow the
elderly a $1200 tax deduction for their health care expenses, including
the cost of purchasing prescription drugs. The governor's plan also is
expected to create direct premium subsidies for low-income employees and
families, as well as tax credits for some employers who provide health
insurance. The reforms would be paid for primarily with $161 million from
the uncompensated care pool. </p>

<center><p><b>Hearing Scheduled for Benefit Mandate Legislation</b></p></center>

<p>The Insurance Committee has scheduled a public hearing for June 5 on
two bills that would alter the way HMOs contract with pharmacies. H. 6034
would broaden the statutory definition of &quot;restricted pharmacy network.&quot;
H. 6033 would force HMOs that contract with the Group Insurance Commission
to comply with the Division of Insurance's interpretation of the 1994 pharmacy
law. In addition, the committee will hear testimony on H. 6052, which would
require HMOs and insurers to provide coverage for a scalp hair prosthesis
worn for hair loss suffered as a result of treatment for cancer. 
<br></p>

<center><p><b>Other Legislation of Note</b></p></center>

<p><b>H. 5917</b>, the Patient Protection Act, remains in the Insurance
Committee. <b>S. 1927</b>, legislation pertaining to emergency room services,
is pending in the Senate Ways and Means Committee. The House Ways and Means
Committee has yet to act on <b>H. 5956 </b>(formerly 5908), legislation
that would further regulate the sale of nonprofit HMOs and hospitals to
for-profit corporations.

<h2><center><b>On the Legislative Front</b>
<br></center>
</h2>

<h3><b>MAHMO Testifies Against Anti-Managed Care Bill</b></h3>

<p>MAHMO President Robert Hughes testified May 1 against a bill that would
require HMOs to furnish prospective members with a broad range of information
that the health plans already provide in one form or another. The bill,
H. 5917, An Act to Protect Patients, is sponsored by Rep. David Cohen (D-Newton).
Hughes told members of the Joint Committee on Insurance that the requirements
this bill seeks to impose on HMOs either already exist in law or regulation
or are unnecessary because the information being sought is provided in
plan informational materials. Hughes said the duplicative and ill-defined
provisions of the bill will only add to the administrative burden and expense
of providing health coverage with no corresponding benefit to the consumer.
He added that the bill fails to address the role of employers in providing
benefit information to their employees. He also said the bill reflects
an inherent distrust of physicians and the medical profession in its requirement
that HMOs list any &quot;financial incentives&quot; they provide to doctors.
Hughes told committee members that MAHMO member HMOs do not restrict and
have not restricted physicians from discussing compensation, utilization
review practices, or any other topic with their patients; nor are HMO consumers
precluded from asking their physicians questions regarding financial incentives.</p>

<h3><b>Committee Approves Non-Profit Conversion Bill</b></h3>

<p>In April, the Joint Committee on Health Care approved a bill, H. 5908,
that would further regulate the sale of nonprofit HMOs and hospitals to
for-profit corporations. The bill, which has been renumbered H. 5956, was
sent to the House Ways and Means Committee. Among its provisions, the bill
would require purchasers of nonprofit HMOs or hospitals to pay for an &quot;access
monitor,&quot; who for three years would ensure the new entity provided
as much free care and community benefits as its predecessor. At an April
3 public hearing, MAHMO President Robert Hughes told members of the Health
Care Committee that the legislation is misguided and decidedly not in the
public interest. Hughes said the bill could reduce access to affordable,
high quality medical care by preventing a struggling nonprofit HMO or hospital
from seeking out a for-profit partner. Hughes also argued that the bill
constitutes &quot;a form of economic protectionism . . . aimed at preserving
the status quo&quot; because it would discourage for-profit and out-of-state
health care providers from doing business in Massachusetts. Hughes added
that the legislation blurs the critical distinctions between HMOs and hospitals,
could create unnecessary and duplicative regulation, inappropriately expands
the powers of the attorney general's office, and encroaches on the judiciary's
authority to reallocate charitable assets. 
<br></p>

<p><b>Committee Considering Changes to Health Care Access Bill</b></p>

<p>The House Ways and Means Committee is currently considering a bill intended
to reduce the number of uninsured Massachusetts residents. H. 5905 was
approved on March 27 by the Health Care Committee, which recommended removal
of a provision requiring employers to contribute at least half the cost
of individual health insurance coverage for employees working a minimum
of 20 hours per week, or pay $1200 per employee annually to a state trust
fund. The bill retains provisions that broaden eligibility for Medicaid
and extend Medicaid coverage to the long-term unemployed. It also dedicates
proceeds from an increase in the cigarette tax to expand health care coverage
for children and to fund a new prescription drug subsidy program for low-income
seniors. MAHMO is a member of the Coalition to Improve Health Care Access,
which is backing the legislation.</p>

<h3><b>Negotiations Continue on Nongroup Reform Legislation</b></h3>

<p>Work continues on a major nongroup reform bill (H. 5601), which currently
sits in the House Ways and Means Committee. In conjunction with the co-chairs
of the Insurance Committee, MAHMO, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Health Care
for All, the Massachusetts Business Association and others have been working
to craft a bill that addresses the problem of access and that is fair to
all. MAHMO is encouraged by the progress negotiators are making on some
difficult issues.</p>

<h3><b>MAHMO Keeps Anti-HMO Legislation Out of House Budget</b></h3>

<p>The House of Representatives approved a state budget in April for fiscal
year 1997. During the budget debate, MAHMO worked successfully to prevent
inclusion in the budget of several outside sections that would have been
damaging to HMOs. Legislators often use outside sections to amend current
law or to enact legislation currently languishing in a committee. Proposals
were made to amend the pharmacy law, require HMOs to pay for the services
of educational psychologists and mental health counselors, and broaden
the definition of emergency, leading to the inappropriate expansion of
coverage for non-emergency services in a hospital emergency facility. The
Senate is expected to begin budget deliberations this month.</p>

<h3><b>Scalp Prostheses Mandate Moves Forward</b></h3>

<p>House Bill 4483, which would require HMOs and insurers to provide coverage
for wigs when an individual has suffered hair loss as result of alopecia
or permanent injury, has been approved by the Senate Ways and Means Committee
and sent to the Senate Steering and Policy Committee. </p>

<B><h3>Committee Approves 'Health
Care Minimum Wage' Bill </h3><BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">On March 27, the Health Care Committee
approved legislation intended to reduce the number of uninsured
Massachusetts residents.  The bill, a redraft of legislation filed
in January, would require employers to contribute at least half
of the cost of individual health insurance coverage for employees
working a minimum of 20 hours per week, or pay $1200 per employee
annually to a state trust fund.  This requirement would not take
effect until January 1, 2000.  The bill repeals the Chapter 23
employer mandate that is currently scheduled to take effect in
August.  In addition, the bill broadens eligibility for Medicaid
and extends Medicaid coverage to the long-term unemployed.  It
dedicates proceeds from an increase in the cigarette tax to expand
health care coverage for children and to fund a new prescription
drug subsidy program for low-income seniors.  The bill also amends
the small business health insurance law to include all firms of
up to 50 employees, establishes a task force to examine alternative
methods of financing the uncompensated care pool, and authorizes
funds for a study of implementing a single payer health care system
for Massachusetts.  The bill does not include the employer tax
credit and employee purchase subsidy plan it contained originally,
nor does its call for using uncompensated care pool funds to help
pay for expanded insurance coverage. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><h3>Hearing Scheduled for Non-Profit Conversion
Bills</h3><BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">A public hearing was scheduled for Wednesday
April 3 on several bills that regulate the sale of non-profit
HMOs and hospitals to for-profit corporations.  H. 5902 and H.
5908 would expand the powers of the attorney general and the Department
of Public Health over such transactions.  H. 5908 omits a controversial
provision of H. 5902 that makes the legislation applicable to
all transactions for which notice had been given to the attorney
general as of March 6, 1996.  H. 5908 was filed to address concerns
that the notification date could effect the pending purchase of
parts of the Fallon Healthcare System by the for-profit OrNda
HealthCorp.  Two additional bills were filed March 29 and, at
press time, it was not clear whether they would be included in
the hearing.  H. 5910 would prohibit the issuance of licences
for for-profit HMOs in Massachusetts after January 1, 1997.  H.
5911 would prohibit the issuance of original licenses for for-profit
hospitals.  MAHMO has expressed serious concerns with all of these
bills, which the association believes would place an unfair burden
on for-profit and non-profit health care providers alike and would
likely have a negative impact on the future health care marketplace.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">Rep. David Cohen's &quot;Patients' Protection
Act of 1996&quot; has been filed in the House and should soon
be admitted to the Senate.  Once admitted, the legislation will
be assigned to the Insurance Committee. MAHMO continues to express
its concern that the bill is unnecessary and will only introduce
confusion and useless new administrative costs into an already
well-functioning system.  The bill requires all insurers and HMOs
to disclose an array of information to prospective members prior
to the purchase or selection of a health plan.  HMOs already provide
much of this information in the evidence of coverage as required
by law.  Other information that may not be included in the evidence
of coverage is readily available by request.  A hearing has not
yet been scheduled for the bill.<BR>

<B><h3>Mental Health Counselors Mandate Advances</h3>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">A bill that would require HMOs and insurers
to contract with and pay for the services of mental health counselors
(S. 1940) has been approved by the Senate and referred to the
House.  MAHMO is seeking to clarify the legislation so it conforms
to standard HMO selective contracting and physician referral practices.

<B><h3>Hearings Held on Maternity Stay Regulations</h3>
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">Hearings were held March<B> </B>13 and
18 on emergency regulations implementing the new maternity law.
 MAHMO submitted written testimony to the Department of Public
Health that recommended two significant changes.  First, the association
urged removal of a regulatory provision calling for a woman to
approve her attending physician's decision to discharge her any
earlier than the statutory minimum length of stay.  MAHMO argued
that the provision, which contradicts legislative intent, invites
the mother &quot;to distrust her physician's judgement and believe
the only safe alternative for her and her baby is the 'minimal'
48-hour stay.&quot;  MAHMO also urged the department to shorten
the 6:00 P.M. to 9:00 A.M. &quot;black out period,&quot; during
which no discharges can take place without the mother's consent.
 MAHMO noted that many new mothers view this black out period
as &quot;a statement that they should be staying in the hospital
during this period for their own health and the health of their
babies.&quot;  Both provisions, MAHMO wrote, &quot;introduce unnecessary
anxiety into the discharge decision.&quot;  Dr. John Straus, Chief
of Pediatrics at the Fallon Healthcare System, testified at the
March 13 hearing in Worcester.</FONT>

<B>Negotiations Heat Up on Nongroup Reform Bill <BR>
</B>
<P>
Negotiations have intensified on a major nongroup reform bill
(H 5601, An Act to Increase Affordability and Accessibility of
Health Insurance in Massachusetts) that emerged from the Insurance
Committee last fall. H. 5601 currently sits in the House Ways
and Means Committee. In conjunction with the committee, MAHMO,
Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, Health Care for All, the Massachusetts
Business Association and others have been working to craft a nongoup
reform bill that addresses the problems of affordability and access
and that is fair to all. A working redraft of the original bill
would require carriers with at least 5000 small group members
to sell nongroup policies during a two-month open enrollment period.
It would prohibit carriers from imposing pre-existing condition
exclusions and waiting periods. In addition, the bill contains
a controversial prescription drug mandate for non-group policies.
MAHMO is concerned that these provisions would have a negative
impact on the nongroup and small group markets. The bill also
contains an 80 percent loss ratio requirement. MAHMO believes
that loss ratios do not achieve their stated goal of controlling
premiums and are incompatible with the basic structure of HMOs.
Finally, the redraft would tighten permissible small group and
nongroup rate variations, a provision that MAHMO believes may
price younger individuals out of the insurance market.<BR>

<P>
<B>Another Anti-Managed Care Bill Emerges<BR>
</B>
<P>
On February 27, Rep. David Cohen (D-Newton) sent a letter to his
colleagues asking them to co-sponsor a bill called the &quot;Patients'
Protection Act of 1996.&quot; In support of his bill, Rep. Cohen
claims that &quot;financial pressures on providers to deny care
are common&quot; and that insurers and HMOs do not now provide
sufficient information for consumers to make a fully informed
choice of health plan. MAHMO has responded in part by asking lawmakers
to consider some of the myths that underlie the bill. In a letter
provided to each state representative, MAHMO noted that HMOs already
provide their prospective members most of the information identified
in Rep. Cohen's bill, either in their evidences of coverage, through
routine correspondence, or upon request of the member. In other
words, the letter argued, Rep. Cohen's bill is simply unnecessary
and will only introduce confusion and useless new administrative
costs into an already well-functioning system, without offering
any additional benefits to HMO members. With regard to physician
payment, the letter noted that doctors are already free to discuss
their compensation with patients. Health plans already publicly
disclose their financial status, forms of provider contract, health
outcome statistics and a host of other information. Though Rep.
Cohen's bill has yet to be filed, MAHMO continues to educate lawmakers
and the media about the problems the bill would create if enacted.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Non-profit Conversion Bill Filed<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Health Care Committee is currently considering legislation
intended to regulate sales of non-profit HMOs and hospitals to
for-profit corporations. MAHMO has serious concerns with the bill,
which would expand the authority of the attorney general and the
Department of Public Health (DPH) to review these transactions
and to continue to regulate the HMO or hospital after the transaction
is complete. Presently, court approval is required before a public
charity may be sold to a for-profit company. The attorney general
reviews the transaction and makes a recommendation to the court.
The Health Care Committee bill would require the purchaser to
bear the costs of the attorney general's review. In addition,
control and governance of the charity formed with the proceeds
of the sale would be subject to the approval of the attorney general.
Purchasers of non-profit HMOs and hospitals would be required
to fund an &quot;independent health care access monitor&quot;
appointed by DPH, who would report quarterly to DPH, the attorney
general, and the Legislature for three years. The monitor would
report on community health care access and on free care provided
by the now for-profit HMO or hospital. The monitor would have
access to the records of the HMO or hospital. The bill does not
affect the attorney general's ability to review the transaction
for antitrust compliance, nor does it affect licensure of HMOs
by the Division of Insurance. MAHMO met with the Health Care Committee
staff last week to discuss its objections to the bill, including
the concern that the bill would place an unfair burden on for-profit
health care providers and that it would likely have a negative
impact on the market place.<BR>

<P>
<B>Markey Files Physician Protection Bill<BR>
</B>
<P>
On February 26, Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Rep. Greg
Ganske, M.D., of Iowa introduced legislation in Congress that
ostensibly tries to ban 'gag clauses' in doctors' contracts with
HMOs and insurers. The bill--the Patient Right to Know Act of
1996--comes in the wake of frenzied and inaccurate media reporting
following a December editorial by Dr. David Himmelstein published
in the New England Journal of Medicine about health plan non-disparagement
clauses. In a letter to Rep. Markey, MAHMO President Robert Hughes
wrote that the bill not only adopts findings that are incorrect,
it unnecessarily and inappropriately interferes with important
mechanisms designed to protect patients and assure good care.&quot;
The letter differentiated Markey's bill from the &quot;straightforward,
clear&quot; Massachusetts gag clause statute, which MAHMO supported.
MAHMO's letter concluded that Markey's bill &quot;protects providers,
not patients,&quot; and reasoned that doctors are &quot;perfectly
free now to communicate with patients regarding their conditions
and available treatment options.&quot; MAHMO has invited Rep.
Markey to visit health plans operating in his district and to
meet with plan members and employees to learn more about how HMOs
operate. <BR>

<FONT FACE="Helvetica">On January 19, Governor Weld signed into
law H. 5347, An Act Further Protecting the Confidentiality of
Patients.  The law prohibits HMOs and insurers from refusing to
contract with a provider--or canceling a provider's contract--solely
because he or she has discussed plan benefits with patients. 
MAHMO President Robert Hughes said the association welcomed the
legislation's passage: &quot;The Massachusetts' Medical Society's
claim that HMOs impose gag clauses on doctors was and is simply
not true.  If that were true, it would be reprehensible.  We have
fully backed this legislation from the beginning.  HMOs are committed
to open communication between doctor and patient.&quot;  The new

treatment.<BR>

Costs<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Helvetica">Health care costs for businesses
grew only 2.1 percent last year, according to the annual survey
conducted by Foster Higgins &amp; Co., the New York benefits-consulting
firm.  Most of that increase was fueled by higher costs of health
insurance for retirees.  Costs for current employees grew only
one-tenth of a percentage point.  The study attributed the small
increase to the growing number of workers enrolling in managed
care plans.  In addition, a recently-released KPMG Peat Marwick
study found that hospitals in cities with a high concentration
of managed care plans had costs 11.2 percent lower than the national
average.  Those hospitals also reported 6.3 percent shorter patient
stays and 5.3 percent lower death rates.  According to KPMG's
Michael Hamilton, the study offers &quot;'strong empirical data
that managed care does have a positive impact on cost without
sacrificing quality.'&quot;<BR>

<CENTER><B>Maternity Regulations Issued<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Helvetica">The Department of Public
Health (DPH) has promulgated emergency regulations implementing
the recently enacted law governing hospital maternity stays. 
Though the law does not take effect until February 19, the department
acted now to allow hospitals enough time to prepare to meet new
requirements set forth in the regulations.  The maternity law,
Chapter 218 of the Acts of 1996, requires insurers and HMOs to
provide coverage for a minimum of 48 hours of inpatient hospital
care following a vaginal delivery and 96 hours of care following
a Caesarean delivery.  Any decision to discharge a mother and
her newborn earlier must be made in accordance with the DPH regulations.
 The regulations, which also define post-delivery care, must be
consistent with guidelines established by the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Academy
of Pediatrics (AAP).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica"> <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">While Chapter 218 specifies that decisions
to shorten the length of hospitalization following delivery shall
be made by the attending physician, in consultation with the mother,
the regulations go further.  They require such decisions to be
made by &quot;the attending practitioners for both mother and
infant in consultation with and upon agreement by the mother.&quot;
 MAHMO has argued that such a provision establishes a dangerous
precedent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">The emergency regulations also require
insurers and HMOs to provide a minimum of one home visit to mothers
who are discharged early, if the mother agrees.  The visit must
occur within the first 48 hours following delivery and must be
conducted by a physician, registered nurse, or certified nurse
midwife.  Additional home visits must be provided if deemed necessary
by the attending practitioner.  The home visit shall include the
performance of newborn screening tests.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">In addition, Chapter 218 mandated that
hospitals allow mothers and newborns to be discharged early only
in accordance with DPH regulations.  The emergency regulations
therefore require hospitals to develop protocols governing early
discharge for mothers and infants that are consistent with ACOG/AAP
standards.  Hospitals also must develop written discharge plans
for patients discharged early and develop protocols for the transfer
of clinical information to those providing home care services.
 The regulations also specify that no discharges may take place
between 6:00 P.M. and 9:00 A.M. unless the mother agrees.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">Two public hearings will be held in March
on the emergency regulations,  though no dates have yet been scheduled.
 The department may subsequently amend the regulations before
issuing final ones.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=#000000>McDonough Proposes Health Care Reform Bill
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
On January 11, Health Care Committee co-chair <B>Rep.</B> <B>John
McDonough </B>(D-Jamaica Plain) unveiled legislation that would
modify the Chapter 23 employer mandate and implement portions
of the Weld administration's Medicaid waiver proposal. The bill
replaces the employer mandate with a so-called health care minimum
wage. All employers would be required either to contribute at
least 50 percent of the cost of individual coverage for employees
working a minimum of 20 hours per week or contribute $1200 per
employee annually to a trust fund administered by
the Department of Medical Security (DMS). Employers would not
be subject to the mandate with respect to any employee who obtains
health coverage through another source. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
At a January 16 hearing, MAHMO President Robert Hughes testified
that the bill embodies many of the principles and concepts of
the association's plan for expanding access to health insurance,
entitled<I> Facing Fiscal Reality</I>. For the past five years,
MAHMO has sponsored legislation to enact that plan and has consistently
supported the principle of universal coverage in the context of
a competitive system. Hughes told committee members that MAHMO
had a number of questions and concerns with the bill, especially
regarding the age-old problem of funding and the free care pool.
He stated that MAHMO generally does not support mandates and would
prefer to see the revenue necessary for true universal coverage
raised more fairly by increasing the income tax and alcohol and
cigarette taxes. <BR>

<P>
Unlike the Chapter 23 mandate, the health care minimum wage bill
does not exclude employers with five or fewer employees. Employed
individuals not receiving employer-sponsored coverage may purchase
coverage through DMS. The legislation directs DMS to contract
with carriers or the Division of Medical Assistance (DMA) to provide
this coverage. Enrollees must have the choice of at least two
plans, and no more than 30 percent of enrollees may be covered
by a single carrier. The bill does not specify a minimum level
of coverage employers must offer to avoid the tax, though it does
say that carriers must provide coverage for podiatry services.
Two changes are made to the small group law. First, the law is
expanded to apply to groups of 26-50 employees. Second, the definition
of &quot;eligible employee&quot; is amended to include employees
working at least 20 hours per week. <BR>

<P>
The legislation authorizes DMA to implement the Medicaid waiver
and contains language to allow the programs established under
the waiver to continue if the federal government replaces the
Medicaid program with block grants. The bill's major change to
the waiver is the elimination of the tax credit for employer-sponsored
family coverage; only the $400 credit for individual coverage
remains. The bill retains purchase subsidies for low-income individuals.
The bill diverts funds from the Uncompensated Care Pool to finance
the waiver programs (expanded Medicaid, tax credits, subsidies)
for two years, during which time hospitals are guaranteed to have
their uncompensated care costs reimbursed at the same rate as
in fiscal year 1996. 

<P>
Finally, the bill would raise the commonwealth's cigarette tax
by 25 cents per pack. The proceeds would fund the Children's Medical
Security Plan and a new prescription drug subsidy program for
the elderly. 

<P>
<B><h3>Confidentiality Bill Recalled from Governor's Desk
</h3></B>
<P>
H. 5347, An Act Further Protecting the Confidentiality of Patients,
has been recalled from the governor's desk to allow the governor
and his staff further time to review the legislation. The bill
would require patient authorization for the release of certain
information obtained by a mental health professional during diagnosis
and treatment. The bill also contains a provision prohibiting
HMOs and insurers from refusing to contract with a provider--or
canceling a provider's contract--solely because he or she has
discussed plan benefits with patients.

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="AGaramond">MAHMO has filed seven bills

would allow insurers and HMOs to offer senior citizens more choices

of plans- those with no prescription coverage and those with unlimited
drug coverage.  MAHMO's legislation would allow HMOs to create
plans with varying levels of coverage for prescription drugs,
thereby allowing seniors to choose a plan best suited to their
needs.  These types of products were available and popular prior
to the Division of Insurance's 1993 restrictions on types of products
which could be offered. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U><FONT FACE="AGaramond">An Act Permitting Health Maintenance

would allow HMOs to develop Point-of-Service products.  A Point-of-Service
product (POS) is an HMO that also covers out-of-network services.
 The bill would allow HMOs to voluntarily offer a POS product
under HMO licensure.  For a higher cost, seniors would have the
benefit of being covered for services rendered outside their provider
network and be able to choose from a wider range of providers.

<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="AGaramond">There is an ever-increasing
body of evidence which indicates that the care that seniors receive
in HMOs is  either comparable or superior to that  received in
fee-for-service systems.  Studies on quality of care, patient
satisfaction, and other topics have consistently given high marks
for HMOs in all areas.  However,on October 1, the </FONT><I><FONT FACE="AGaramond">Journal
of the American Medical Association</FONT></I><FONT FACE="AGaramond">
(JAMA) published a study which concluded that chronically ill
elderly and poor patients tend to have worse health outcomes when
treated in HMOs than in traditional fee-for-service systems. 
Yet there are numerous problems with the study that cast its findings
into question.  For example, the study uses data that is six to
eight  years old and does not reflect the current quality of healthcare.
The study focuses only on one &quot;outcome&quot; measure: whether
patients believed their health improved, stayed the same, or worsened.
 It does not look at other measures or medical records; nor does
it include the reports of physicians.  Finally, it surveys only
about 100 Medicare patients per health plan, while the standard
for reliability in such a study is at least 500 patients per health
plan.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond">HMOs are proud of the level of care they
provide to their senior members, including those with chronic
medical conditions.  HMOs are also proud of the contributions
they have made to the Medicare program.  In quality of care studies,
both recent and from the same period of the JAMA study, results
show that Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs are receiving care which
is comparable or better than fee-for-service care.  As of June
1996, HMOs were serving 4.3 million older Americans, and seniors
are choosing to join HMOs at a rate of 80,000 to 100,000 per month.
 Despite the fact that Medicare beneficiaries can choose to leave
an HMO in any month, only 4 percent switch to fee-for-service
annually.  If you have questions about member satisfaction or
the quality of your care, don't hesitate to call your HMO's member
services department.  If you would like a copy of relevant studies,
please call our Public Affairs Coordinator, Mary Ann Preskul-Ricca,
at (617)523-3300, ext. 25.<BR>

who do not qualify for Medicaid and who do not have prescription

will be required.  The law is effective as of July 1, 1997, and
those eligible may enroll from February 1- April 30, 1997.  During

<H3><B><CENTER>Bill to Create Drug Subsidy Program</CENTER></B></H3>
<P>
Among its provisions,An Act to Improve Health Care Access (H. 6195) would dedicate
proceeds from an increase in the commonwealth's cigarette tax
to fund a new prescription drug subsidy program for low-income
seniors.  The program would provide coverage for up to $500 worth
of prescription drugs annually and would require a small co-payment
by beneficiaries.  H. 6195 passed both chambers of the Legislature
by the two-thirds majority needed to override a promised veto
by Governor Weld by the July 31 conclusion of the formal legislative
session.  The health care access bill is sponsored by the co-chairs
of Joint Committee on Health Care, Rep. John McDonough (D-Jamaica
Plain) and Sen. Mark Montigny (D-New Bedford), and backed by a
broad-based coalition that includes MAHMO, AARP, Coastline Elder
Services, Highland Valley Elder Services, Home and Health Care
Association of Massachusetts, Massachusetts Association of Older
Americans, Massachusetts Home Care, Massachusetts Senior Action
Council, and the Older Women's League.

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=#000000 FACE="Helvetica">The open enrollment
period when individuals can sign up for Medicare HMO or Medigap
coverage runs from February 1 through March 31 in Massachusetts.
 While these two months constitute the &quot;official&quot; open
enrollment period, many HMOs allow seniors to join at any time
during the year.  To enroll in a Medicare HMO, you must have Medicare
parts A and B and live in the plan's service area.  All Medicare
supplement insurers and HMOs in Massachusetts must offer a core
plan and a plan that includes prescription drug coverage.  They
may not deny coverage because of preexisting medical conditions,
impose waiting periods for benefits, or charge a premium based
on your age or health.  Two Massachusetts HMOs, Community Health
Plan and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, are awaiting federal approval
of new coverage for Medicare enrollees.  Those HMOs must postpone
new enrollments until this approval is received.  For more information

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=#000000 FACE="Helvetica">In Washington, Congressional
and administration negotiators continue to work to reach an agreement
on a balanced budget plan.  At least five proposals are now under
discussion, each calling for reductions in the growth of Medicare
spending.  President Clinton's latest proposal seeks to trim Medicare
by $124 billion over seven years.  The Republican leadership has
backed off its original call for $270 billion in spending cuts
over seven years and is now seeking $168 billion.  Similar reductions
in Medicare spending are contained in proposals offered by House
Republicans, conservative Democrats, and Senate moderates.  While
negotiators have not yet focused their attention on Medicare policy
reforms, many observers believe any budget agreement will include
a majority of the reforms included in the bill passed by Congress
last year and later vetoed by President Clinton.  That bill sought
to expand the health insurance options of seniors by enabling
them to enroll in several types of managed care plans.  It also
designated a single open enrollment period, imposed some restrictions on changing coverage
during the year, created incentives for Medicare beneficiaries
to establish medical savings accounts, and increased monthly premiums
for Medicare part B.<BR>

<B>Medicare Reform Update</B> 
<P>
On December 6, President Clinton vetoed a Congressional conference
committee budget bill that included a $270 billion reduction in
the growth of Medicare spending over the next seven years. Despite
the president's veto, the bill is expected to serve as the basis
of negotiations on Medicare reform.
<P>
The conference committee bill seeks to bring the rate of Medicare
spending growth in line with inflation, ending the double-digit
increases that threatened to bankrupt the program. The bill also
calls for expanding health insurance options for seniors. Medicare
beneficiaries would continue to be able to choose coverage under
the traditional fee-for-service system or in an HMO. In addition,
they could enroll in a PPO (preferred provider organization),
a PSO (provider sponsored organization), or could instead establish
a medical savings account in conjunction with catastrophic health
insurance coverage. Under the Congressional proposal, all managed
health care plans--HMOs, PPOs, and PSOs--would be known as MedicarePlus
plans.
<P>
Seniors already enrolled in HMOs could expect to see only a few
significant changes under Medicare reform. The bill would create
a single annual open enrollment period, whereas many HMOs currently
allow Medicare beneficiaries to enroll at any time. The bill also
would impose some restrictions on changing coverage during the
year. Currently, most Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs
can enroll in another HMO or switch to fee-for-service coverage
at any point during the year. It is also expected that, under
any budget agreement, seniors would see an increase in their monthly
premiums for Medicare part B, which pays the cost of physician
care and other types of medical services.
<P>
While the HMO industry has expressed concern with certain portions
of the conference committee legislation, the industry supports
offering Medicare beneficiaries health care choices comparable
to those available to Americans under age 65.
<P>
A final budget agreement is expected by the end of this year.
MAHMO plans to provide a more detailed explanation of the Medicare
reforms contained in that agreement in the next edition of <I>Outlook:
New &amp; Views for Seniors</I>.

<H3><B>Medicare Reform: The HMO Position</B></H3>

<P>
Congressional debate over Medicare reform is expected to continue
throughout the fall. The Group Health Association of America (GHAA),
the nationwide association for HMOs, is urging lawmakers to strengthen
and modernize Medicare to preserve the program for future generations.
On July 26, GHAA issued a blueprint for reform entitled <I>Medicare
at 30: An Opportunity for All Americans</I>. GHAA sent a copy
of this document to every member of Congress. Massachusetts HMOs
have been working with GHAA to support the reforms outlined in
this plan. What follows is a brief look at the HMO proposal.
<P>
<B>The Need for Reform</B> 
<P>
This year's annual Medicare trustees report warned that, without
Congressional action, the long-term future of Medicare is in jeopardy.
The trustees expressed great concern over current and anticipated
growth in Medicare costs, which they predicted would drain the
Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, or Medicare Part A, by
2002. Trustees also warned that high spending growth in the Supplementary
Medical Insurance Trust Fund, or Medicare Part B, which is funded
through monthly enrollee premiums and general revenues, would
exacerbate the federal budget deficit. The trustees further warned
that the impending retirement of the baby-boom generation looms
as a further strain on Medicare.
<P>
While the health care industry in general has changed dramatically
in the 30 years since Medicare was created, Medicare itself has
not kept pace. For example, more than half of working Massachusetts
residents today belongs to an HMO, compared with only 10 percent
of Medicare beneficiaries. In study after study, moreover, HMO
members are found to be substantially more satisfied with their
care and coverage than those with old-style fee-for-service insurance.
And while the premium for the average HMO member is projected
to decrease 1.3 percent this year, the Congressional Budget Office
says Medicare costs will increase about 10 percent per year for
the rest of the decade. HMOs believe we can strengthen and modernize
Medicare by offering beneficiaries the same choices available
to people under 65.
<P>
<B>The HMO Plan</B> 
<P>
<B>1. Protect Beneficiaries by Finding Long-Term Solutions.</B>
If budgetary pressures result in short-term &quot;fixes&quot;--such
as arbitrary reductions in payments to health care providers,
limits on coverage, and increases in premiums and co-payments--Medicare
beneficiaries will be the ultimate losers. The long-term health
of the Medicare program should be protected--and Medicare spending
brought into line with private sector health spending--by creating
a stable, predictable environment in which health plans can provide
beneficiaries with the widest possible range of coverage options
offering high-quality, accountable, cost-effective health care.
<P>
<B>2. Offer Medicare Beneficiaries More Choice. </B>Medicare modernization
requires offering beneficiaries health care choices comparable
to those available to Americans under age 65. Beneficiaries should
be able to choose from an expanded range of options, including
coordinated care plans (HMOs, Preferred Provider Organizations,
Point of Service plans, etc.) as well as fee-for-service Medicare
coverage, and should have the opportunity to change options periodically.
<P>
<B>3. Offer Medicare Beneficiaries More Information.</B> Beneficiaries
and prospective beneficiaries should receive educational information
about the basic characteristics of the health care choices available
to them. This will allow them to compare all available options
in order to choose the one that best meets their needs.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="chart.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><HR>
</CENTER>
<p>
<B>4. Promote Quality and Accountability As Well As Cost-Effectiveness.</B>
All options offered to Medicare beneficiaries should be required
to meet comparable standards governing quality of care, access
to care, grievance procedures, and solvency. All providers serving
Medicare beneficiaries should be accountable for their performance
in providing services and should submit periodic reports based
on comparable measures of quality.
<P>
<B>5. Protect Beneficiaries by Improving Medicare Administration.</B>
Medicare can and should reduce the time required to process and
approve applications from plans to serve Medicare beneficiaries
and/or to expand service areas, and minimize regional variations
in policy interpretation and administrative determinations.
<P>
<B>6. Promote Choice by Compensating Health Plans Appropriately.
</B>Medicare should replace its arbitrary and complicated formula
for compensating health plans. GHAA has proposed a simpler, fairer,
more predictable approach that would expand high-quality, cost-effective
options for Medicare beneficiaries.
<P>

at 30, please call call Mary Ann Preskul-Ricca at the Massachusetts
Association of HMOs at 617-523-3300 extension 25 or send E-mail

<H3><B>Seniors to Pay More for Medex Plans
</h3></B>
<P>
The Division of Insurance announced July 17 that it will allow
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts a 15.6% rate increase
for its Medex Gold Plan and a 27.4% increase for its Medex Standard
Plan.  The Division originally gave Blue Cross only a 4.1% increase
for Medex Gold and sought a 6.4% rate cut for Medex Standard.
 Following a successful court challenge by Blue Cross, the Division
was ordered to reconsider its rate decisions for the two Medicare
supplement products.  The rate hikes reveal once more the failure
of the 1993 Medigap reform law to hold down Medex rates.  For
1995, Medex Gold premiums will rise to $174.47 a month, while
Medex Standard will now cost $133.21 a month.  Because the rate
increase is retroactive to January 8, seniors will be billed in
installments for the retroactive portion of the increase.
<P>
The Medex rate hikes undoubtedly will encourage many senior citizens
to explore other health insurance options such as HMOs.  A growing
number of Massachusetts HMOs offer senior health plans, both with
and without prescription drug benefits, that provide more comprehensive
benefits at a lower cost than traditional Medigap policies.  Because
many seniors want as much information as possible before deciding
to change health plans, MAHMO would be happy to serve as a resource.
 We can provide answers to your questions about HMOs and direct
you to plans in your area offering coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.
 In addition, seniors are encouraged to attend one or more of
the many open houses hosted by HMOs, where plan staff can answer
specific questions about benefits, premiums, and enrollment periods.
 Finally, seniors can obtain more information by calling the state
Office of Elder Affairs SHINE Counseling Program, at 1-800-882-2003.
<P>
<H3><B>Studies Find Seniors Satisfied With HMOs
</h3></B>

<P>
Several recent studies confirm that, in general, Medicare beneficiaries
who belong to HMOs are satisfied with their service and care.
 A study conducted this spring for the Kaiser Family Foundation
examined the experiences and attitudes of Medicare beneficiaries
in HMOs and traditional fee-for-service plans, as well as the
attitudes of consumers who soon will be eligible for Medicare.
 HMO Medicare beneficiaries reported they are pleased with their
physicians and with the quality of care, cost, and convenience
of their HMOs.  
<P>
They also said their primary care doctors refer them to specialists
with ease, they are highly satisfied with the level of benefits
they receive, and they find the lack of paperwork, low cost of
coverage, and prescription drug coverage important advantages
of their HMO coverage.  Finally, HMO members generally said they
would recommend their health plans to friends
<P>
In addition, the Group Health Association of America (GHAA)  reported
in June that only 4% of Medicare beneficiaries who receive care
through an HMO choose to return to old-style, fee-for-service
Medicare.  GHAA researchers analyzed 1994 data collected by the
Health Care Financing Administration, the federal agency that
oversees Medicare.  Their findings are particularly significant
given that Medicare beneficiaries are eligible to switch health
plans each month.

<H3><B>What is Outlook?</B></H3>

<P>
Welcome to the first edition of Outlook: News and Views, a publication
of the Massachusetts Association of HMOs (MAHMO).   Every other
month, Outlook will bring you coverage of HMO industry issues
and events, as they affect Bay State senior citizens.  We'll report
on legislative and policy developments on Beacon Hill, keep you
updated on Medicare issues, tell you how some Massachusetts seniors
are working to promote managed care in the Commonwealth, and provide
you with reports on MAHMO activities.  If you have suggestions
about the kinds of stories you'd like to see here, please let
us know.  We welcome your input.
<H3><B>What is MAHMO?</B></H3>

<P>
The Massachusetts Association of HMOs (MAHMO) is an active trade
association representing nineteen health maintenance organizations
in the Commonwealth. MAHMO's primary mission is to improve public
understanding of HMOs and represent the interests of its member
health plans.  From its incorporation in 1982, and with its first
staffing in 1986, MAHMO has worked to promote economic and public
policy conducive to the understanding and growth of HMOs.  The
Association supports accessible, affordable, and universal coverage
within a market-based, consumer-driven competitive health care
system.  Today, MAHMO is organized into three functional areas:
legislative advocacy, research and public policy analysis, and
communications.

At an April 10 hearing before the Joint Committee on Insurance,
the American Association of Retired Persons' Elizabeth Campbell
testified in opposition to seven so-called &quot;any-willing-provider&quot;
bills the committee is currently considering.  Campbell told committee
members that these bills would &quot;undermine the foundation
of health care reform.&quot;  The AARP joined MAHMO and a host
of organizations in opposing any willing provider legislation,
which would force HMOs to contract with any doctor or other health
care provider.  By preventing HMOs from forming select networks
of health care professionals, any willing provider laws would
weaken the ability of plans to ensure the quality of care their
members receive and hold down health costs .  Speaking on behalf
of Massachusetts' 832,000 AARP members, Campbell said: &quot;we
view managed care as just about the only health care reform we
have that is working.&quot;

<P>
HMOs offer senior citizens more comprehensive benefits at a lower
cost than regular Medicare supplemental coverage.  More than 80,000
Massachusetts seniors now receive their health care through an
HMO.  Because so many seniors don't think they know enough about
HMOs, MAHMO would be happy to answer your questions.  Please feel
free to call us at 617-523-3300.

<H1><B>Frequently Asked Questions about HMO Senior Plans </B>
</H1>
<HR>

<P>
Everywhere you turn these days, seniors are asking about HMO Medicare
options. Because many seniors don't think they know enough about
HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations), this article answers
some of the most common questions about HMOs, to help you decide
whether an HMO is the right choice for you.
<P>
HMOs offer more extensive health insurance coverage than Medicare
provides, and some do this without charging any premium. If you
are used to paying a high monthly premium for Medex or some other
traditional Medicare supplement plan, a free HMO senior plan may
seem too good to be true. It's not, and here's why.
<H4><B>MEDICARE </B></H4>

<P>
Medicare, like all traditional health insurance, is a &quot;fee-for-service&quot;
system. Every time you use a service that Medicare covers, it
pays the person who does the service a fee. In a fee-for-service
system, every time these health care professionals provide services,
they get another fee, so costs can zoom out of control. And while
this system pays for lots of &quot;pounds of cure,&quot; it does
not usually pay for, or even encourage, many &quot;ounces of prevention.&quot;
Even worse, nobody monitors or coordinates the people who provide
your care. Very often, patients get many treatments or prescriptions
from a variety of specialists, each without any knowledge of what
the other specialists are doing or planning to do. And no one
doctor evaluates these specialists to make sure you get the best
care, or that your various specialists have the most appropriate
tools and knowledge, and get the best results.
<H4><B>HMOs</B> </H4>

<P>
Health Maintenance Organizations are meant to be different from
traditional health insurance. Rather than sending a new bill to
Medicare each time a service is provided, an HMO gets paid a fixed
budget to keep you healthy and treat you when you get sick. If
you aren't charged a premium, it is because the fixed budget paid
to the HMO by Medicare already covers all the expected cost of
your coverage. Having a fixed budget means that HMOs won't want
to give you unnecessary treatments, but will want to give you
preventive services -- like blood pressure tests, cholesterol
tests, cancer screenings, and annual physicals -- and will want
to see you early if you get sick. It also means that each HMO
has a team (which HMOs call a &quot;network&quot;) of health care
professionals who all have to work together.
<H4><B>HMO NETWORKS</B> </H4>

<P>
Each HMO competes to assemble the best possible network. Like
assembling any professional team, this involves a lot of careful
screening, training, recruiting, and negotiating. Overall, this
means HMO doctors and other professionals tend to have better
credentials than their peers. Nationally, approximately 85 percent
of HMO doctors, but only about 65 percent of all doctors, are
certified by their specialty boards. HMOs are now undergoing accreditation
by the National Committee on Quality Assurance, another assurance
that an HMO will deliver high quality care. Many HMOs also produce
&quot;report cards&quot; to show how well they do at keeping their
members healthy. And Medicare also monitors HMOs closely to be
sure their seniors receive appropriate care.
<H4><B>PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS </B></H4>

<P>
In an HMO, the leader of the team that treats you is your &quot;primary
care physician.&quot; New HMO members are asked to choose their
primary care physician. He or she is responsible for determining
when, where, and how you ought to receive various medical services.
Sometimes, people who are used to making all of these decisions
themselves don't like this system. While an HMO cannot offer you
a health care team without a leader, it will let you choose another
primary care physician if the one you have is not to your liking.
Every HMO also has a grievance resolution system, so that, if
you have a problem with any aspect of your health care, you can
get a quick resolution.
<P>
Your primary care physician can only coordinate your care effectively
if your other specialists are part of your HMO's team. This means
he or she won't refer you to a specialist or facility which is
not part of your HMO's network. Therefore, if you believe you
will need to use a particular specialist or facility, make sure
it is part of the HMO's network <B>before</B> you join that HMO.
<P>
Although people who don't belong to an HMO may suspect that HMOs
provide less services than they should -- because the HMOs don't
get paid more for providing more services -- this is not the experience
of HMO members. HMOs are proving, in study after study, that their
members' health results are better than those for people covered
by traditional health insurance. And, overall, HMO members are
much more satisfied with their coverage than are fee-for-service
customers. According to a recent survey, 79% of Massachusetts
HMO members would recommend their health plan to a friend, compared
to 69% of people with fee-for-service coverage.
<H4><B>JOINING AN HMO </B></H4>

<P>
You can join an HMO when you first enroll in Medicare, or during
an open enrollment period (every year, from January through March).
You may only enroll in an HMO if you live in its &quot;service
area,&quot; which is the geographic area where the HMO has a network
of health care professionals. While you are enrolled in an HMO,
Medicare won't ordinarily pay for treatments that your primary
care physician has not authorized. Of course, there are exceptions,
such as if you are away from home and need emergency care. However,
someone who expects to be outside an HMO's service area more than
three months a year would probably not want to enroll in that
HMO.
<P>
HMOs are extremely popular in Massachusetts -- almost <U>four
of every ten</U> Massachusetts residents belongs to an HMO, the
highest proportion in the nation. Chances are, as a Medicare beneficiary,
there are several HMOs available to you.

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To the Editor:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In a December 9 editorial, the <I>Globe</I> says
that the Legislature has reformed the state's uncompensated care
pool four times in eleven years, then proceeds to call for yet
another fix (&quot;Not-really-free,&quot; December 9).  It's time
to stop tinkering with the pool.  It is an antique which  should
be replaced with a program that provides relief to individuals,
not institutions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Hospitals are not facing an immediate financial crisis.
 Indeed, the industry continues to show healthy profit margins.
If there is a problem, it is one of excessive capital debt and
empty, unused beds.  To blame free care is simplistic and misleading.
 But, shaping a solution now to the real problem will avert a
future crisis that could be all too real.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The real problem is the hundreds of thousands of
uninsured individuals who have no access  to medical care but
through hospital emergency rooms.   Our proposed legislation will
extend health insurance to the majority of these individuals,
allowing them to receive care in appropriate, cost effective settings.
  Our plan is funded by a two percent tax on the revenues of most
health care providers, assuring that all purchasers, including
the self-insured, contribute.  It addresses the real problem of
the uninsured.   And, it uses the money we now pour into the pool
to buy a long-term, financially effective solution.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There is no wide spread clamoring to adopt the hospital
industry's as yet unseen proposal. There is a clamoring for expanded
health insurance coverage.  Let's invest in the option with the
best odds of giving a good return on our dollars instead of throwing
more money at a mechanism which does not work and does not address
the core problem.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>To the Editor:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Robert Kuttner breaks no new ground in his rambling
inventory of HMO 'sins.' (&quot;Managed-care malpractice,&quot;
November 25).  We feel compelled to address a few of his points,
however.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>First, HMOs do not practice medicine, nor do HMO
coverage decisions constitute medical decisions.  As a result,
HMOs cannot be held liable for malpractice.   Consumers do have
recourse under the general negligence law if an HMO is negligent
in its actions so as to cause harm.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Second, Kuttner dismisses the ongoing quest for more
sophisticated measurement, collection, and reporting of data on
the quality of care in HMOs.  He fails to recognize that this
data-which cannot be collected from traditional insurers--not
only benefits consumers, but also helps HMOs focus on areas where
they can improve their performance. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Third, Kuttner's national forum prevents him from
acknowledging that Massachusetts HMOs routinely score among the
best health plans in the nation in rankings of quality and member
satisfaction.  Massachusetts HMOs have been pioneers in the way
medical care is provided.  We have a healthy and competitive HMO
market in the commonwealth, and this competition is keeping prices
low and driving improvements in quality and customer service.
 Consumers ought to be concerned that the &quot;new wave&quot;
of regulation Kuttner calls for may undermine the innovation and
competition from which they are benefiting.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Kuttner continues to try to create a sense of crisis
in the existing health care marketplace in order to advance his
own vision: a government-run, single-payor bureacracy.  How consumer-friendly
and cost-effective would that system be?<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Ellen Goodman's column on outpatient mastectomies
does not reflect the reality of how women recovering from breast
cancer surgery are cared for in Massachusetts HMOs (&quot;Is this
any way to run a health care system?&quot; November 17).  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Our health plans do not maintain fixed policies regarding
the length of time a woman is hospitalized following breast cancer
surgery.  Instead, the length of hospitalization and other aspects
of a woman's treatment plan depend on her individual needs and
her doctor's recommendations.  Our physicians-in consultation
with their patients-make decisions about when it is appropriate
for women to return home following surgery.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In Massachusetts HMOs, doctors and their patients
work together prior to breast cancer surgery to determine a post-surgery
treatment plan.  Decisions about the most appropriate setting
for recovery and follow-up care are based on a variety of factors,
including a woman's age and overall health, advancement of the
disease, type of surgery, and home support environment.  Any complications
following surgery also affect the treatment plan.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Massachusetts HMOs are proud of their record in the
early detection and treatment of breast cancer.  HMOs provide
extensive education about breast self-examinations and encourage
and pay for regular mammograms in keeping with their focus on
preventive and comprehensive care.<BR>

To the editor: <BR>

<P>
Suzanne Gordon offers a distorted view of the impact of managed
care on medical research (&quot;Is research being 'managed' out
of existence?, October 13).  <BR>

<P>
Gordon's underlying premise seems to be that all medical research
should be funded, regardless of its benefit.  She fails to acknowledge,
however, that managed care does in fact strongly support medical
research but looks for accountability in its outcomes.  For example,
the <I>Health Affairs</I> article she briefly cites shows that
managed care has not deterred research at academic medical centers,
though it may be redirecting resources toward the treatment of
common conditions and away from the rare diseases which medical
school faculty have concentrated on historically.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>BOSTON-Seven Massachusetts HMOs rate among the best
health plans nationally for preventive care, according to a survey
contained in this week's issue of <A HREF=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/nycu/hmohigh.htm><I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I></A>.
The 7 HMOs made the magazine's &quot;Honor Roll,&quot; which
included 21 health plans that garnered four stars for high standards
in preventive care.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>U.S. News</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> based its survey
on data provided by 151 HMOs to the <a href=http://www.ncqa.org/> National Committee for Quality
Assurance (NCQA)</a>, an independent HMO accrediting organization.
 Last week, NCQA released a major database containing information
on the quality of HMO care.  That database, called Quality Compass,
compared health plans across the country on a series of preventive
care measures.  It showed that New England HMOs scored better
than the national average on most measures.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>U.S. News</I> survey and the NCQA findings
follow two similar studies published recently that showed Massachusetts
HMOs to be among the nation's best.  The June 24 issue of <I>Newsweek
</I>contained results of a survey rating 43 of the largest HMOs
in the country.  The survey was done in conjunction with the Foundation
for Accountability, a respected national coalition of large employers
working to find better ways of measuring the quality of health
care.  Six Massachusetts HMOs were included in the survey, and
all six achieved either &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;very good&quot;
overall scores.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In addition, the August issue of <I>Consumer Reports</I>
rated 51 HMOs according to overall member satisfaction.  Three
Massachusetts HMOs scored among the top 4 health plans in the
survey.  The ratings were based on more than 20,000 responses
to a questionnaire distributed to the magazine's subscribers.

Letters To The Editor
<P>
The Boston Globe
<P>
P.O. Box 2378
<P>
Boston, MA 02107-2378
<P>
The August 1 Op Ed by Suzanne Gordon and Timothy McCall represents
one of the best examples of cut and paste HMO bashing I have seen
. . .take one allegation from this source, add a snippet of an
accusation from another, glue it all together with political animus
and pretend an original has been created.
<P>
Unfortunately, what really was created was another factually deficient,
clearly biased, and often erroneous diatribe.  Can we let some
facts get in the way of their pro-single payor advocacy, the real
agenda behind their anti-HMO position?
<P>
There is no evidence that the &quot;norm&quot; among HMOs is to
&quot;hide&quot; reimbursement methods from patients.  In Massachusetts,
there never were so-called &quot;gag&quot; clauses and, with industry
support, the legislature took action to assure there never will
be. Far from being &quot;almost impossible&quot;  for patients
to find out how their physicians are paid, it is easy.  All they
have to do is ask their doctor.
<P>
The federal rules changes referenced did not, as implied, impose
a general disclosure requirement on HMOs, but only called for
certain information to go to the Health Care Financing Administration
to assure that HMOs adequately protect their Plan physicians against
high financial risks. 
<P>
The assertion attributed to The New England Journal on US Healthcare
risk levels in fact came from an Editorial authored by Drs. Steffie
Woolhandler and David Himmelstein, two well-known advocates for
the Canadian-style single payer system who also advance that agenda
through excessive and exaggerated fault-finding with our current
consumer choice system.  
<P>
The same Edition's Special Article section, however, featured
a study by Marsha R. Gold, Sc.D., et al documenting an extensive
array of factors which determine HMO physician reimbursement rates,
including patient satisfaction levels, care quality, and adherence
to professional practice guidelines.
<P>
Far from being paid more to give less care, HMO physicians are
encouraged to provide appropriate care, including the preventive
services that keep people healthy and limit illness severity and
which, incidentally, are often unpaid for in indemnity insurance
plans.  Are specialists used less frequently? Are hospital stays
shortened or avoided?  Most likely.  Because the HMO emphasis
is on primary, preventive services and the appropriate use of
medical resources, an emphasis which favors the family practitioner
over the specialists of all stripes.
<P>
Patient satisfaction surveys as well as quality of care studies
repeatedly show that HMOs are giving good care and keeping patients
healthy and happy.  Why, then, does the bashing continue?  Because
those who want single-payor need a justification for forcing political
change. They need a current system that is seen as being  &quot;in
crisis.&quot;  It is both that simple and that complex.
<P>
     Sincerely,
<P>
     Robert L. Hughes
<P>
     President

   <title>The Landscape for HMOs </title>
   <meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/2.01Gold (Win32)">
</head>

<BODY background="blue_pap.gif" bgcolor="#e6e8fa">

<IMG SRC="mahmo.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">

<center><p><b><font SIZE=+2>The Landscape for HMOs: A Perspective on 1996</font></b></p></center>

<p><font SIZE=-1>More than 40 million Americans now belong to health maintenance
organizations. That number includes 2.3 million Massachusetts residents.
Among all states, Massachusetts continues to have one of the highest percentages
of its citizens enrolled in HMOs. Nearly 40 percent of all Bay State residents
are HMO members. </font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=-1>In 1996, HMOs should continue their progress toward becoming
the standard in health care delivery. As they do, they will face continued
pressure to keep premiums affordable, demonstrate the quality of their
care, and work closely with government to implement sensible health policy
reforms.
<br>&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=-1>Here's a look at a few of the coming year's likely developments:</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=-1><b>Stable premiums : </b>A report issued this time last
year by benefits consultant Foster Higgins showed a 1.1 percent decrease
in the cost to business of providing health insurance to employees. The
study attributed the drop to the growing number of workers enrolled in
HMOs and other types of managed care organizations. In 1995, Massachusetts
HMO members paid, on average, the same premiums they paid the year before.
The same should hold true, generally, in 1996. In fact, the Massachusetts
Health Care Purchasers Group, a statewide business coalition, has issued
a challenge to HMOs and insurers to reduce premiums by 3 percent in the
coming year. Look for employer health care costs to remain low nationally,
as well.</font>
<br></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=-1></font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE=-1><b>A continued focus on quality: </b>Business groups,
such as the New England HEDIS coalition, have taken the lead in the search
for effective ways of measuring and comparing the quality of care provided
by HMOs and traditional insurers. The newly-formed Foundation for Accountability,
a coalition of <font COLOR="#000000">major health care purchasers from
across the nation, has emerged at the forefront of this movement. The group
includes GTE Corporation, 3M Corporation, American Express Company, Ameritech,
Pepsico, and the Health Care Financing Administration, which manages Medicare
and Medicaid. Together, foundation members purchase health benefits for
more than 80 million people, making the group the largest of its kind by
far. Expect to hear more from them in 1996.</font></font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=-1><b>Nongroup insurance reform:</b> While most Massachusetts
residents are insured through an employer's group health benefits plan,
a significant number of workers do not have access to health insurance
through their employer. Many work for small companies that cannot afford
to offer coverage. As a result, their health insurance options are limited,
principally because of the lack of affordable individual--or nongroup--insurance
coverage. </font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=-1>Massachusetts HMOs have consistently supported legislation
to expand access to health insurance by reforming the nongroup market.
In October, the legislature's Insurance Committee approved a major nongroup
reform bill. As drafted, the legislation presents several problems. It
would</font><font COLOR="#000000"> <font SIZE=-1>make nongroup insurance
more costly for consumers and small businesses. It also would preserve
preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods, discourage employers
from offering health benefits because it makes nongroup coverage more attractive
than small group, and require the Division of Insurance to regulate every
insurer's nongroup premium rates.</font> </font><font SIZE=-1>HMOs, joined
by the Massachusetts Businessman's Association and others, are currently
working with state lawmakers to improve the bill. An amended version of
the legislation could be taken up early in 1996.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=-1><b>Any willing provider mandates: </b>In Washington and
on Beacon Hill, special interest groups from the medical professions will
likely continue their attempts to enact so-called &quot;any willing provider&quot;
legislation. Any willing provider laws would force HMOs to pay for services
from any health care provider who agreed to accept a plan's terms, even
if the provider did not belong to a plan's network. By requiring HMOs to
do business with all comers, such mandates would undermine HMO networks--the
very feature that allows them to assure quality and control costs. The
Massachusetts business community has provided forceful opposition to any
willing provider legislation and can be counted on to do so in 1996. Last
year's State House hearing on the issue brought forth a broad-based opposition
from a coalition that included Associated Industries of Massachusetts,
the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, and the Small Business Service
Bureau.</font>
<br></p>

<p><font SIZE=-1>Finally, we will likely see higher HMO enrollment among
Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 1996, as the federal government
implements major reform. The state Legislature may take action on the Weld
administration's health reform plan, which calls for using tax credits
and direct subsidies to help low income workers and their employers purchase
health insurance. Finally, we may--once and for all-- see a repeal of the
much-deferred employer 1988 employer mandate, currently scheduled to take
effect in August.</font> </p>

</h3>
</B></CENTER>

<CENTER>Massachusetts Association of HMOs<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
The independent pharmacists are at it again.  If you visited one
of their pharmacies last Wednesday, you may have noticed the dim
lighting and  covered windows --all part of a nationwide publicity
stunt orchestrated by the National Association of Retail Druggists.
<p>
<p>
What's their beef this time?  The pharmacists are once again complaining
about low reimbursement rates from HMOs.  Yes, these are the very
same pharmacists who last year told their customers and state
legislators they could meet any price during their campaign for
a law that seeks to protect them from having to compete for HMO
contracts.  How are we to believe them now?
<p>
<p>
HMOs try to make sure their members get the best care at the best
prices. Some HMOs operate their own pharmacies. Others contract
with chain pharmacies or reach an agreement with a network of
independent outlets.  By offering these network pharmacies a guaranteed
volume of business, HMOs secure lower prices to pass along to
employers and subscribers.  For example, senior citizens in HMOs
receive full prescription drug benefits at a cost substantially
lower than traditional Medicare supplemental coverage.
<p>
<p>
Open competition is the key to controlling health care costs.
Independent pharmacies are locked in competition with larger stores.
 Larger stores offer state-of-the art data systems to ensure quality
and cost control, 24-hour emergency access and the ability to
locate virtually any available drug.  Pharmacy chains also offer
discounts to health plans based on the large volume of business
the plans provide.
<p><p>
The pharmacy business is a highly competitive one, but instead
of braving open competition, some independent pharmacies have
sought--and continue to seek-- protectionist legislation.  If
independent pharmacists want to survive in today's environment,
they must take three steps.
<p><p>
First, they must organize into networks.  Computers and other
state-of-the art technology are a start, but pharmacists must
also learn to operate in a way that permits them to take advantage
of cost-based discounts they can obtain from drug manufacturers.
A retail drug chain or pharmacy purchasing cooperative, which
purchases in quantity and has efficiencies of distribution and
billing, can get lower prices from manufacturers.  There is nothing
to prevent an organized network of independent pharmacists from
obtaining these same discounts if it offers these same efficiencies.
<p>
<p>
Second, they must develop a proper business demeanor.  Staging
publicity stunts such as their recent protest is not a recommended
method for the establishment of solid business relationships.
<p>
<p>
Third, they must break the habit of running to the Legislature
for a &quot;quick fix.&quot;  Competition in health care is healthy,
and it is here to stay.  The independent pharmacists would be
much better off putting their time, energy and money into figuring
out how to operate in this new competitive environment.
<p>
<p>
HMOs are becoming increasingly attractive to consumers.  Today,
more than one in three Massachusetts residents belongs to an HMO.
 If the independents offered a better deal--guaranteeing higher
quality, better service, and lower prices--wouldn't HMOs be silly
not to embrace it?
<p>
<p>
Independent pharmacists have an important problem to solve.  They
must figure out how to compete in the modern marketplace. If they
would put as much effort into figuring out how to be competitive
as they do into complaining, they wouldn't feel the need for further
restrictive legislation, either here or nationally.

            functions need to properly satisfy the customer.
            Sales-personnel are then assigned a group of
            customers and trained on the company's service plan.
            They participate in production of sales materials,
            contribute to crop planning, pricing, and policy
            decisions. First class customer service and careful
            follow-through keep our customers satisfied and
            coming back.</p>

        <h3>Greenhouse Grower</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>There are several levels of area and crop
            responsibility available to greenhouse growers
            depending on experience, knowledge, and performance.
            Growers take full control of area and/or crop
            cultural event management from production through
            pulling, including crop documentation. Growing trials
            are encouraged, as we are always looking for
            improvements. The use of mechanization is a must.
            Growers contribute to planning what crops will be
            produced and how many, as well as what resources will
            best be allocated for what crops. We are always
            looking for least toxic and/or more organic methods
            of production. We use a priority system as a decision
            making tool and give consistent support to the
            company goals which we refer to often to help us keep
            properly focused.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Production Supervisor</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Almost all our production and soil making is under
            the production supervisor. This position requires a
            thorough understanding of substrate physics and
            chemistry, crop schedules, space management,
            production equipment use and maintenance, seasonal
            priorities, employee supervision, motivation and
            growth. Keeping up on technical developments is a
            must in this fast paced position.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Greenhouse Service Technician</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Today greenhouse growing involves the use of a lot
            of specialized equipment that must be maintained and
            improved on a continuing basis. This requires a
            working knowledge of growing, electricity,
            electronics, boilers, irrigation, drainage, glazing,
            surveying, water chemistry, welding, carpentry,
            equipment operation, construction, supervision, and
            planning.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Delivery Drivers</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The last person the customer contacts is often the
            delivery driver. This person &quot;is&quot; the
            company to the customer. They are expected to be able
            to identify all the plants and represent themselves
            and the rest of us in a professional manner, that we
            can all be proud of. They are a key link in who we
            are and define our capability at satisfying the
            customer as much as anyone on the team.</p>

                with the first application for the year when the
                grass begins to green. Use a balanced slow
                release fertilizer such as the North Haven
                21-7-14 or a natural organic fertilizer such as
                Texas Tee derived from various types of meals
                such as feather meal, bone meal, fish meal and
                blood meal, to attain healthy roots and

                Super Plus or Hasta Gro. This will encourage root
                production which in turn will intensify the

            <li><p align="left">Mulch flower beds as thick as
                possible using hardwood mulches or pine bark

                excellent summer weed control. </p>

        <p align="left"><strong>July:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p align="left">Continue keeping plants moist to
                prevent wilting and stress on your plants. Stress
                invites pests and diseases to cause further
                problems for the landscape. </p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Plant summer flowers such as
                lantana and periwinkles to continue the intensity

            </li>

            </li>
            <li><p align="left">The second application of
                Pre-emergent can be applied to ensure weed seed
                from germinating. Second application of
                fertilizer can now be applied. </p>
            </li>

        <p align="left"><strong>August:</strong></p>
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <li><p align="left">The final necessary applications
                of the Pre-emergent must be made late in the
                month to deep cool season weeds from popping up
                in the fall and winter. </p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Continue planting perennial
                plants which will provide moderate color up until

            </li>
            <li><p align="left">The use of bone meal is vital for
                quick root growth which in turn increases the

        <ul>

            <li><p align="left">Cut back perennials as they begin

<h2 align="center">Building a Compost Pile</h2>

<p align="center">Building a compost pile is not an exact
process. <br>
For best results, follow Nature's method:</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><em><strong>&quot;Pile it up and
let it rot&quot;</strong></em></font></p>

<p align="center">A compost pile can be started anytime of the
year.<br>
Find a corner of your yard where you have at least 25 sq. ft. of
space. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>Basic guidelines for starting a compost
pile:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li><p align="left">Pile waste material such as twigs
                and wood chips, grass clippings, fallen leaves,
                wood ashes, kitchen scraps (no meat, oil or
                grease), shredded newspapers, pet and human hair,
                lint and sweepings, sawdust, manure (cow &amp;
                horse), weeds &amp; garden residue. Avoid human,
                dog, cat, and bird manure, heavy cardboard,
                diseased plants, oil, pesticide treated wastes. </p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Every foot or so of organic
                material add a layer of organic fertilizer such
                as cottonseed meal and a layer of good garden
                soil or finished compost. Other good enrichment
                materials you could use are blood meal, bone
                meal, rock phosphate, alfalfa meal, and
                greensand. </p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Moisten each layer of material. </p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Pile should be 4' - 5' high. If
                turned weekly, you could have useable compost in
                one month. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

<h2 align="center">Herbs for the Garden</h2>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">Growing herbs is easy and rewarding! Most
        herbs are not bothered by pests or diseases. Herbs can
        fit into a formal or naturalistic garden. Prepare the
        soil for a herb garden by adding compost and raising the
        bed. Most herbs will thrive with a yearly application of
        a granular fertilizer in spring and one supplemental
        fertilizer application in summer. Many herbs are well
        suited to container growing.</p>
        <h3 align="left"><em><strong>A Culinary Garden</strong></em></h3>
        <p align="left">A small, sunny spot in your garden will
        yield plenty of herb trimmings to add to your meals.
        Start with these easy favorites and add more if there is
        room. Plant close to the kitchen for easy use!</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong></strong></em>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>Perennial Herbs</strong></em></p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Chives.</strong> Low growing with
        round clusters of purple flowers; very easy to grow and
        pretty, too.<br>
        <strong>Greek Oregano.</strong> A must for Italian
        cooking; can spread so give it some room; easy.<br>
        <strong>Rosemary.</strong> A good background plant since
        it gets tall (except trailing type); very aromatic.<br>
        <strong>English Thyme.</strong> Small leaves and low
        growth; the most used thyme for cooking.<br>
        Curly Spearmint. Pretty curly leaves and fresh mint
        flavor for use in fruit salad, drinks, and desserts.</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong></strong></em>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>Annual Herbs<br>
        </strong></em><em>(Plant new plants every year.)</em></p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Dill.</strong> Plant every year
        for the ferny foliage and distinctive fresh taste; much
        better fresh than dried. <br>
        <strong>Parsley.</strong> Easy to grow; plant in fall or
        early spring since it likes cool weather; bright green
        leaves. <br>
        <strong>Sweet Basil.</strong> Pesto lovers know the
        fragrance and wonderful taste of this herb; fresh leaves
        are much better than dried.<br>
        <br>
        Add other basils, caraway, chervil, garlic chives,
        cilantro, scented geraniums, lovage, sweet marjoram,
        lemon grass, more mints, some of the other oreganos, any
        of the sages, winter savory, french sorrel, french
        tarragon, and other thymes in that extra space!</p>
        <h3 align="left"><em><strong>Fragrance Garden</strong></em></h3>
        <p align="left">Plant these herbs for their delightful
        scents! Full sun and not too much fertilizer will bring
        out the strongest scents. Plant them where you pass by
        often or near your front door as a greeting to your
        guests.</p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Lavendin Provence or Seal.</strong>
        That lavender scent in a plant that is a little easier to
        grow in our heavy soils. The other lavenders benefit from
        containers or raised beds and a sandy soil mix.<br>
        <strong>Rosemary.</strong> Very fragrant leaves on
        evergreen shrubs. Arp, Hill Hardy are Furneaux Hardy are
        all cold hardy selections. Trailing rosemary makes a
        great hanging basket that will scent a room.<br>
        <strong>Lemon Verbena.</strong> The most wonderful lemon
        fragrance! This shrubby grower is winter tender so it
        makes a good potted plant to bring in for the winter.
        Small plants set in the garden in spring make good size
        plants by fall. <br>
        <strong>Pineapple Sage.</strong> It really does smell
        like pineapple and it has beautiful bright red flowers in
        late summer and fall. Somewhat winter tender but easy
        care.<br>
        <strong>Mexican Mint Marigold.</strong> Pair with
        Pineapple Sage for a great combination. Both grow 3-4'
        tall and the small yellow flowers of this plant are a
        good contrast with the red of the sage. It has a licorice
        scent and narrow leaves. Heat tolerant.<br>
        <strong>Chocolate Mint.</strong> Plant in containers to
        contain its spread - or let it go and enjoy a big area of
        this wonderful fragrance! Mints like more moisture than
        most herbs and can grow in part shade.<br>
        <strong>Nutmeg Geranium.</strong> An attractive plant
        with a trailing habit, this scented geranium is well
        suited to a container.</p>
        <p align="left">Other fragrance plants are basils,
        eucalyptus, other scented geraniums, hyssop, other
        lavenders, lemon balm, lemon grass, other mints, sweet
        myrtle, panama rose, southernwod, and vicks plant.</p>

        <p>The benefits from adding lilies to your pond are
        numerous. They provide shelter for your fish, filtrate
        and shade the pond, reducing algae.<br>
        Lilies are easy to care for and divide. They should be
        planted in a container without holes (to keep contained
        to pot) in a dense clay soil. Fertilize with any tablet
        prescribed for water plants once a month, during the
        growing season.<br>
        Division is best in spring. Cutting tubers and root stock
        with sharp knife is easy and fast. Simply repot new
        cuttings in desired soil and cover top with rocks. This
        anchors plant in soil; and helps keep fish out of soil.
        Sit back and let the blooms begin.<br>
        Water lilies are in full bloom at North Haven Gardens.
        Whether you are adding a new hardy variety to your pond
        or the exotic look of a tropical we have one for you.

        long petals. Flowers stand above water. Blooms until late
        fall. <br>
        Charlene Strawn - Superb yellow hardy lily that blooms
        over a long season. Holds flowers above the water. A free
        bloomer.<br>
        Comanche - Large blooms of rich apricot color changing to
        dark coppery-orange with tinges of red as flower ages.
        Hardy. <br>

        by: Don Miller</p>
        <p>The show and sale of the Southwest region of the
        American Begonia Society was an outstanding success. The
        show featured begonia varieties of the past and some of
        the newest begonia species and hybrids of the future.
        Eight horticultural groups of begonias were represented.<br>
        The smallest entry was a begonia 'Smidgens' grown in a
        1/2 inch pot. One of the largest plants there was a four
        foot specimen of Begonia 'Flamingo Queen' with its huge
        silver spotted, green leaves and large clusters of pink
        flowers. Also begonia 'Peach Parfait' stood three feet
        and full of clusters of peachy orange flowers. 'Best
        Plant in Show' by the official ABS Judges was the South
        American specie Begonia foliosa. This species is
        sometimes called the &quot;fern begonia&quot;. This
        begonia with graceful arching stems, covered with tiny
        green leaves and white flowers was grown by Jeff Kirsch
        of Wylie Texas. The show ended with tours of The Begonia
        Species Collection at the Fort Worth Botanical Garden and
        North Haven Gardens. North Haven has the best retail
        collection of exotic begonias in the state. You can
        purchase starts of most of these prize winners from North
        Haven's Collection of over 300 varieties.</p>

        <p>Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a
        locomotive, able to leap Coral Honeysuckle in a single
        bound! It's a bird, it's a plane, it's superbird, a.k.a.
        the hummingbird.<br>
        <br>
        The hummingbird is the smallest bird in the world and
        undoubtedly, one of natures most incredible creatures.
        Here are just a few of the amazing but true facts about
        these colorful birds-.<br>
        <br>
        1. The only bird to fly backwards and upside-down.<br>
        2. While hovering, their wings beat at 78 beats per
        second<br>
        3. Extremely adaptable, they can live as far north as
        Alaska and as far south as Tierra del Fuego.<br>
        4. Some have been clocked as fast at 55 mph.<br>
        5. There are 319 species of hummingbirds in the world; 18
        in North America; only 2 are common in our area, the
        Ruby-throated and the less common Black-chinned.</p>
        <p>Hummingbirds are in our area from late April to
        mid-October. The key to attracting them to backyard
        feeders is to have the feeders out when the birds first
        arrive in your neighborhood. Your flowering plants act as
        a welcome mat to the hummers, while your sugar water
        feeders will provide a steady source of nectar. As a side
        benefit, about half their diet consists of spiders,
        flies, aphids and gnats. Don't give up if you have no
        hummers in May or June. In our area they usually don't
        show up in any numbers until the first week of July.<br>
        <br>
        Suggested plantings would include Penta, Salvia, Cardinal
        Flower, Firebush, Columbine, Bee Balm, Lantana, Begonias,
        Impatiens, Zinnias, Turk's Cap, Flame Acanthus,
        Gayfeather, Hibiscus, Abelia, Vitex, Desert Willow,
        Honeysuckle, Cypress Vine, Clematis, Passion Flower Vine,
        Morning Glory and Trumpet Vine.<br>
        <br>
        Feeding Tips to keep those hummers happy include:<br>
        1. The best recipe is I part sugar (no honey, please) to
        4 parts water, to make large quantities boil bottle and
        refrigerate.<br>
        2. Clean feeder with hot water (no soap or bleach) at
        each refill and replace the sugar water every 3-5 days.<br>
        3. Do not add red food coloring. Most feeders have red on
        them as an attractant.<br>
        4. Place feeders in a shady spot if possible- this keeps
        the nectar cooler as summer beats up.<br>
        5. If you want multiple feeders, place them out of view
        of each other or place them in a line. The theory here is
        that the dominant males (ruby throated ones) won't be
        able to defend all the feeders at once.<br>
        6. Feed the hummers as long as they're a-round. Having
        the feeders up will not delay their migration. Their
        migration south is based on length of day.<br>
        <br>
        So plant those nectar-flowers, get those feeders up and
        enjoy watching the amazing acrobatics of Nature's
        helicopter!</p>

        by: Bob McLaughlin</p>
        <p>Summer days may be long and hot; however they can
        offer some of the most rewarding times for the gardener.
        A few preventive steps along the way together with good
        garden practices will yield maximum results.<br>
         The addition of 2 inches of mulch can cut down on the
        amount of water you need since it tends to retain soil
        moisture. It will also keep weeds from germinating and if
        they have come up they are much easier to pull. The
        addition of mulch can result in a dramatic lowering of
        soil temperatures thus lessening stress.<br>
         Check your plants frequently ( every two or three
        days) by looking at leaves and blooms for incipient
        insect problems. It is much easier to control insects if
        they are caught in the early stages of infestation.<br>
         When you water, do it thoroughly and deeply (1&quot; -
        2 &quot; per week). Just hitting the plants lightly every
        day or two with hand watering will result in a shallower
        root system and more heat stress for your plants.<br>
         Keep a record of your fertilizing on a regular basis.</p>

        by: Sally Moore</p>
        <p>Whether you have had the foresight to plan a cutting
        garden or have been fortunate to experience NHG's Cut
        Flower Happy Hour, I'm sure you've learned that there is
        nothing quite like fresh flowers in the home.<br>
        <br>
        Here are a few tips on using those flowers in
        arrangements around your home:<br>
        <br>
        Stand in the doorway of each room and study it as a
        whole, Focus on individual elements, colors of walls and
        carpets; tones in paintings; size, shape and style of
        containers-before beginning an arrangement. All these
        elements play a part in the choice of flowers to accent
        the surroundings.<br>
        <br>
        Follow no rules apart from certain basics: starting at
        the top to establish height, lots of fresh water; and
        fine chicken wire. The wire must be soft, to prevent
        damaging fine vases and precious antiques. Now, just let
        the flowers guide you.<br>
        <br>
        If you are thinking of a cutting garden, this is my
        suggested list of long lasting flowers that grow well in
        our area. Perennials like Lilies, Delphiniums, Peonies,
        Irises, Phloxes, Anemones, Sweet William and Yarrow.
        Annuals such as Lisianthus, Snapdragons, Poppies and
        Dahlias. Chrysanthemums and Asters in the fall. The
        boughs of flowering trees and shrubs make great filters
        and greenery. Roses are a must for the cut flower garden-
        ' plant miniatures, climbers, hybrids and antiques!<br>
        <br>
        A cutting garden may be too much for you. In that case we
        would love to have you present at our Cut Flower Happy
        Hour. 2:00 to 6-00 every Friday. All cut flowers are half
        off. With the exception of the greenery.<br>
        World Wide Delivery available.</p>

        size="5"><strong> Studio: Texture in the Perennial Garden</strong></font><br>
        by Diana Herbert</p>
        <p>Designing a perennial bed requires the knowledge and
        combination of many variables. Plant selection is based
        upon plant heights, forms, colors and textures.<br>
        Of all the plant elements, the use of texture is perhaps
        the most subtle. Texture is a result of the structural
        relationships of the plant how the leaves are attached to
        the stem, the surface of the leaves, whether the leaves
        are dull or shiny, smooth or coarse, stiff or soft, large
        or tiny, etc. Texture as related to form varies from an
        open tracery to a dense mass. Placement of two dissimilar
        textures heightens the contrast of them both. Light on a
        leaf is important whether directly on the plant material
        or backlighted. A plant of large leaves and heavy texture
        appears more dense if backlighted.<br>
        The use of fine texture plus lightness of color will
        produce a sense of greater depth in a small space.
        Illusion of depth is created with coarse plants in front
        and fine in back. It is more important today to relate
        the texture and color of the house and its interior to
        the plant material in the garden since many gardens are
        to be viewed and not used. Strong clear greens,
        variegation, and shiny surfaces tend to represent
        tropical and humid climates. Grays, gray-greens, dull and
        fuzzy leaves tend to represent drier zones. A pleasing
        perennial bed would have a background of a house or
        fence, dark in color and uniform in texture and color to
        show off the flowers. The natural curving bed line would
        arc inward in the center. Then plant shrubs and
        perennials with fine and medium textured leaves in the
        center. The flowers are planted in long drifts which
        overlap to provide color and serve as accents when at
        their peak. Once their period of glory fades from the
        scene, they should disappear into the background. Use
        bolder or coarser leaves at the end of the flower border.
        This allows part of the bed to be hidden from view until
        the beholder comes into full view. The smaller the area
        the fewer the textures and colors should be used.</p>

        <p>One tree stands alone in defining the ultimate
        Southern Garden. Its large glistening white flowers lend
        the most exquisite fragrance to the garden where it
        resides. This evergreen tree also gives its rich textured
        branches to home decorating for weddings and during the
        Christmas season. Magnolia grandiflora, the stately
        southern favorite, can reach heights of over 100'. In
        most gardens, especially here in Dallas (heavy clay
        soils), they reach about 50'. The largest Magnolia
        recorded ,in Mississippi, was 52' in height with a 92'
        spread! Truly a magnificent tree!<br>
        Most urban landscapes cannot support such a large tree.
        So, are those of us with small gardens to be denied the
        luxury of having a Magnolia? Of course not!<br>
        Thanks to dedicated horticulturalists we have some fine
        selected cultivars with compact growing habits that will
        fit nicely into smaller, scaled down gardens. So be sure
        your southern garden has the traditional Southern
        Magnolia to add fragrance and beauty throughout the year.
        These two smaller compact varieties of Magnolia will fit
        nicely into your Southern Garden!<br>
        'Little Gem' : A medium sized tree reaching 25' in
        height. Compact narrowly columnar habit. Deep green
        foliage with a heavy brown felting to the back of leaves.
        Long bloom season. <br>
        'Goliath' Compact tree with a densely foliated round
        head. Leaves are wavy with very little brown backing.
        Cultivated for its very large <br>
        flowers . Reaches a height of 25 to 30 feet.<br>
        <br>
        For those gardens with plenty of room for a <br>
        standard sized Magnolia, here are some cultivars <br>
        worth looking into: <br>
        <br>
        Samuel Sommers: Selected for its very large flowers with
        strong fruit fragrance. Samuel Sommers has a larger leaf
        and blooms at an earlier age. <br>
        Ferruginea: An upright compact tree with large white
        blooms. This tree has outstanding foliage, large shiny
        leaves with deep rich green coloration. Rusty brown
        felting on leaf back creates a dramatic contrast.</p>
        <p><a name="Lavender"><font size="5"><strong>Lavender</strong></font></a><font
        size="5"><strong> for the Kitchen:</strong></font></p>
        <p>When most people think of Lavender, they recall sweet
        perfumed fragrances used in bath oils, soaps, sachets and
        potpourri. But did you know that you can eat lavender?
        Queen Elizabeth I drank sweet lavender tisane every day,
        and frequently served lavender conserve. The Queen knew
        how to use lavender, but for us, lavender is a new flavor
        in the kitchen. Lavender blends well with citrus (orange
        and lemon) fruits and herbs such as Basil, Tarragon,
        Parsley, Marjoram. and Lemon Geranium. Remember, use
        lavender in moderation, as you would all herbs. Lavender
        can be used to make Lavender Jelly, Lavender Orange Duck,
        Lavender Basil Chicken, Lavender Raspberry Cheese Cake
        and many other delights. We'll be selling an assortment
        of lavender jellies in our shop, The Herbal Haven.
        Lavender Orange, Lavender Lemon Geranium and Lavender
        jellies are now available. So, come by and try some.
        English and French Lavender in your culinary garden will
        produce flowers with the most fragrance and the best
        flavor. Lavender can be a little tricky to grow here. Its
        worst enemy is too much water. Plant your lavender in a
        raised bed with extra sand or small pebbles mixed into
        the soil. Lavender benefits from a mulch of sand, gravel
        or rocks. This helps to keep it drier. It is said that
        the lavendins, which are hybrid lavenders, will tolerate
        a little more water. Two varieties that we offer are,
        'Seal' and 'Provence'. Another variety of English
        lavender, that we grow, is 'Hidcote'. This dwarf variety
        gets only 18&quot; tall and is known for its showy deep
        purple flowers. Weather you grow lavender for its
        fragrance or flavor or just for its beautiful silver
        foliage and blue or purple flower spikes, it is a delight
        to grow and experience in the sunny garden.</p>
        <p><a name="Fall"><font size="5"><strong>Fall</strong></font></a><font
        size="5"><strong> Lawn Care:</strong></font></p>
        <p>September in Texas can be very confusing. While the
        calendar says fall is near, temperatures can still soar
        into the 90's. Your lawn needs attention now to maintain
        its health through the winter and be ready for re-growth
        in spring.<br>
        Now is the time for the last application of fertilizer
        for St. Augustine and Bermuda lawns. We recommend 100%
        organic fertilizers such as North Haven Organic, Texas
        Tee, Sustain or Milorganite. These products add
        slow-release, low concentrations of many nutrients that
        will feed the root systems of grasses over the coming
        months. They will not promote excessive top growth that
        can be subject to cold damage this winter. Apply at 10 -
        20 lbs. per 1000 sq. ft. Use the heavier rate if you've
        been using organic fertilizers less than two seasons.<br>
        If your grass needs some extra help, these are optional
        steps to improve it :<br>
        1 Aerate the lawn before applying the fertilizer. The
        simple addition of oxygen to the soil can make a dramatic
        improvement. Ever wonder why golf courses look so good
        frequent aeration.<br>
        2 Apply a granular humate such as Greensmith Humic Acid
        at the rate of 10 lbs. per 1000 sq. ft. This material is
        simply million - year- old compost which adds organic
        matter to the soil and more importantly, makes the
        nutrients from your fertilizer more available to your
        grass.<br>
        3 Apply one of the rock powders at the rate of 10 - 20
        lbs. per 1000 sq. ft. These include lava sand, greensand,
        granite sand or zeolite. These materials add trace
        minerals to the soil (greensand is 20% iron) and increase
        the exchange capacity of the soil.<br>
        Now is also the time to overseed winter grasses in your
        landscape. If you want to cover some bare spots
        temporarily or if you want to add grass to a shady area,
        the cool - season grasses are your choice. In sunny
        areas, you may use annual or perennial rye. In shady
        areas or under deciduous trees, the fescue varieties can
        be used. If you choose to overseed, you would not
        fertilize at this time. Instead, a light fertilization
        could be done in November and again in February if
        necessary.<br>
        The fall lawn care program should include leaving the
        clippings on the ground, mowing high, and watering deeply
        (1 inch at a time) and infrequently (every 5-7 days)
        depending on rainfall. <br>
        Taking care of your grass now will help it to breeze
        through the Texas winter and green up vigorously next
        spring .</p>

        <p>The beautiful washes of red and yellow, or pink and
        white color given by masses of Tulips and Hyacinths in
        the Spring are very impressive. However, their beauty
        often belies the hard work put into creating such a
        display. Tulips from Holland require several weeks of
        chilling to perform properly and planting when ground
        temperatures are around 50 degrees (mid-December). Once
        the display is over, so are the tulip bulbs you worked so
        hard to plant. I love tulips but, I want my tulips to
        come back! So I plant specie Tulips that return reliably
        each year. Two varieties that are well adapted for the
        south are Tulipa clusiana, from Iran and Tulipa
        chrysantha from India. Tulipa clusiana or Lady Tulip
        loves hot summers and alkaline soil. Lady Tulip sends up
        delicate red and white blooms in mid spring. Each flower
        has a long life, opening and closing as the sun rises and
        sets. Looks great planted with yellow Narcissus
        Trevithian another great naturalizer. Tulip chrysantha,a
        relation of clusiana, likes the same conditions but
        blooms a striking yellow and red flower. Chrysantha has a
        shorter habit and blooms a bit later. Ornithogalum
        umbellatum or Star of Bethelehem is another of my
        favorites. Expect an early spring eruption of white
        flowers from this prolific spreader. Flowers have an
        interesting green stripe on the back of each petal. Plant
        these great naturalizers with Bluebonnets, Pentstemon
        cobea or other naturalizing bulbs for an easy care spring
        floral display. Other naturalizing bulbs that are a must
        for southern gardens are: Lycoris radiata (Spider Lily)
        fall display of red spider like lilies. Lycoris
        Sqamigera, pink amaryllis like blooms in fall. Once
        planted these hardy bulbs will multiply and come back
        each year without constant care. <br>
        They're Naturals!</p>
        <p><a name="Cool"><font size="5"><strong>Cool</strong></font></a><font

        <p>Those cool breezes of fall that we have waited so
        longingly for are almost upon us. With the change of the
        season also comes the change in our landscape. Time to
        discard those dog-eared begonias and bedraggled Impatiens
        with the fresh faces of fall and winter. Chrysanthemums
        usually kick off the season with their multitude of color
        and form. However, the Mari - Mum, in shades of yellow
        and orange, has taken its rightful place in the fall
        line-up. Pansies are the true star of our cool season
        team. Their colors range from the most delicate of
        pastels to the vibrant jewel tones.<br>
        Wonderful companion plants to the pansies are Dianthus in
        shades of red, pink and white. Fragrant Stock in purples
        to pink and white. Dusty Miller for silvery-gray accent,
        ornamental Cabbage and Kale with their gorgeous ruffled
        foliage and Alyssum to create that beautiful carpet of
        white and purple.<br>
        For shadier spots in your yard look for Primrose which is
        the only flower to boast every primary color and Cyclamen
        in shades of pink and purple and red and white. Your
        winter garden need only be as limited as your
        imagination.</p>
        <p><a name="Longstem"><font size="5"><strong>Longstem</strong></font></a><font

        <p>Achillea, the genus for Yarrow includes over one
        hundred species found throughout North America, Europe
        and North and West Asia. There are four or five common
        species in the U.S. that are used both for commercial and
        garden flowers.<br>
        The genus Achillea was named for Achilles, the hero from
        Homer&#146;s Iliad. Legend has it that Achilles gave the
        plant to his soldiers to help stop the flow of blood from
        their wounds during the Trojan War. Yarrow has been
        called the &quot;all-healer.&quot; This perennial
        contains chemicals that help blood to clot. It has been
        used to fight fevers, increase appetites and help
        alleviate earaches, head colds, bruises, burns and
        toothaches.<br>
        Yarrow is available in many colors, however, yellow is
        its most common hue. Other colors include lavender, pink,
        white, mauve and red. Purchase fresh yarrow when the
        flower is fully open and stem is straight and sturdy. If
        the flowers are cut too soon, they shrivel, if to late
        the color fades. This wonderful flower is excellent for
        drying naturally, and retains its beautiful color after
        drying. Use yarrow in dried arrangements or your newest
        fall wreath. Contact NHG'S Florist for special orders.<br>
        Don't forget 2 to 6 on Fridays ... Cut Flower Happy Hour.</p>
        <p><a name="Foliage"><font size="5"><strong>Foliage</strong></font></a><font
        size="5"><strong> Color: </strong></font></p>
        <p>Flowering plants give the most outstanding show in the
        landscape. However, most blooms last but a short time and
        require careful planning in order to have color accents
        throughout the year. Color and contrast in the garden can
        be accomplished year round through the use of foliage
        color. First to mind is the brilliant fall foliage of
        deciduous trees such as Red Oak, Chinese Pistache, Sweet
        Gum, and Maple. Summer foliage color from ornamental
        trees can be achieved by planting Japanese Red Maple,
        Forest Pansy Red Bud, and Purple Leaf Plum.<br>
        The most dependable and long lasting foliage color comes
        from shrubs such as Texas Purple Sage, Elaeagnus,
        Nandina, Gold Dust Aucuba, Barberry, Vicary Privet,
        Chinese Fringe Flower, Osmanthus, and Burning Bush
        Euonymus. For brilliant color contrast and to add depth
        to your plantings use these in small repeating groupings
        according to height in front of a back drop of evergreen
        shrubs.<br>
        Foliage color in ground cover can make a striking
        statement in the planting scheme. Variegated Liriope,
        varying from shades of light green to almost silver in
        color makes an exciting contrast to darker ground covers
        such as Asian Jasmine or Ophiopogon in shady areas.<br>
        Gardeners utilize foliage color when planting many of our
        most dependable traditional annuals and perennials. What
        landscape would be complete without at least a few of the
        many outstanding color combinations possible from
        Caladiums, Coleus, Copper Leaf, Kale, Dusty Miller,
        Artemesia, Variegated Hydrangea, Lambs Ear, Amaranthus,
        and Houttuynia. Use these in combination with flowering
        annuals and perennials to compliment and expand the color
        bed. I like to use a small grouping of Dusty Miller in
        annual color plantings. The silver gray of the foliage
        seems to emphasize the brilliant colors of blooming
        plants. One of my favorite combinations is the burgundy,
        white, and pink array that can be achieved by planting
        Burgundy Sun Coleus as a background, Candidum Caladiums
        next and then Gin Begonias in the foreground.<br>
        Large sunny expanses can come alive with the color
        contrasts of ornamental grasses, from the very large
        Pampas Grass with it's tan plumes to the smaller
        Variegated Japanese Silver Grass, and Purple Fountain
        Grass with it's rich burgundy hues.Shady areas can be
        brightened by the many variations of leaf color and
        variegated patterns of Hostas. Even our old shade
        favorites, the ferns, can give us foliage contrast of
        gray blending of Japanese Painted Fern compared to the
        medium green Wood Fern and the darker green foliage of
        many other ferns.<br>
        The use of foliage color is often overlooked or happens
        by accident. Whether you want subtle, complementary, or
        contrasting color differences, these can be achieved by
        planning and designing foliage color into your garden. <br>
        Have fun!</p>

        Tis the season to wear Fantasy Hats. This festive head
        gear will make you the talk of the town. They are so
        avant-garde you really must see to believe! A little
        renaissance, a little Mardi-Gras, never-the-less a great
        gift or conversation piece. All that is natural is good!
        Do a nature tree with garden ornaments and oversized
        Lichen Balls. New Christmas bird egg colors are hot for
        Christmas &#133; you can thank Martha Stewart for that.
        We can supply you with two different sizes of the
        Grapevine Balls this year 12 and 18 inch. Drive by after
        dark anytime after November 1st and take note of these
        natural balls when lit! We are still sporting Polonaise
        hand blown glass. If you are not familiar with this
        wonderful traditional German glass you will love it! Very
        collectible and we have many pieces which are being
        retired! Crystal, crystal and more collectible spun glass
        crystal. All different and beautiful. Yea haw! The Lone
        Star Tree at NHG will have you two stepping through the
        nursery. Barcana trees! Look for the coupon in this
        newsletter. You won't find another deal like that,
        anytime soon. Kodak lights are in and available. But as
        you know we sell out very quickly. Well that's it.
        Don&#146;t forget our lighting and commercial and
        residential decorating services! Happy Holiday!</p>
        <p><a name="Texas"><font size="5"><strong>Texas - Where
        the Birds Are</strong></font></a><br>
        As if Texans needed something else to brag about, did
        your know the Lone Star State has the largest number of
        bird species, almost 600, followed by California, Arizona
        and Florida. In addition to the large resident
        population, winter months bring many new visitors to our
        North Texas backyards. Here are some of the birds you can
        expect to so see: American goldfinch, House Finch, Purple
        Finch, Ruby-Crowned Kinglet, Brown Thrasher, Cedar
        Waxwing, Yellow Rumped Warbler, White throated Sparrow,
        Dark eyed Junco, Sharp Shinned Hawk. There are several
        things you can do to attract and feed your winter guests:</p>
        <p>Put up a thistle feeder (especially for Goldfinches)
        and tie a yellow ribbon on it.</p>
        <p>Add a suet feeder to provide protein and fat to keep
        the birds warm; suet cakes come in many flavors such as
        almond, peanut and berry. Many species will eat suet, and
        there are several types of feeders to &quot;suet your
        needs&quot;.</p>
        <p>Add a peanut feeder or offer peanuts in a platform
        feeder.It&#146;s fascinating to watch a Chickadee,
        Kinglet or Bluejay try to extract a peanut while hanging
        on the feeder.</p>
        <p>Offer fresh water during the winter months. This could
        be in a shallow, plastic or metal saucer since concrete
        bird baths might crack in the winter.</p>
        <p>Set out fruit (apples, oranges, raisins, cranberries)
        either in a platform feeder or nailed to a fence or tree.
        Robins, Woodpeckers, Bluejays, and Mockingbirds will
        enjoy this treat.</p>
        <p>Build a brush pile in an area visible from a window
        and toss seed such as millet, sunflower or safflower into
        it every 2-3 days.Many birds prefer feeding in a brushy
        thicket which you can create in your backyard.</p>
        <p>Which seed is best? The answer depends on what species
        you want to attract. The hands-down favorite of all the
        birds that visit tube and house type feeders is black oil
        sunflower. White millet is favored Doves, Sparrows and
        Juncos. Thistle (black) brings in the Goldfinches house
        finches and Chickadees. In my own yard, I feed safflower
        seed which discourages house Sparrows, Grackles,
        Starlings and Squirrels. Be aware that many of the
        inexpensive grocery store mixes contain seeds birds don't
        prefer and will not eat. The most effective way to
        attract the largest variety of birds to your yard is to
        put to separate feeders for each food that is, a house
        feeder for sunflower, tube feeder for thistle, wire cage
        for peanuts, platform or brush pile for millet, suet cage
        for suet. So migrate to our &quot;Bird Haven&quot;
        department and let us help you create a winter bird
        habitat for your backyard.</p>

                let them stand in water.</li>
            <li>Poinsettias do not like a cold draft.</li>
            <li>Place them clear of vents, these can be drying

        <p><a name="Christmas"><font size="5"><strong>Christmas
        Tree Care</strong></font></a><br>
        Fresh cut trees need to stay cool and moist to remain in
        top condition. Keep your tree well watered. If water
        level drops below cut end of trunk a seal will form
        preventing the tree from taking up water. Place tree away
        from drafts and heating vents. North Haven has top
        quality trees that receive a fresh cut and have been
        treated with an anti-transpirant to help retain moisture.</p>
        <p><a name="Now"><font size="5"><strong>Now's The Time</strong></font></a><font
        size="5"><strong>/November &amp; December</strong></font><br>
        <strong>Plant:</strong> Pansies, Primrose, Cyclamen.
        Narcissus bulbs now, Tulips and Hyacinths in mid
        December. Transplant trees and shrubs.<br>
        <strong>Prune:</strong> Dormant trees. Summer blooming
        shrubs. Weak or damaged wood.<br>
        <strong>Feed:</strong> The birds. Purchase quality feed.
        Like black oil sunflower, safflower and Niger Thistle.
        Make sure to provide water also. <br>
        <strong>Reduce:</strong> Fertilizer applications and
        watering on houseplants. Keep those leaves clean!<br>
        <strong>Fertilize: </strong>Tulips with bone meal when
        you plant. Pansies with blood meal.<br>
        <strong>Protect:</strong> Be sure to have plenty of Frost
        Cloth on hand for extreme freezes.</p>
        <p><a name="winter"><font size="5"><strong>The Winter
        Landscape</strong></font></a><br>
        During the warm months our senses are aroused by the
        brilliant colors, sultry fragrances and lush growth in
        the gardens and landscapes that surround us. But the
        winter landscape appeals to us on a more intellectual
        plane. The garden is quieter during this dormant period,
        as much of the foliage and bloom has disappeared. Yet the
        garden in winter can still offer many rewards, whether
        viewed from inside the house or enjoyed on a chilly, yet
        pleasant, afternoon. The secret, of course, lies in the
        planning. The key to successful, all season garden is
        structure, with a capital &quot;S&quot;. When the trees
        are laid bare and the annuals have died down, the
        &quot;bones&quot; of the garden become more apparent.
        suddenly shapes and lines and forms take the center
        stage, once held by masses of color and rich greenery.
        This is the true test of the landscape design and the
        best time, because there are fewer distractions, to look
        around you with a critical eye and assess the structure
        of your garden. Do the shapes of the hedges and beds flow
        well with those of the house and paved areas? Are the
        vertical lines of the house and trees in a visually
        pleasing relationship? Are the different areas of the
        garden linked by the repetition of hard and soft features
        such as paving materials and shrub groupings? The winter
        season provides us with and opportunity to determine
        which changes, if any, are to be made in the overall
        structure of the garden. But what kinds of colors and
        interest can our plant material offer during the winter?
        Plenty! Did you know that the greens constitute our
        widest range of color perception? Once you become more
        aware of the varying tones and intensities of foliage
        color you will be able to plan a garden that is
        satisfying year &#145;round&#146;. And many of our
        commonly used evergreen shrubs take on red, purple or
        bronze hues during the cold months. Nandina, certain
        Junipers and Abelia are examples of this, as is Purple
        Winter Creeper, a reliable groundcover. Color is found in
        the fruit and berries that cling throughout winter.
        Possumhaw, Foster, Savannah and Yaupon Hollies, Mahonia,
        Pyracantha, Soapberry and Coralberry come to mind, along
        with the rugosa and other Roses that develop large,
        colorful rosehips. Deciduous trees are a necessary part
        of the garden for the interesting seasonal changes they
        provide. Many give us spectacular fall color and spring
        bloom. But don&#146;t overlook the drama of their winter
        shapes and silhouettes as well. The sharply cast shadow
        of a well pruned shade tree on a lawn or patio is and
        exquisite landscape feature. If your garden is too small
        for another large tree consider some of the attractive
        smaller ones such as weeping Mulberry, Star and Saucer
        Magnolias, with their delightful spring blooms, or
        Japanese maple, including the spectacular Coral Bark
        variety with its intense red bark. Remember also that
        deciduous shrubs and trees give strength and permanence
        to their evergreen companions. and while enjoying your
        lovely, all season garden don't forget our feathered
        friends. Birds bring color and life to any garden, no
        matter how small, and lend intimacy to the most
        expansive, formal gardens. Please consider including them
        in your overall scheme, especially during the winter
        months. Many thanks and happy gardening from your friends
        at NHG!</p>

        Joe Steele</i></strong></p>
        <p><font size="3">The vivid golden spray of flowers from
        the Oncidium orchid or the soft velvety white blooms of a
        Phalaenopsis are sure to brighten any home interior.
        These regal plants belie their ease of care. Though very
        different in form, many Orchid varieties can be cared for
        the same. The most common Orchids at local nurseries are
        Phalaenopsis, Dendrobiums and Oncidiums. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Phalaenopsis typically have large flat
        leaves with a tall flower spike. Sometimes the flower
        spikes are split or branched. This adds to the number of
        flowers you can expect. Typically Phalaenopsis blooms
        last from 2 to 4 months. They need bright indirect light
        and should be allowed to dry out between waterings.
        Optimum temperatures for Phalaenopsis are between 65 to
        70 degrees year round. When flowers start to drop cut the
        flower spike between the first flower and the last node.
        They will usually grow another spike from the first node.
        Phalaenopsis colors vary but white and pink are most
        common.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Dendrobiums usually have 15 to 18
        upright stems with 3 to 5 inch pointed leaves off of
        them. The flower spikes form at the tops of the newest
        stems. Dendrobiums prefer bright light and 60 to 90
        degree temperatures. Let them dry out between watering as
        Orchid roots have a great water holding capacity and with
        too much they can become waterlogged and begin to
        deteriorate. They are usually sold in four inch pots with
        1 to 3 flower spikes. After blooming allow to dry for one
        month then repot and fertilize. They come in a full range
        of colors. Blooms last from 1 to 2 months. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Oncidiums can be recognized by their
        large pseudo bulbs. From the upper end of the bulb grows
        elongated 8&quot; to 12&quot; leaves. Flower spikes can
        be from 12&quot; to 48&quot; tall and are heavily
        branched. The flowers themselves are usually yellow or
        white with reddish brown barring and are one inch in
        size. Give them bright light and 70 to 80 degree
        temperatures. After blooming remove spike at the base and
        resume fertilizing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">These may be the most common Orchids
        but, there are many other beautiful and interesting
        varieties. Cattleyas, Slipper Orchids and Nuns Orchids to
        name a few. Come see our Orchid collection at North
        Haven. We also have a full line of orchid care products
        and supplies. It will be our pleasure to assist you in
        the care of your orchids. </font></p>

                guarantee a years wait for fruit. Strawberries

        <p><font size="3">On a cold winter day, what could be
        better than curling up with a good book? Well, if you're
        a gardening enthusiast, you can score twice; plan your
        garden for next spring while at the same time doing some
        fun reading. North Haven Gardens has some excellent books
        to help you do just that. Some of these books have been
        available for awhile, but are a must for your reference
        shelf. You will use them till they are dog-eared, but the
        information will always be good; others are new and well
        worth the wait. Let's look at just a few of these
        offerings:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><u>Neil Sperry's Complete Guide to
        Texas Gardening, 2nd. Ed.</u></font></p>
        <p><font size="3">This favorite stand-by has been revised
        and updated with lush photos, current information and
        recommended latest fruit and vegetable varieties.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><u>The Old Farmers' Almanac,</u> By
        Robert D. Thomas</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">This has been, since 1792, the standard
        reference for weather forecasts, planting dates and
        wisdom in general. You can't put it down.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><u>Planting Manual for Dallas Area
        Gardens </u>by the Dallas Garden Club of the Dallas
        Woman's Club.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">These ladies have been dispensing
        wonderful gardening help since their founding in 1926.
        For the Dallas area in particular, their month by month
        suggestions plus articles on gardening will be referred
        to over and over.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><u>Plants of the Metroplex III, </u>by
        Howard Garrett.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Dallas' foremost organic guru has
        included the latest info on organic thinking plus a
        feature which I have always found to be very useful to
        anyone planting a garden. He tells you suggested height,
        spread and spacing on plants.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><u>The Vegetable Book, A Texan's Guide
        to Gardening, </u>by Dr. Sam Cotner. Dr. Cotner is head
        of the department of horticulture at Texas A. &amp; M.
        University. He is a recognized expert on all aspects of
        vegetable growing. Reading this book is like having the
        &quot;Prof&quot; at your side giving you personal advice.
        If you like to grow veggies, you have to have this one.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><u>The Organic Rose Garden, </u>by Liz
        Druitt</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Ms. Druitt combines a love of nature
        along with an extensive knowledge of old garden roses.
        She will list varieties which, after you have read about
        them, you will swear you absolutely must have. Her
        organic approach from the initial bed prep to the end of
        the growing season makes fascinating reading.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">After you have read some of these books
        if you aren't in a frenzy to get out and garden, have
        someone check your pulse!</font></p>

        extra special gift selection. With the hectic pace of the
        holidays behind us, we can take the time to plan for the
        gifts we need now as well as those for early spring.
        North Haven is now carrying the Brass Baron collection of
        fountain and pond accessories with beautiful cranes,
        spouting fish and frogs. This is a must see to enjoy the
        beautiful selection. Also, special orders from the Brass
        Baron catalog are welcome. Our new slate table top
        fountains are the perfect addition to the patio or garden
        room. They will give that relaxing natural sound to any
        area they are used in. Our large section of orchids will
        delight and add the beauty of the tropics to our winter
        decor. We have a large collection of metal trellis with
        hand painted nature scenes for large containers. You may
        like one of the new welcome signs for gates or doors.
        These come in several decorative designs: birds, fish,
        birdhouses, butterflies and watering cans. Our solid teak
        benches, chairs and tables add beauty to any room. Pile
        them high with bright pillows and forget it is winter.
        And as always our popular gift certificates may be
        purchased in any amount for that special gift</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">See you at the gift store that makes
        shopping fun.</font></p>

        <p><font size="3">In tropical regions, their native
        habitat, Begonias are used by the native people for food
        and medicine. Americans are now beginning to learn how to
        use Begonias as a food and are doing research on their
        medicinal properties. Use begonia flowers and stems as a
        salad herb and delightful garnish. In the language of
        herbs begonias symbolize 'attention' and 'woes be gone'.
        Now you can enjoy these beautiful flowers in your garden
        and on your dinner plate too! </font></p>

        beds now for spring planting. Work in plenty of compost
        for good drainage. Spread out at least 2&quot; of mulch
        around each existing bush to protect against sudden
        temperature drops. </font></p>

Center not only to help you understand the world of investments, but also to
help you understand how <I>you</I>  relate to that world.  You can find how
much you already know, determine what kind of risks  you're comfortable taking
when investing, and examine which types of investments may be best suited to
your goals.  And when you're done, you can even ask a Strong portfolio manager a
question.  So have fun and explore . . . we hope you'll learn something about
investments and perhaps something about yourself as well!

Many investors spend very little time managing their <I>cash</I> - the assets
that usually sit in low-yielding accounts for extended periods of time. To
help you manage your cash effectively, we've created a group of innovative,

  <DD>
    The Strong Heritage Money Fund is designed to provide a yield that, over
    time, is higher than the typical money fund. To do so, it's structured to
    keep expenses low, because expenses directly affect a money fund's yield.
    To reduce costs, the Fund requires investors to maintain higher account balances,
    enabling it to take advantage of economies of scale. With certain exceptions,
    the Fund also charges fees for individual transactions.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/g3.jpg>
<A HREF=/strong/Our_Funds/Conservative_Equity/utilprfl.ht1__1-4>THE
STRONG AMERICAN UTILITIES FUND</A>
<P>
The Fund invests primarily in the stocks of public utility companies. The
Fund's subadvisor and portfolio manager, W.H. Reaves &amp; Co., offers decades
of specialized investment management in utility stock investing. The managers
select stocks based on sound financial and management characteristics, and
elements of change they believe are not yet fully recognized by the market.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/g4.jpg>
<A HREF=/strong/Our_Funds/Conservative_Equity/totlprfl.ht1__1-4>THE
STRONG TOTAL RETURN FUND</A>
<P>
The Total Return Fund emphasizes investments in large- and medium-sized
companies. The Fund's managers seek well-managed companies with accelerating
sales and earnings, expanding market share, and a sustainable competitive
advantage.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/g5.jpg>
<A HREF=/strong/Our_Funds/Conservative_Equity/grinprfl.ht1__1-4>THE
STRONG GROWTH AND INCOME FUND</A>
<P>
The Fund seeks high total return by investing for capital growth and income.
It invests primarily in larger companies, and will focus on those that pay
current dividends and offer potential growth of earnings. The Fund may also
invest in smaller companies and value stock for added growth potential.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/g6.jpg>
<A HREF=/strong/Our_Funds/Schafer/schaprfl.ht1__1-4>THE
STRONG SCHAFER VALUE FUND</A>
<P>
The Strong Schafer Value Fund uses a disciplined process that favors medium-
to large-capitalization companies and a fully invested approach that helps
eliminate market timing errors. The Fund manager's approach emphasizes simplicity
and discipline. For instance, each holding in the portfolio is approximately
equally weighted. When an attractive, new opportunity is found, the manager
typically won't buy it unless he can use it to replace a less-attractively
valued stock. Because of the manager's buy and hold strategy, portfolio turnover
is very low.

<P>
<A HREF=/strong/Our_Funds/Growth_Funds/valuprfl.ht1__1-4>THE
STRONG VALUE FUND</A>
<P>
The Strong Value Fund is the most conservative of the Strong Growth Funds.
In selecting investments for the Fund, the managers first identify catalysts
-- whether company specific or affecting an industry -- that seem likely
to increase the value of a company over time. They then apply rigorous
fundamental research and valuation screens to determine which specific companies
appear to offer superior value in relation to their share price.
<P>
<ALIGN=LEFT> <IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/strong/images/b2.jpg">
<P>
<A HREF=/strong/Our_Funds/Growth_Funds/oppprfl.ht1__1-4>THE
STRONG OPPORTUNITY FUND</A>
<P>
The Opportunity Fund currently emphasizes medium-sized companies which the
managers believe are under-researched and attractively valued. To identify
opportunities, the Fund's managers use a disciplined approach to stock selection,
relying on exhaustive research to determine whether a stock may be overvalued
or undervalued.
<P>
<ALIGN=LEFT><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/strong/images/b3.jpg">
<P>
<A HREF="/strong/Our_Funds/Growth_Funds/midcpprfl.ht1">THE STRONG MID CAP
FUND</A>
<P>
The Mid Cap Fund invests primarily in equity securities of high potential
emerging growth companies that have medium market capitalizations. &nbsp;The
Fund takes a disciplined approach to investing by combining a top-down market
and secular perspective with bottom-up analysis that optimizes the stock
selection process. &nbsp;
<P>
<ALIGN=LEFT><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/strong/images/b4.jpg">
&nbsp;<A HREF=/strong/Our_Funds/Growth_Funds/groprfl.ht1__1-4>THE
STRONG GROWTH FUND</A>
<P>
The Fund invests in stocks that the manager believes offer above average
growth potential at a reasonable price. In general, the Fund seeks companies
with powerful earnings growth stemming from robust expansion, market dominance,
accelerating sales, and proven management. It invests in companies of all
sizes.
<P>
<ALIGN=LEFT> <IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/strong/images/b5.jpg">

&nbsp;<A HREF=/strong/Our_Funds/Growth_Funds/commprfl.ht1__1-4>THE
STRONG COMMON STOCK FUND</A>
<P>
<I>(Open only to current Common Stock Fund shareholders)</I><BR>
The Fund currently emphasizes the stocks of small companies, which offer
very high return potential and greater-than-average volatility. Managed by
the same team that directs the Strong Opportunity Fund, the Common Stock
Fund features the same value-conscious, disciplined approach to stock selection.
<P>
<ALIGN=LEFT> <IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/strong/images/b6.jpg">
<P>
&nbsp;<A HREF=/strong/Our_Funds/Growth_Funds/smcpprfl.ht1__1-4>THE
STRONG SMALL CAP FUND</A>
<P>
The Strong Small Cap Fund invests in the stocks of small companies. Historically,
these stocks have provided greater returns with more risk than the stocks
of larger, more established companies. The Fund's manager attempts to reduce
these risks through careful research, personal visits with company management,
and rigorous analysis of market and economic trends.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <BR>
<IMG BORDER="0" SRC="/strong/images/b7.jpg">&nbsp;<A HREF=/strong/Our_Funds/Growth_Funds/discprfl.ht1__1-4>THE
STRONG DISCOVERY FUND</A>
<P>
The Fund invests in companies that are poised to benefit from emerging trends,
and seeks to do so at the most opportune time. To gain additional insight
beyond normal research, the Fund's management stresses personal contact with
those who run the companies in which the Fund invests.

<P>Strong offers two international bond funds and two international stock 
funds for investors who want to diversify their holdings beyond the U.S. 
markets. <BR>
<BR>
A portfolio diversified with international
  mutual funds can offer the potential for
  higher returns, but also entails special
  risks. These risks include currency
  fluctuations, political and economic
  instability, and illiquid markets. The
  value of the Funds' investments and
  their share prices will vary from day to
  day in response to these factors. These risks are intensified in emerging markets. The
  risks involved with international investing
  can be reduced by professional
  management and broad diversification,
  but cannot be eliminated.

<A HREF="/rafiles/Portfolio/8basics.ram"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/strong/images/realaud2.gif"></A>These common-sense rules are followed by many successful investors. They make sense for beginners, too. If you have a question regarding these principles, or would like to discuss them with us, please contact us at 1-800-359-3379. We're here 24 hours a day, seven days a week to take your call.<BR>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<HR>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/Portfolio/file.jpg><H3><I>Have a plan.</I></H3>
Even a simple plan can help you take control of your financial future. Review your plan once a year, or if your circumstances change.
<P><BR CLEAR=ALL><HR>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/Portfolio/clock.jpg><BR>
<H3><I>Start investing as soon as possible.</I></H3>
Make time a valuable ally. Let it put the power of compounding to work for you, while helping to reduce your potential investment risk.<P><BR CLEAR=ALL>



<HR>


<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/Portfolio/pie2.jpg>
<H3><I>Diversify your portfolio.</I></H3> 
By investing in different asset classes -- stocks, bonds, and cash -- you help protect against poor performance in one type of investment while including investments most likely to help you achieve your important goals.<P><BR CLEAR=ALL>




<HR>


<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/Portfolio/paper.jpg>
<H3><I>Invest regularly.</I></H3> 
Investing is a process, not a one-time event. By investing regularly over the long term, you reduce the impact of short-term market gyrations, and you attend to your long-term plan before you're tempted to spend those assets on short-term needs.<P><BR CLEAR=ALL>




<HR>


<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/Portfolio/graph.jpg>
<H3><I>Maintain a long-term perspective.</I></H3> 
For most individuals, the best discipline is staying invested as market conditions change. Reactive, emotional investment decisions are all too often a source of regret -- and of principal loss.<P><BR CLEAR=ALL>




<HR>


<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/Portfolio/pie.jpg>
<H3><I>Consider stocks to help achieve major long-term goals.</I></H3>
Over time, stocks have provided the more powerful returns needed to help the value of your investments stay well ahead of inflation.<P><BR CLEAR=ALL>




<HR>


<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/Portfolio/dollar.jpg>
<H3><I>Keep a comfortable amount of cash in your portfolio.</I></H3> 
To meet current needs, including emergencies, use a money market fund or a bank account -- not your long-term investment assets.<P><BR CLEAR=ALL>




<HR>


<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/Portfolio/glass.jpg>
<H3><I>Know what you're buying.</I></H3> 
Make sure you understand the potential risks and rewards associated with each of your investments. Ask questions ... request information ... make up your own mind. And choose a fund company that helps you make informed investment decisions.<P><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<HR>
<P>Whether you're looking forward to a semi-retirement at 45, early retirement
at 55, or full retirement at 65 or later, choosing the right mix of investments
can be crucial.
</P>
<P>Being too cautious can be a mistake when you're investing for your future.
Many people believe that the best thing they can do with their nest egg is to
put it in a portfolio of low-risk investments, such as certificates of deposit
or money market funds. While such investments can offer regular payments and
help preserve your principal, they generally don't protect your savings against
the relentless effect of inflation or provide the growth you need to achieve
your retirement savings goals.*
</P>
<P>That's why you should consider stocks as part of your overall portfolio.
Historically, stocks have increased in value much faster than fixed-rate
investments and have significantly outpaced inflation over the long term. While
stocks can be more volatile in the short-term, their volatility has tended to
even out over time. So the longer you have to invest, the greater your use of
stocks generally can be.
</P>
<P>Even if you're retired, or close to retiring, consider keeping a portion of
your assets in stocks. That way, you give your investments the opportunity to
retain more purchasing power throughout your retirement. Please keep in mind
that these sample allocations aren't meant to be definitive. Rather, they're
intended to give you a point of reference when considering your own unique
situation.

<P>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="4">Investing: A Long-Term Commitment</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Tending a garden, raising a child...learning a musical
instrument... all these activities have a fundamental element in common:
each is a <I>process</I>, not a one-time event.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The same is true of investing for a major goal. It's an endeavor
that must be pursued with logic, patience, and diligence over a long period,
often decades. Of course, being disciplined about investing is seldom easy.
Sometimes, short-term needs interfere with your plans, or the markets appear
to be headed for a downturn, or, sometimes, you may simply forget to add
to your account.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE="3">Fortunately, there's a way to help make discipline easier:
start an Automatic Investment Plan (AIP).</FONT></I>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="4">Take Control Of The Process With An AIP</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">An Automatic Investment Plan lets you automatically transfer
a pre-set amount of money from your bank account into a fund you choose at
regular intervals. You determine how much you want to invest, and how often.
In doing so, you purchase shares of the Fund at its then current share price.
Once you start your plan, it continues to make investments automatically,
so you don't have to worry about it. You work toward your goals step by step,
consistently, over time.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In addition to helping you organize the process of investing,
an Automatic Investment Plan offers several important advantages that may
boost your chances of reaching your important goals.</FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif"><FONT SIZE="3"><A HREF="#_wmh3_831413491">You
"Pay yourself first"</A><BR>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif"><A HREF="#_wmh3_831413520">You may
reduce your average cost of investing</A><BR>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif"><A HREF="#_wmh3_831413575">You don't
put off investing - featuring our Power of Compounding Calculator</A></FONT>
<H3>
  <I><A NAME="_wmh3_831413491">You "Pay yourself first."</A></I>
</H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Because it's automatic, an AIP ensures that you attend to
your long-term goals before you're tempted to spend those assets on a new
suit or a set of golf clubs. An AIP gives investing for your future the same
importance as your other periodic payments - your monthly bills, for example.
As a result, you're much more likely to stick with your plan until you reach
your goal. It's a great way to save three years for a down payment on a house,
or thirty years for retirement.</FONT>
<H3>
  <I><A NAME="_wmh3_831413520">You may reduce your average cost of
  investing.</A></I>
</H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">When you invest the same amount in a fund at regular intervals
over time, you buy more shares when the price is lower. Thus, you may reduce
your average cost per share over time. This strategy, called "dollar cost
averaging," helps make market fluctuations work <I>for</I> you, and reduces
the risk that you'll invest all your money right before a market
downturn.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Dollar cost averaging offers its greatest benefit with investments
that tend to regularly fluctuate in price, which is why Automatic Investment
Plans can be especially effective when used in conjunction with stock funds.
The share price of these funds can vary widely, but, through dollar cost
averaging, an AIP can make this volatility work<I> for</I> you. You gain
access to the stock market's growth potential, and you may reduce your cost
of investing over the long term.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">You should keep in mind that dollar cost averaging can't guarantee
a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. So choose an amount
you feel comfortable investing under all market conditions.</FONT>
<H3>
  <I><A NAME="_wmh3_831413575">You don't put off investing.</A></I>
</H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">It's easy to delay investing until you believe the time is
"right." But putting off investing means you're not utilizing one of the
most potent benefits available to long-term investors: <B>the power of
compounding</B>. When you reinvest your dividends and capital gains, they
can add considerably to the growth potential of your investment over time.
And the longer you invest, the greater the effect of compounding
becomes:</FONT>

</CENTER>
<P><BR> Many investors overlook the importance of managing the &quot;cash&quot;
portion of their portfolios. Often, they let large amounts of short-term assets
remain in low-yielding accounts for extended periods of time. There is, however,
a smarter way to think about investing these assets. This approach -- known as
cash management -- has long been used by private banking institutions and
corporate finance departments. Now, with specialized money market funds and
ultra-short bond funds, this approach is available to a wider range of
investors.
</P>
<P><B>Four Steps to Managing Your Cash More Effectively</B><BR>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/one.gif"> <B>Divide your cash into
two groups.</B> The first step toward getting the most out of your cash is to
think of it in terms of two separate and distinct categories:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>    <B><I>Current Cash</I></B> -- the portion you generally put aside to
cover     regular transactions and routine expenditures and to save for goals
less     than one year away.<BR>    
<P>  </P></LI>
<LI>    <B><I>Portfolio Cash</I></B> -- the portion you tend to keep
untouched in     your portfolio for extended periods. Usually, it's used as a
savings vehicle     for goals between one and two years away, to cover
unforeseen emergencies,     or as a permanent, conservative position in your
investment portfolio.<BR>    
<P></P></LI></UL>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/two.gif"> <B>Consider all your
options.</B> Many investors keep current cash and portfolio cash in &quot;convenience&quot;
money funds, which typically require low minimum initial investments, offer an
array of services (such as free check writing), and provide relatively low
return potential. However, there are other options:<BR>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>    <B><I>Higher-Yielding Money Funds</I></B> -- these vehicles offer
more income     potential than &quot;convenience&quot; money funds. To pursue
higher yields, they often     entail certain restrictions, such as higher
balance requirements and charges     for transactions.<BR>    
<P>  </P></LI>
<LI>    <B><I>Ultra-Short Funds</I></B> -- designed to provide higher yields
than     money funds generally offer, these funds invest in bonds that have
longer     maturities and, in some cases, lower credit ratings. Unlike money
market     funds, the share price of an ultra-short fund will vary, although
most strive     to minimize fluctuation by maintaining very short average
portfolio maturities     -- usually less than one year.<BR>    
<P></P></LI></UL>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/three.gif"> <B>Allocate your cash
based on how you intend to use it.</B> The key to managing your cash effectively
is to allocate it according to how you expect to use it. Certainly, it's wise to
keep your current cash in an investment that allows you to withdraw it without
penalities and without tax consequences. But you can supplement that current
cash position with higher-yielding short-term vehicles that enable you to earn
more on your portfolio cash -- the money that tends to remain untouched in your
portfolio for more than a year.<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/four.gif"> <B>Consider municipal
investing.</B> You may be able to further enhance the return potential of your
cash by investing in a municipal bond fund. Because the income these funds
produce is exempt from federal income tax, you get to keep more of what you
earn, effectively increasing your investment returns.<BR>
</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>  <B>THE STRONG CASH MANAGEMENT FUNDS</B><BR>
</CENTER>
<P><A HREF="Our_Funds/Cash_Management/cashprot.ht1">The Strong Cash Management
Funds</A> are designed to give you the tools you need to put your
cash-management plan into action.<BR>
</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Strong Money Market Choices</B><BR>
</P>
<P>The money market funds in this group are designed to give you a variety of
conservative money fund options. Like all money market funds, they are managed
to maintain a stable $1.00 share price, although there can be no guarantee that
they will be able to do so. They invest at least 95% of their assets in &quot;first
tier&quot; money market securities and maintain average maturities of 90 days or
less.<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif">
<A HREF="Our_Funds/Cash_Management/mmmprfl.ht1">The Strong Municipal Money
Market Fund</A> invests only in high-quality, short-term municipal obligations
that present minimal credit risk.<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif">
<A HREF="Our_Funds/Cash_Management/hmfprfl.ht1">The Strong Heritage Money Fund</A>
seeks to provide a yield that, over time, is higher than the typical money fund.
To do so, it's structured to keep expenses low -- since expenses directly affect
a money fund's yield. The Fund therefore requires higher balances and, with
certain exceptions, charges a fee for individual transactions.<BR>
</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Strong Ultra-Short Choices</B><BR>
</P>
<P>To enhance the yield potential of your portfolio cash, Strong also offers
two ultra-short bond funds. In pursuit of higher yields than money funds
generally provide, both funds normally maintain a slightly longer average
maturity than money funds -- up to one year -- and may invest a limited amount
of assets in lower-rated bonds. Through exhaustive credit research, the funds'
managers seek to further enhance potential return and reduce potential
share-price fluctuation. Please note, however, that the share prices of these
funds do fluctuate, unlike those of money market funds.<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif">
<A HREF="Our_Funds/Cash_Management/advprfl.ht1">The Strong Advantage Fund</A>
invests primarily in ultra-short government bonds, mortgage-backed bonds, and
investment-grade corporate bonds. The Fund's average effective portfolio
maturity of is restricted to one year or less.<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif">
<A HREF="html/Our_Funds/Cash_Management/madvprfl.ht1">The Strong Municipal
Advantage Fund</A> is the first mutual fund designed to combine the potential
benefits of ultra-short and municipal investing. Like the Strong Advantage Fund,
it maintains an ultra-short maturity of one year or less. However, the Municipal
Advantage Fund invests primarily in municipal bonds, so its income is exempt
from federal income tax.<BR>

Expands Retirement Plan Opportunities</FONT></B><BR><BR></P>
<HR>
<P>On August 20, President Clinton signed into law HR 3448, <B>The Small
Business Job Protection Act of 1996</B>. The Act includes exciting new changes
including a number of pension simplification provisions, the creation of a new
small employer retirement plan vehicle, and a higher annual contribution
limitation applicable to IRAs for non-working spouses. The following are the
major provisions of the legislation:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif">
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">New Retirement Savings Plan Expands
Opportunities for Small Businesses</FONT></B></FONT><BR>The Act creates a new
simplified retirement plan for small businesses (generally, those with 100 or
fewer employees) called the Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (&quot;SIMPLE&quot;),
effective for years beginning after December 31, 1996. A SIMPLE plan can be
funded through an IRA for each employee or through a 401(k) plan. The plan would
be exempt from nondiscrimination and extensive reporting requirements if the
employer guarantees a certain level of contributions.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"> <FONT SIZE="+1"><B><FONT
COLOR="#000080">SIMPLE Plan Replaces SAR-SEP</FONT></B></FONT><BR>With the
implementation of SIMPLE plans, no new SAR-SEP plans may be established after
December 31, 1996. Plans established by that date may be maintained under
current rules and additional employees may be added when they become eligible.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"> <FONT SIZE="+1"><B><FONT
COLOR="#000080">Greater Retirement Opportunities for Non-working Spouses</FONT></B></FONT><BR>Effective
January 1, 1997, an individual can make an IRA contribution of up to $2,000 for
him or herself and another IRA contribution of up to $2,000 (up from $250) for

  <HR>
<IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/strong/images/lisanti.jpg"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><B>August
6, 1996</B>.</FONT> Strong Capital Management, Inc., announced today that
Mary Lisanti will join the firm to run the Strong Small Cap Fund and develop
additional small- and mid-cap investment capabilities for the institutional
and financial intermediary marketplaces. Lisanti, 39, has been a managing
director at Bankers Trust in New York, where she was head of the small/mid-cap
equity team and portfolio manager of the BT Small Cap and Capital Appreciation
Funds. At Bankers Trust, she led a team responsible for managing over $2
billion in assets.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Mary Lisanti is the kind of extremely talented individual who can help shape
  our company's future," said Strong Chairman Richard S. Strong. "She has a
  time-tested investment process that will help us better serve our investors
  by diversifying the growth products we offer them."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Says Lisanti, "I am attracted to the fact that Strong's core business is
money management. This firm has made a huge investment in its future and
is well positioned to grow." Lisanti has more than 18 years of experience
with small and medium-sized companies, both as an analyst and as a portfolio
manager. At Bankers Trust, she ran the BT Investment Small Cap Fund (assets
$300 million) and the BT Investments Capital Appreciation and Equity Appreciation
Funds (assets $200 million). She also managed more than $1.5 billion in
institutional accounts and off-shore funds. Lisanti takes a disciplined approach
to small- and mid-cap stock investing. This approach includes a thematic
process to identify broad secular changes in society and a rigorous fundamental
analysis to find the companies that will ultimately benefit from these secular
trends. A key ingredient in her process is the sell discipline, which has
several components, including a valuation element in which stocks that have
price/earnings multiples exceeding their projected 12-month earnings growth
are culled from her portfolios. Prior to joining Bankers Trust, Lisanti spent
3 1/2 years at the Evergreen Funds, after 12 years as an emerging growth
stock analyst with several Wall Street firms. Her prior experience includes
senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers, where she was head of
the firm's small-capitalization stock investment strategy and research effort.
A native of Queens, N.Y., she graduated with honors from Princeton University
in 1978. She is a chartered financial analyst and a member of the New York
Society of Security Analysts and the Financial Analyst Federation. Charles
A. Paquelet, who ran the Strong Small Cap Fund since its inception on December
31, 1995, has been named co-manager of one of Strong's flagship growth funds,
the Strong Discovery Fund. Strong Capital Management, Inc., manages investments
for corporations, public employee retirement funds, endowments, foundations,
and Taft-Hartley plans. Strong is investment advisor to the 30 Strong mutual
funds and 7 variable annuity funds. Founded in 1974, Strong manages $20 billion
in assets. For more complete information on the Strong Small Cap Fund and
the Strong Discovery Fund, including management fees and expenses, please
call 1-800-368-3863. A prospectus can be ordered or downloaded at any time
by selecting the Request Info button below. Please read the prospectus carefully
before you invest or send money. Strong Funds Distributors, Inc.

<BR> Named after the section of the federal Internal Revenue Code that
authorizes this type of program, a 403(b) plan is a special tax-advantaged
retirement plan for employees of certain tax-exempt organizations and
educational institutions. Generally, a 403(b) plan can be either a 403(b)(1)
tax-sheltered annuity contract (TSA) issued by an insurer or a 403(b)(7)
custodial account invested exclusively in mutual fund shares. Either type of
403(b) plan allows you to make pre-tax contributions, taken from your paycheck,
to a special retirement annuity or custodial account set up specifically in your
name.<BR>
<BR> 403(b) plans are designed exclusively for employees of certain non-profit
organizations such as:<BR>
<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Educational institutions, including
colleges, universities, public and private schools, and technical and vocational
institutions.<BR>
<BR> A 403(b) plan is funded through a voluntary salary reduction agreement
between you and your organization. You decide how much you want to contribute to
your account and how often, subject to certain IRS limits. Then, the amount you
want to save is automatically deducted from your paycheck on a before-tax basis
and allocated to the investments you select. It's that simple.<BR>

<P>  </P>
<HR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="power">Retirement Planning
Power</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR> A 403(b) plan gives you the unique opportunity to accumulate substantially
greater savings than through comparable taxable investment. Here's why:<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"> <B><FONT COLOR="#000080"> You pay
yourself first.</FONT></B> Your 403(b)       contributions are automatically
withdrawn from your paycheck on a regular       basis -- you don't need to write
a check. And there's no burdensome paperwork       to worry about. You can relax
knowing that each pay period, investing for       your retirement is given the
priority it deserves.<BR>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"> You pay less in
current taxes.</FONT></B> When you       contribute to a 403(b) plan, you
actually lower your taxable income. That's       because your contributions are
deducted from your salary before taxes are       taken out. This will enable you
to pay taxes on a smaller portion of your       salary. And you pay no federal
income tax on your contributions until you       take a distribution, typically
at retirement. The result? It actually costs       you less to save. To
illustrate, assume you contribute $100 each month to       your retirement
account:   <BR>

<P><IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"> Your account

accumulate tax-deferred in your 403(b) account.       This means your 403(b)
earnings grow free from federal income taxation until       you withdraw them.
Over time, the additional earnings power of tax-deferred       compounding can
significantly increase the value of your retirement account.Of       course,
once you begin taking distributions from your 403(b) account, your      
withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.     </P>

Diversification</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR> Investment choices you make today will affect the type of retirement
you'll enjoy in the future. No single investment is right for everyone. Before
you select your 403(b) investments, you'll want to carefully consider how much
you want your investments to earn and how much risk you're willing to accept in
order to achieve those earnings. By spreading your 403(b) assets over a variety
of investments that have different return potentials and risk levels, you may be
able to reduce the impact a decline in any one investment may have on your
entire portfolio. As a result, diversification may also help increase your
portfolio's overall return potential over time.<BR>
<BR> Our sample <A HREF="/strong/Retirement/5pies.htm">five model portfolios</A>
are intended to illustrate how asset allocation can work for you. When comparing
asset allocation models to your personal financial situation, you should
consider all of your assets, income and investments, in addition to your
retirement assets.<BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="answers">Answers to
Commonly-Asked Questions</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Who is eligible to participate in a 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Generally, employees of public schools or tax-exempt organizations
described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are eligible to
participate in 403(b) plans. Employers that are qualified to sponsor 403(b)
plans include hospitals, health care organizations, churches and other religious
organizations, colleges, universities, public and private schools, and certain
other non-profit organizations. You should consult with your employer to
determine whether or not it is qualified to sponsor a 403(b) plan, and whether
you're eligible to participate.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What types of funding arrangements are available for 403(b) plans?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Two types of funding arrangements are most commonly used for 403(b)
plans: <B>(1)</B> 403(b)(1) annuity contracts issued by insurance companies;
and <B>(2)</B> 403(b)(7) custodial accounts invested exclusively in mutual
funds. Employers may make one or both types of 403(b) funding arrangements
available to their eligible employees. Many individuals select mutual funds for
their 403(b) accounts, however, because of the professional management,
diversification, liquidity, flexibility and convenience they offer investors.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What types of contributions may be made to a 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> You may make pre-tax &quot;elective deferral&quot; contributions to
your 403(b) plan in accordance with your salary reduction agreement. In
addition, your organization may make &quot;non-elective&quot; contributions to
your 403(b) plan. All contributions to your 403(b) plan &amp;endash; whether
salary reduction contributions or non-elective employer contributions &amp;endash;
will be excluded from your current year gross income for federal income tax
purposes, only if they do not exceed certain limitations established by the IRS.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: How much can I contribute to my 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Generally, the maximum amount that may be contributed to your 403(b)
account each year, and excluded from your current year's gross income for
federal income tax purposes, depends upon a number of factors, including prior
retirement plan contributions, compensation, and years of service. Generally,
for any tax year, contributions to your 403(b) account are excludable from your
federal gross income to the extent they do not exceed the smallest of the
following three limits, whichever applies: <B>(1)</B> the annual dollar limit
on elective deferrals ($9,500 for the 1996 tax year); <B>(2)</B> your &quot;exclusion
allowance&quot; for the year'; and <B>(3)</B> the overall limit on
contributions (generally, the lesser of $30,000 or 25% of your compensation for
the year). However, there are special &quot;catch-up&quot; elections that may
increase the $9,500 elective deferral limit in certain years. Please contact
either your tax advisor, or obtain IRS Publication 571, to determine your
maximum allowable contribution.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What happens if I contribute more than the allowable limit?</B><BR> A:
So-called &quot;excess elective deferrals&quot; (generally, salary reduction
contributions over $9,500 per year or, any higher limit under a special &quot;catch-up&quot;
election) are included in your federal gross income for the tax year in which
they were made. If the plan allows, you can withdraw the excess elective
deferrals (plus earnings) by April 15 of the following year. If you do, the
excess elective deferrals will not have to be included in your federal gross
income for the year of the distribution, but the distributed earnings must be
included. So-called &quot;excess contributions&quot; (i.e., salary reduction and
non-elective employer contributions that exceed applicable annual limitations)
are included in your federal gross income for the tax year in which they were
made, and the excess reduces your exclusion allowance for future years, even
though the excess has already been included in your income.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: How often can I change my contribution amount?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> According to IRS regulations which recently changed on January 1, 1996,
there is no limit to the number of times you may make or change your salary
reduction agreement.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Can I transfer my existing assets from another 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes. Generally speaking, you may transfer your existing 403(b) plan
assets to another 403(b) Retirement Plan without penalty, assuming your existing
plan and IRS rules permit transfers. You'll want to check with your organization
and tax advisor for additional details.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Can I also contribute to an IRA?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Absolutely, although you'll want to maximize your contributions to
your 403(b) plan first. You can only contribute up to a maximum of $2,000 (or
100% of compensation if less than $2,000) each year to an Individual Retirement
Account. However, your ability to deduct IRA contributions may be affected by
your (or your spouse's) participation in any other retirement plan. If you and
your spouse file a joint income tax return; have an adjusted gross income of
more than $40,000; and at least one of you is covered by a retirement plan, you
lose some or all of your IRA income tax deduction.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What if I change employers?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Because all pre-tax salary reduction contributions you make to your
403(b) account are 100% vested immediately, you may be able to continue making
such contributions to your 403(b) account by signing a new salary reduction
agreement with your new employer. If your new employer is not eligible to offer
a 403(b) plan, you can let your existing 403(b) account grow tax-deferred even
though you may not currently make contributions.<BR>

<B>A Guide to Lump-Sum Retirement Distributions</B>
</P>
<HR>

<PRE>

</PRE>
<P>

Congratulations! Your new job is likely to be an important step in your career. In the excitement and activity of changing companies, however, you may be missing a very important opportunity -- one you can't afford to overlook.
<P>
If you were a participant in your previous employer's qualified retirement plan, you may be eligible to receive a check for the savings you accumulated. What will you do with that &quot;lump-sum distribution?&quot; Even if the amount seems modest, what you saved or your employer contributed on your behalf still represents important assets you'll need for retirement -- assets you'll want to protect and grow. 
<P>
Yet many people are tempted to spend all or part of their distribution. Others, in the hustle and bustle of transition, don't give this important decision much thought. Either can be a costly mistake. Consider this:
<P>
<B>
<DL>
<DD>If you're planning to spend -- rather than roll over -- the payout from your qualified retirement plan, you could lose as much as half of your retirement nest egg to taxes and IRS penalties.</DD>
</DL>
</B>
<P>
That's why it's important to know the benefits of allowing whatever you've accumulated so far to continue growing tax-deferred. And why it's also important to know the tax rules associated with retirement-plan rollovers.
<P>

<P>A great way to begin your investment plan is by starting small. A program

portfolio if you make a monthly commitment and stick to it.<BR><BR>To see how

<HR>
<P>Whatever you choose to do with your money involves some element of risk.
What's important to keep in mind is that risk and reward go hand-in-hand. Low
risk investments tend to provide lower returns. Conversely, to achieve higher
rates of return, you must also accept a greater level of risk.
<BR>
<BR> To help you become clearer on the concept of risk we've listed five main
types of investment risk below. Risk can be different things to different
people, and what you perceive to be the riskiest choice may not be to someone
else. <BR>
<BR> After you've reviewed the different types of risk, take our
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Risk Tolerance Quiz</B></FONT> to see what type of risk
profile you have, and how you may want to allocate your portfolio based on it.
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1">1) Capital Risk</FONT></B><BR> Capital
risk is the risk most people think about when investing --  and its also the
most misunderstood. Capital risk is the danger that you'll lose the money that
you invest. It is the risk that most people mention when asked about their
concerns about investing. And even though millions of Americans make money
investing each year, some people choose not to invest simply because they worry
about losing their money in the stock or bond markets.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000080"><B>2) Market Risk</B></FONT><BR> Why do
people shy away from investing in stocks and bonds? The answer has more to do
with the second type of risk, market risk. It's the danger that you'll lose
money as a result of a steep market decline. The thought of an investment that
moves up and down in value can be unnerving, but market fluctuations are an
expected but unpleasant part of stock market behavior. Stock market volatility
can be unsettling, but in the long run, stocks have tended to outperform more
conservative investments. Of course, past performance cannot guarantee future
results.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">How can capital and market risk be reduced?
</FONT></B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/redball.jpg"><B> <FONT COLOR="#000000">Diversification.</FONT></B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/redball.jpg"> <B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Focusing on
the long term.</FONT></B> <BR> By owning different types of investments, you
may reduce the effect a downturn in one security will have on your overall
portfolio. Mutual funds themselves are diversified. We've developed
<A HREF="/strong/html/Retirement/5pies.ht1">five model strategies</A> to help
you consider how to allocate your own portfolio. Also keep the markets ups and
downs in perspective -- stay focused on the long term for your longer-term, more
aggressive investments.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1">3) Inflation Risk</FONT></B><BR> To avoid
the risks of losing money in the stock market, many people simply put their
savings in a local bank.* However, what's safe for the short-term can be
extremely risky over time. That brings up the third type of risk -- purchasing
power or inflation risk. If your investment goal is more than five years away,
inflation risk can be a serious danger to your savings.<BR>
<BR> Inflation or purchasing power risk is the chance that the value of your
money won't keep pace with inflation. Inflation is a constant, steady erosion of
your money's value. The amount of erosion varies -- in some years the rate of
inflation is higher than in others. But the effect of inflation is the same: as
the cost of living keeps going up, we all need more money just to stay even.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Protecting against inflation</FONT></B><BR>
<B>Invest for growth.</B>-- Putting your money in an investment whose price
doesn't fluctuate much may sound good, but many investors understand that while
market risk may be scary, over the long term inflation risk is the real threat
to their financial security. Some investors frequently choose investments that
historically have provided low returns because they feel another percent or two
just isn't worth the risk.<BR>
<BR> But consider what a difference a few percentage points can make over time.
The quiz below shows the effects of <B><FONT SIZE="+1">what a 2% difference in
your annualized returns</FONT></B> can make over time, assuming
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">$100 monthly contributions for a period of 20 years</FONT></B>,
including the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. Just select the
dollar amount you believe accumulated over the 20 year time period for each
respective annual return and hit submit to see the results: <BR>

<TITLE>Determining Your Tolerance for Risk</TITLE></HEAD>

<HR>
<P>Before you can invest successfully, it's important to correctly assess your
tolerance for risk. Ideally, determining how much risk you're willing to assume
enables you to invest for the highest possible return while remaining
comfortable with the volatility of your investments. Not finding the proper
balance can lead in either of two directions...<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/redball.jpg"> You may invest too
<I>aggressively</I> -- possibly prompting you to sell shares at a loss if your
fund's share price declines more sharply than you thought it might, or<BR>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/redball.jpg"> You may invest too
<I>conservatively</I> -- leading you to buy a fund that doesn't offer
sufficient return potential to meet your needs.<BR>
<BR> To help you begin to gain insight into your own attitudes toward risk and
investing, we've devised the following questionnaire. While it certainly is not
intended to be comprehensive, this profile can help you begin thinking about
what risks you are or aren't willing to take as you pursue your investment
goals. Remember to re-evaluate your financial goals regularly, or as your
circumstances change.<BR>
<BR>
</P>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/strong/perl/riskquiz1.pl">
<P>For the following questions, select the option that applies to you:<BR>

<P>If you have finally decided to plunge into the world of mutual funds but are
concerned about the ups and downs of the markets, making you unsure of <B><I>when</I></B>
to invest, an automatic investment plan offers you a solution.<BR><BR>At
Strong Funds, we use the term '<A HREF="/strong/LearningCenter/aipbroch.ht1">automatic
investment plan</A>' interchangeably with the phrase 'dollar-cost averaging'.
The concept is this: without trying to &quot;time&quot; the market you invest a
set dollar amount over time regardless of market conditions. It helps you escape
the guessing game of &quot;how to avoid a market correction&quot; or of
calculating when to &quot;buy low and sell high.&quot;<BR><BR>Using this
approach, purchases of the same dollar amount are invested at regular intervals
(for example, monthly). Why might this be a potential benefit to investors? The
following tool allows you to see what happens to your investments regardless of
market conditions. Enter the fixed dollar amount you plan to invest monthly. The
outputs will show you how your hypothetical investment would perform under three
different types of market conditions:</P>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"> A fluctuating market (share prices are increasing and decreasing)<P>

<IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"> A rising market (share prices are steadily increasing)<P>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"> A declining market (share prices are steadily declining)

<P>A program of regular investment cannot assure a profit nor protect against a
loss in a declining market and, since such a program involves continuous
investment regardless of fluctuating share values, you should consider your own
ability to continue the program through periods of all market cycles.<BR></P>

The <B> <FONT COLOR="000080">Strong Heritage Money Fund</FONT></B> seeks
current income, a stable share price, and daily liquidity. The Fund invests
in corporate, bank, and government instruments that present minimal credit
risk. Designed to provide a yield that, over time, is higher than typical
money funds, the Fund is structured to keep costs low. The Fund requires
investors to maintain account balances of at least $25,000, enabling it to
take advantage of certain economies of scale. With certain exceptions, the
Fund also charges fees for individual transactions. <BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1><I> Please note: an investment in the Fund is neither insured
nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, and there can be no assurance that
the Fund will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per
share.</I></FONT>

The Strong Growth Fund seeks capital growth. The Fund invests in stocks that
its manager believes offer above-average growth potential at a reasonable
price. In general, the Fund seeks companies that, regardless of size, have
powerful earnings growth stemming from robust expansion, market dominance,
accelerating sales and proven management. <BR>

The <B><FONT COLOR="000080"> Strong Small Cap Fund</FONT></B> seeks capital
growth. The Fund invests primarily in the stocks of companies that have small
market capitalizations, which we generally define as $2 billion or less at
the time of the Fund's investment.
<P>
<I>Please note: While investments in smaller-capitalization companies may
offer greater return potential, they often involve greater risks than investments
in established companies.</I>

The <B><FONT COLOR="000080">Strong Government Securities Fund </FONT></B>
seeks total return by investing for a high level of current income with a
moderate degree of share-price fluctuation. The Fund normally invests at
least 80% of its total assets in U.S. government securities. To enhance yield
and total-return potential, the Fund's manager carefully calibrates the
portfolio's maturity, extending maturity in favorable markets to pursue higher
returns and shortening its maturity when a more defensive positioning seems
warranted.<BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=-1>Please note that Fund's shares are neither insured nor
guaranteed by the U.S. government.<BR>

The <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Strong High-Yield Bond Fund</FONT></B> seeks
total return by investing for a high level of current income and capital
growth. The Fund is designed for investors who want to pursue higher income
than higher-quality bonds generally provide and who are willing to accept
increased share-price fluctuation in pursuit of that goal. To help manage
the credit risk associated with lower-quality bonds, the Fund's manager is
highly selective, utilizing stringent credit analysis to identify bonds for
the portfolio.<BR>

The <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Strong Short-Term Global Bond Fund</FONT></B>
seeks total return by investing for a high level of income with a low degree
of share-price fluctuation. In pursuit of this objective, the Fund invests
primarily in investment-grade bonds of U.S. and foreign issuers. Although
the Fund's holdings normally will be spread among a variety of countries
and currencies, at least 35% of its holdings will remain invested in the
U.S. market. To further limit the effect of foreign currency movements, the
Fund's managers will employ currency-hedging techniques.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1> <I>Please note that this Fund is "non-diversified," meaning,
it is able to concentrate its holdings more than a similar, diversified fund.
While this approach enhances return potential, it may also magnify
risk.</I></FONT>

The <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Strong International Bond Fund </FONT></B>seeks
high total return by investing for both income and capital appreciation.
It pursues this objective by searching the globe for attractive combinations
of current yields and relative investment value. The Fund will normally invest
at least 65% of its total assets in investment-grade securities of issuers
in at least three countries.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1><I>Please note that this Fund is "non-diversified," meaning,
it is able to concentrate its holdings more than a similar, diversified fund.
While this approach enhances return potential, it may also magnify risk.
Furthermore, the Fund is primarily unhedged against currency fluctuations,
which may also lead to increased volatility </I></FONT> <BR>

<I> <FONT size=2>Morningstar's proprietary ratings reflect historical
risk-adjusted performance and are subject to change every month. Overall
ratings are calculated from a fund's 3- and 5-year (not 1-year) average annual
total returns in excess of 90-day Treasury bill returns with appropriate
fee adjustments and a risk factor that reflects fund performance below 90-day
T-bill returns. 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars,
22.5% receive 4 stars, 35% receive 3 stars, 22.5% receive 2 stars, and 10%
receive 1 star. There were 1739, 1074, and 569 funds in Morningstar's Municipal
category for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended 11-30-96, respectively.

<P>To provide you with investment flexibility, Strong offers more than 29 funds
to help meet a variety of investment needs, from money market funds to
aggressive growth funds. Every fund in the Strong Family is <I>100% no-load</I>.
You pay no commissions to purchase, exchange, or redeem your shares. There are
no annual 12b-1 fees, either.<BR><BR>The Funds below are listed in order of
risk/return potential.</P>

most people understand what is meant by &quot;return,&quot; &quot;risk&quot; is
a more complex topic. &quot;Risk&quot; means the potential loss of principal
invested in a fund. Thus, while the potential risk associated with our Money
Market Funds is expected to be relatively low, the potential risk associated
with our Growth Funds is expected to be relatively high -- and our Income Funds
and Conservative Equity Funds fall in between.<BR><BR><BR><B>*</B>A
portfolio diversified with international mutual funds can offer the potential
for higher returns, but also entails special risks. These risks include currency
fluctuations, political and economic instability, and illiquid markets. The
value of the Funds' investments and their share prices will vary from day to day
in response to these factors. These risks are intensified in emerging markets.
The risks involved with international investing can be reduced by professional
management and broad diversification, but cannot be eliminated.</P></BODY></HTML>

<B>This month's question:</B> With the market near its all-time high, should
I wait before I buy shares of a stock fund?
<P>
<BR>
<B>Respondent: &nbsp;</B>Richard Weiss, portfolio co-manager of the
<A HREF="/strong/Our_Funds/Growth_Funds/oppprfl.ht1__1-14">Strong Opportunity
Fund</A> and the Strong
<A HREF="/strong/Our_Funds/Growth_Funds/commprfl.ht1__1-14">Common Stock
Fund</A>.
<P>
"It's understandable why you might feel uneasy about investing in stock funds
when the market is near its all-time high. But trying to predict the market's
short-term direction is next to impossible - nobody we know has been consistently
successful at it. Moreover, being out of the market and missing a rally can
be as detrimental to investment performance as being in the market during
a correction. That's why, if you're an investor seeking growth over the
longer-term - "longer term" meaning more than five years - we believe it's
best to stay invested. You can help take the pain out of downturns by
diversifying your portfolio to include a variety of different stock funds.
In addition, you might increase your peace of mind by purchasing a fund run
by experienced managers who've learned how to add value during difficult
markets. What's most important to remember is, while stocks will always be
volatile, investors have historically been most successful if they formulate
a solid plan, and then stick to that plan over the long term."

<I> <FONT size=2>Morningstar's proprietary ratings reflect historical
risk-adjusted performance and are subject to change every month. Overall
ratings are calculated from a fund's 3- and 5-year (not 1-year) average annual
total returns in excess of 90-day Treasury bill returns with appropriate
fee adjustments and a risk factor that reflects fund performance below 90-day
T-bill returns. 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars,
22.5% receive 4 stars, 35% receive 3 stars, 22.5% receive 2 stars, and 10%
receive 1 star. There were 2907, 1769, and 1042 funds in Morningstar's Domestic
Equity category for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended 11-30-96,
respectively. </FONT></I>

"Hello. &nbsp;This is Dick Weiss, portfolio co-manager of the Strong Opportunity
Fund. &nbsp;Thank you for visiting the Strong Funds web site, and for your
interest in Strong Funds. &nbsp;Marina Carlson and I manage the Opportunity
Fund according to a "private value" approach. &nbsp;Put simply, that means
we estimate what a company would be worth if it were acquired, and use that
estimate as a yardstick to assess if that company's stock is attractively
priced. &nbsp;Typically, we concentrate on the stocks of medium-sized company,
which we believe offer an opportunity for strong growth. &nbsp;You might
want to consider the Opportunity Fund if you are pursuing growth for an
investment goal that is more than five years away, such as building assets
for retirement or financing a child's college education. &nbsp;To learn more,

<P></P>
<H1 ALIGN="Center">  <B>UGMA/UTMA: An Odd Name for a Great College Savings
Plan</B>      </H1>
<HR>
<P>Raising children today is hard enough -- even if you don't have any
financial concerns. But most parents do have financial concerns. Daycare,
medical expenses, all the special things you'd like to give your children --
and, then there's college.
</P>
<P>Estimates of how much college will cost 10 or 20 years from now vary, and
some of the estimates are downright frightening. But parents willing to start
early will find that saving for college -- like any other long-term financial
goal -- is possible if you have a plan and use the right tools.
</P>
<P>Strong offers such a tool -- commonly called an UGMA or UTMA account -- that
can help you set aside money for education or any of your child's other needs.
The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act and the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act allow
you to open an account in a child's name, and may provide you with tax
advantages.
</P>
<P><B>Start Early . . .</B>
</P>
<P>Kate and Mark Greer, of Colorado, opened an UTMA shortly after their
daughter Sarah was born 18 months ago. Legally, the account is in Sarah's name
but the Greers can control the assets until Sarah turns 21.
<FONT SIZE="-1">1</FONT>
</P>
<P>&quot;We feel strongly about Sarah going to college, and we'd like to give
her the opportunity to go without taking out loans,&quot; said Kate Greer. &quot;In
order to do that, we knew we'd have to do better than the meager returns we were
getting on CDs at the bank.&quot; Which is what led the Greers to start thinking
about investing in mutual funds, and eventually, to opening an UTMA account.
<FONT SIZE="-1">2</FONT>
</P>
<P><B>...And Add Often</B>
</P>
<P>Kate and Mark got a head start by opening the account with $2,000, and they
decided to continue to invest regularly in the account in order to help reach
their goal.
</P>
<P>Fortunately, an UTMA may offer tax advantages that can add some extra money
to the Greer's bottom line -- savings they could invest in this account. The
first $650 of income from an UTMA account is tax-free, and the next $650 is
taxable at Sarah's rate. (For most minors 15%.) Only income above $1,300 would
be taxed at the Greer's higher rate. And, after she turns 14, all of the income
from the UTMA will be taxed at Sarah's rate.
<FONT SIZE="-1">3</FONT>
</P>
<P>&quot;Like a lot of other parents, we read articles about the spiraling cost
of college tuition, and I have to admit, the figures are intimidating,&quot;
said Kate. &quot;But we feel confident that we'll be able to handle it because
we've started so early.&quot;

<HR>
<P><B>Choosing an Appropriate Investment</B>
</P>
<P>While CDs may be appropriate for a portion of the Greers' portfolio, they
have increased the potential for higher returns in Sarah's account by investing
it in a growth fund, which invests primarily in stocks.
</P>
<P>&quot;We chose a growth fund because we believe stock funds have a better
chance to grow over time, and we have a long time to let this investment grow,&quot;
Kate said. Their longer time frame allows the Greers to invest more aggressively
now in a stock fund -- which is more volatile than a bond fund or money market
fund. Their decision to invest in a stock mutual fund was a personal one, and
you should consider your own financial situation, risk tolerance, and time frame
when making an investment.
</P>
<P>As Sarah nears college age, the Strong UTMA offers the flexibility to move
the assets to a more conservative fund in order to moderate potential risk.
However, moving assets from one fund to another in an UGMA/UTMA account could
result in a taxable event. You may want to consult a tax advisor to evaluate
your personal tax situation before opening an account.

<P></P>
<P><B>Keep These Things in Mind</B>
</P>
<P>There are a couple of other things to consider when you open a custodial
account. First, your child will gain legal control of the assets when he or she
reaches a certain age (18 or 21 in most states). You relinquish control of the
assets at that time, and there's no guarantee the money will be spent on college
tuition.
</P>
<P>Money you put in an UGMA/UTMA is an irrevocable gift to the minor. The
assets legally belong to the minor and have to be used for his or her benefit --
you can't change your mind later on and take the money out.
</P>
<P>You'll also want to keep in mind that any assets held in a child's name
could limit the child's eligibility for financial aid, because colleges take
those assets into account when determining your family's need for assistance.
</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">1 The age at which custodians must relinquish control

SIZE="+1">&quot;Eat your broccoli,&quot; your Mom told you, &quot;it's good for
you.&quot; Of course, she was right. And today, you still try to eat your
broccoli, even if you don't really enjoy it. Why? Because you expect it to pay
off over the long run in the form of better health. And that's exactly the same
reason why you should consider an Automatic Investment Plan (AIP).</FONT>
</P>
<P>Like broccoli, there's nothing glamorous about an AIP. But there are few
better ways to improve the health of your overall investment strategy. An AIP
enables you to automatically transfer a pre-set amount of money from your bank
account into the Strong funds you choose at regular intervals. You determine how
much you want to invest (as little as $50), and how often. Once you start your
plan, it continues automatically, so you work toward your goals step by step,
consistently, over time.
</P>
<P><B>An AIP offers important advantages</B>
</P>
<P><I>You &quot;Pay yourself first.&quot; </I>Because it's automatic, an AIP
ensures that you attend to your long-term goals before you're tempted to spend
those assets on a new suit or a set of golf clubs. With an AIP, investing for
your future is built into your budget, just as your monthly bills are. As a
result, you're much more likely to stick with your plan. It's a great way to
save three years for a down payment on a house, or 30 years for retirement.
</P>
<P><I>You don't put off investing.</I> It's easy to delay investing until you
believe the time is &quot;right.&quot; But doing so means you're not utilizing
one of the most potent benefits of long-term investing: the power of
compounding. When you reinvest your dividends and capital gains, they add
considerably to the growth potential of your investment over time. And the
longer you invest, the greater the effect of compounding becomes:

<P></P>
<P><I>Volatile markets are less worrisome. </I>When the markets are volatile,
an AIP can help you invest with less anxiety, because you're only buying a
little at a time. In fact, when you invest the same amount in a fund at regular
intervals, you buy more shares when the price is lower. Thus, market
fluctuations actually help reduce your average cost per share over time.
Experiment with our <A HREF="/strong/LearningCenter/dcacalc.ht1">Dollar-Cost
Averaging Calculator </A>&nbsp;to see how changing market conditions can impact
your monthly investment. Keep in mind, however, that regular investing can't
guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. So choose an
amount that suits your budget, regardless of market conditions.

Which approach is right for you: "Growth"
  or "Value?"
</H1>
<P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>David had his Goliath. Muhammad Ali had his Frazier. And
so, too, do investors have their nemesis: risk. And to make matters even
more difficult, investors typically must use the most volatile asset class
&endash; stocks &endash; to pursue important goals that are more than five
years away, such as retirement or college tuition for children.</B></FONT>
  <HR>
<P>
Stocks tend to be the investment of choice because, historically, they have
been far more effective than bonds or cash at providing the powerful returns
needed to overcome inflation and build wealth over time.
<P>
To a large extent, more risk is the price you pay to pursue greater returns.
However, if you're investing for the long-term and want to emphasize stocks
in your portfolio, you may still help lessen volatility by diversifying with
different types of stocks. Specifically, you can include both major styles
of stock investing: "growth" and "value."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Two contrasting investment styles</B></FONT>
<P>
As their names imply, growth-style investors and value-style investors emphasize
"growth" stocks and "value" stocks, respectively. What's the difference between
the two? In the simplest terms, "growth" and "value" stocks differ based
on how much the market is willing to pay for them.
<P>
<B>Growth stocks</B> tend to carry high price tags relative to what they
are currently earning. The market is willing to pay more for them because
they're from leading companies with the potential for powerful, consistent
earnings growth, and may therefore be worth considerably more in the future.
The job of growth stock managers is to determine if a stock's price is justified,
based on the company's potential for expansion.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<FONT SIZE="5"><IMG SRC="/strong/images/stock.jpg" ALT="Roads"></FONT>
<P>
<B>Value stocks</B>, on the other hand, tend to be inexpensive based on various
measures of their value, such as current earnings or total assets. The market
isn't willing to pay more for them because they're from companies that are
out of favor for some reason. The job of value managers is to identify companies
poised for a turnaround, leading to rising earnings and higher stock prices.
<P>
  <HR>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>By diversifying into both "value" and "growth" stocks, you may lessen
your portfolio's overall risk while retaining the growth potential of
equities.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
  <HR>
<P>
Both styles have their proponents, but neither has been shown to provide
consistently higher returns than the other. What's important for stock investors
to know is that both styles tend to run in cycles. One style may be in favor
for a couple of years while the other is out of favor. So diversifying to
include both among your stock holdings may help reduce the overall volatility
of your portfolio over time, as you can see in the chart below.

select. Both indices are selected form the Russell 2000&reg; Index, which
generally represents the U.S. stock market and includes reinvestment of dividends
and capital gains. "Risk" is represented in terms of volatility as measured
by standard deviation, which indicates the amount of change on either side
of the mean for the time period shown. Index performance is historical and
does not represent future results or the performance of any Strong Fund.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>The bottom line: consider both</FONT></B>
<P>
It's important to remember that, regardless of whether the stocks you invest
in are value or growth, they're still stocks. That means they'll be volatile
over shorter time periods. But if you're a long-term investor who needs the
growth potential of stocks in your portfolio, diversifying with both types
can give you access to that potential, and may help limit volatility.

<I><B>Growth Stocks</B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="5"><IMG SRC="/strong/images/ognar1.jpg" ALT="Ron Ognar"></FONT>
<P>
Ronald C. Ognar, Portfolio Manager of the Strong Growth Fund
<P>
<B><I>On growth stocks:</I></B> "Growth stocks represent companies that can
increase earnings very rapidly. And because stock performance tends to follow
earnings growth, growth stock prices can rise quickly, too. These are the
firms that are doing everything right. They typically enjoy strong sales
growth, a dominant market position, a healthy balance sheet, excellent product
development capability, and talented management with a definite vision of
where they want to go and how they plan to get there. Growth stocks can come
from companies of all sizes, in any industry, both domestically and
internationally."
<P>
<B><I>On growth stock investing:</I></B> "With growth stocks, you're dealing
with high-quality companies. So it's not a guessing game as to whether they
will increase earnings. The question is how much, and how consistently. So
we do a lot of fundamental, 'bottom-up' research -- including on-site visits
and meetings with management -- to get a handle on how well the company is
put together. Then, we project earnings for the company over the upcoming
five-year period to evaluate whether the stock's price is currently overvalued
or undervalued. We do the same with companies we already own. If they don't
meet our earnings estimates or become too richly priced, we'll likely sell
and look for a more attractive investment. That's because, to us, the key
to success with growth stocks is to be picky . . . to not just buy growth
stocks, but buy them at a reasonable price."
<P>
<P>
<B><I>Value Stocks</I></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="5"><IMG SRC="/strong/images/schafer1.jpg" ALT="David Schafer"></FONT>
<P>
David Schafer, Portfolio Manager of the Strong Schafer Value Fund
<P>
<B><I>On value stocks:</I></B> "Value stocks occupy the 'discount bin' of
the stock market. They tend to trade at low valuations versus the market,
based on the issuing company's earnings, book value, assets, etc. They trade
at a discount to the market because the market believes there's no compelling
reason to buy them. While that belief is often valid, there are enough exceptions
-- when attractive opportunities are trading at a discount -- to make investing
in these stocks worthwhile."
<P>
<B><I>On value stock investing:</I></B> "Value stock investing is all about
attempting to take advantage of these apparent misvaluations. So rigorous
research is a must. You have to scour balance sheets and annual reports and
income statements, all with an eye toward spotting the company that offers
potential value that isn't yet reflected in its stock price. And you have
to have certain criteria that helps you decide which stocks to buy. For us,
that means a stock must have elements of both 'value' and 'growth,' with
price-to-earnings ratios that are less than that of the S&amp;P 500, but
earnings-per-share growth prospects over the next 2-3 years that are superior
to the growth rate projected for the S&amp;P 500. In short, we look for
above-average earnings growth in a stock selling at a discount versus the
market."

<P>  </P>
<HR><IMG SRC="/strong/images/tankb.jpg" ALT="Brad Tank">
<P>There's been a lot of research done on this subject, some of it politically
motivated, some of it more objective. And undeniably, there has been a link
between the stock market's performance and the presidential election cycle --
over the last 50 years, none of the 13 bear market lows have occurred in an
election year.*
</P>
<P>However, suggesting that this cycle is a direct result of manipulation by
politicians is somewhat spurious. In fact, as Bill Clinton's 1992 election
campaign advice to himself -- &quot;It's the economy, stupid&quot; -- suggests,
the overall health of the economy appears to have far more impact on election
outcomes than does any tinkering on the part of the government.
</P>
<P>For example, during the ten presidential election years since 1956, the Fed
raised interest rates six times just prior to the election. More often than not,
the incumbent party won, which suggests that a strong economy more than offset
the negative effects of Fed tightening. Ironically, the four times the Fed cut
rates just prior to an election, the incumbent party has lost 75% of the time.
Again, perhaps a weaker economy overwhelmed the positive effects of Fed easing.
</P>
<P>Regardless, while the relationship between market cycles and presidential
election cycles is interesting, it certainly shouldn't serve as the basis for
altering a carefully-devised, long-term investment plan.

<P>
</B>Lots of people wonder why such a funny name -- 401(k) -- has been attached to such a popular plan for building 
retirement nest eggs. <P>
<P>
401(k) retirement savings programs were named for the 
section of the Internal Revenue Code that created them. 
Because Section 401(k) allowed employees to reduce 
their salaries and have the deferred amounts contributed 
to a retirement plan instead, these programs became 
known as 401(k) plans.<P>


<br><B>Turn Your Retirement Dreams Into Reality</B><BR><P>
Contributing to a 401(k) retirement savings program can 
help you build the financial security that will allow you 
to pursue your retirement dreams:<p>
<ul>
<li>Spend time with your family and friends.
<li>Pursue the leisure activities you enjoy.
<li>Afford travel across the country or around the world.
</ul><p>

<TITLE>THREE GOOD REASONS (AT LEAST) TO START YOUR 401(K) TODAY</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/strong/images/ihn_back.jpg" LINK="#800000" VLINK="#000080" ALINK="#FFFF00">
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=/strong/images/Retirement/3reasons.jpg>
</CENTER>

<P>
</B>Most of us expect to receive more than a gold watch 
when we retire. Yet it's going to take more than a 
handshake and a Seiko to support you once you stop 
working. That's one good reason to start saving for 
retirement today with the 401(k) program your company 
offers. Read on for more.<B><P>

Three Good Reasons To Participate In Your Company's 
401(k)<P></B>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/one.gif>
<B>You build retirement savings</B>. By participating in 
your company's plan, you guarantee that investing for 
your future is a given priority. This will help you build 
your retirement account steadily - without being sidetracked 
by short-term obligations.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/two.gif>
<B>You pay less taxes.</B> Because your contributions are 
made with pre-tax dollars, you don't pay income taxes 
on the money you contribute to your 401(k). That means 
every dollar you contribute reduces your taxable income 
and your current tax bill as well. The result? It actually 
costs you less to save.<p>

When you retire, you may be able to further defer taxes 
on your retirement savings while you continue to reap 
the benefits of tax-deferred compounding by using a 
direct rollover to an IRA or other qualified retirement 
plan. Of course, you will be taxed when you begin taking 
distributions.<P>

To illustrate, assume you contribute $100 each month 
to your retirement account:<BR><P>

<CENTER> <IMG SRC="/strong/images/Retirement/costs.jpg"></CENTER>

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=-1>Assumptions: Married person, filing jointly, earning 
$30,000 annually and paying federal taxes at the 15% 
tax bracket. State tax is not considered in this example.<P></I></FONT>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/three.gif>

<B>Your savings grow faster</B>. You don't pay income taxes 
on the earnings generated by your 401(k) investments. 
As a result, your earnings grow free from current taxes 
until you withdraw them. Over time, tax-deferred compounding 
can make a dramatic difference. <P>
Your company's retirement plan may permit after-tax 
contributions, which allow you to build even more assets 
for retirement. Although these contributions have already 
been taxed, the income they generate still grows and 
compounds, tax-deferred, until withdrawn at retirement.<B><P>


<BR><P><CENTER>
The Power of Tax-Deferred Compounding</B><P></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/strong/images/Retirement/taxdef.jpg"></CENTER>
<BR>
<I>Assumes monthly contribution of $100, reinvestment of all dividends
			 and capital gains, and a 36% federal income tax bracket. The 8% hypothetical annual 
			 return is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent
			 the return of any specific investment.</I><P>
     
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/strong/images/Retirement/color1.jpg">
Tax-Deferred Savings:  Total growth of investment with tax-deferral and compounding.<P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/strong/images/Retirement/color2.jpg">
Non-Deferred Savings:  Total growth of investment with no tax-deferral.<P>
  <IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/strong/images/Retirement/color3.jpg">
Total Set Aside:  Total pre-tax contributions set aside over 30 years at $100 per month.  (No investment income)<P>
<P>

<BR>
<B>Three More Good Reasons<P></B>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/one.gif>
<B>You're in control</B>. You decide how much to contribute 
to your company's retirement plan and how often. You 
choose where to invest your money from a menu of carefully 
selected investment choices. And as your income increases 
or your lifestyle permits, you can increase your contribution 
level.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/two.gif>
<B>You conveniently save before you spend.</B> Since your 
401(k) contributions are automatically withdrawn from 
your paycheck on a regular basis, you don't need to 
write a check, find an envelope or lick a stamp. And 
there's no burdensome paperwork to worry about. You 
can relax knowing that each pay period, you're &quot;paying 
yourself first.&quot;<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=/strong/images/three.gif>
<B>You can sock away more than your IRA.</B> Contributing 
to an Individual Retirement Account is a good way to 
build retirement assets. However, you're limited to 
setting aside only $2,000 a year. Compare that with 
the $9,500 (the current maximum allowed) you can contribute 
annually to your 401(k) plan. And if you contribute 
to an IRA and your company 401(k), you can really boost 
your tax-deferred savings.

<title>Investment Choices for the 21st Century</title>
<BODY BACKGROUND="/strong/images/ihn_back.jpg" LINK="#800000" VLINK="#000080" ALINK="#FFFF00">

<IMG SRC="/strong/images/Retirement/choices.jpg">
</center><hr>


<br>Participating in your company's 401(k) retirement
savings program is an important first step toward achieving
your retirement dreams.  <B>Choosing the right investments is 
the next.</B> That's because your investment choices today will
impact the type of retirement you will enjoy in the next 
century. <p>
The most common investment options fall into two 
main categories:<p>

<BR><P>
<B>You May Choose From Ownership Investments...</B><p>
 
Stocks, or equity investments, represent ownership in 
a company. Stocks offer you the opportunity for both 
dividends (your share of the company's profits) and 
capital appreciation (the growth in value of your shares), 
but their value will fluctuate over time.<p>
When investing for long-term growth, common stocks have
historically been investment champions. If you had placed 
$1 into a broad-based group of stocks represented by the 
Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index at the end of 1925 and 
reinvested all of your dividends, despite market ups and 
downs, your $1 investment would have grown to $803.11 
by the end of 1994, a span of 69 years. <p>
If you had invested your $1 in more stable Treasury bills 
instead, your investment would have grown to only $10.23.<p>

<I><FONT SIZE=-1>The Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index is 
an unmanaged index generally representative of the U.S. Stock 
Market.  Treasury bills are represented by returns of 91-day 
U.S. Treasury bills which are insured by the U.S. government 
as to principal and interest.  Past performance does not represent
future results.<p></I></FONT>

<BR><P>
<B>...Or From Loaner-Ship Investments</B>.<p> 

Fixed-income investments are simply debt obligations 
(loans) of a company or government. They pay a fixed-income 
rate over a set period of time. Because their value tends 
to fluctuate less than stocks, they generally appeal to 
more conservative investors. <p> 
Bonds, which represent loans to corporations as well as 
the U.S. government and municipalities, will fluctuate in
value as interest rates change. Money market securities 
(certificates of deposit, Treasury bills, commercial 
paper, etc.) which represent very short-term loans to 
banks, corporations and governments are more predictable 
investments than stocks or bonds. Still, the exact amount 
of interest they generate will fluctuate over time. 
Guaranteed investment contracts, which are sponsored by 
insurance companies, guarantee the payment of interest 
and return of principal, much like a certificate of deposit.
However, unlike CDs they are not federally insured.<p> 
No single investment is right for everyone. That's why your 
company's 401(k) retirement savings program offers you a 
variety of carefully selected investment options. You can 
pick the investment or combination of investments that 
best fits your particular needs, goals and objectives.

<CENTER><P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I>Strong Funds' Rochelle Lamm Wallach discusses </I></B></P>
</CENTER><CENTER><P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I>common mistakes made by retirement investors.</I></B></P>
</CENTER><HR>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">I've seen the same mistakes, time and again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">And again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">And again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">People regularly make the kind of mistakes with their retirement plans that
can tarnish their golden years. And they pay for it dearly. I serve as president
of Strong Advisory Services, the unit of Strong Capital Management dedicated
to serving <A HREF="/strong/Retirement/invwrk.ht1">401(k)</A> and other retirement plans. In my experience, having a plan, setting goals,
and being disciplined about investing regularly is a formula for success.
You have to make your retirement a priority.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">And to increase your chances of success, retirement investors should avoid
the following &quot;Don'ts&quot;:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4">
<IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/strong/images/1.jpg" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT
="42"><B>Don't think with a social security mind set.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">You need to have a &quot;self&quot; security mentality. If you are close to retirement,
Social Security may be there for you. But a lot of financial experts caution
that there is a significant chance that it will not provide a comfortable
safety net. When it comes to your retirement, pull yourself up by your own
bootstraps. You should be prepared to stand on your own two feet and save
everything you are going to need to support your retirement lifestyle.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/strong/images/2.jpg" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT
="42"><B>Don't continue your consumption binge!</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">In the last year, you bought a new TV. You traded in your car for the sports
utility vehicle. You upgraded your computer. And you took two week-long
vacations to warm climates. The way to start saving is to look carefully
at your spending habits and be honest with yourself about how much you are
spending on luxuries that may impair your retirement.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/strong/images/3.jpg" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT
="42"><B>Don't procrastinate.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">The quicker you start saving for your retirement the better. It is much
easier to start a savings program when you are young and have few financial
commitments. Its harder to start when you are older and have a home, children
and responsibilities which cause you to spend your money on &quot;necessities.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/strong/images/4.jpg" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT
="42"><B>Don't underestimate the power of compounding.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">Compounding could be considered the eighth wonder of the world. If you start
early, your money has more time to compound. Consider this, if you saved
one dollar a day for 30 years and it earned 8%, you'd have over $45,000.
That's the same as putting away the cost of a cup of coffee or a donut each
day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/strong/images/5.jpg" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT
="42"><B>Don't forget to save all you can with pretax dollars.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">Putting money into a 401(k) - or an <A HREF="/strong/Retirement/iras.ht1">IRA</A> - where you don't pay taxes immediately makes sense. Not only does your
money go directly to work for you since no taxes are withdrawn, your money
also compounds tax deferred. Your $100 monthly investment in a taxable account
earning 8% over 30 years grows to $54,463. The total you set aside is $36,000.
The same monthly investment into a tax-deferred account grows to $149,112.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/strong/images/6.jpg" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT
="42"><B>Don't forget to consider inflation. </B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">Too many people greatly underestimate how bad inflation is, even when it
is low. If inflation maintains a moderate 4% pace, in thirty years you will
need $324 to purchase what $100 can buy today. Be sure to be realistic about
your inflation estimates when you consider what you are going to need to
retire.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/strong/images/7.jpg" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT
="42"><B>Don't be afraid of the wrong risks.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">Most people investing for retirement are concerned about capital risk, the
risk of losing money in a stock or stock mutual fund if prices fluctuate.
As a result, many people invest too conservatively. Probably more damaging
is purchasing power risk, the risk that inflation will erode your ability
to afford the things you will need. To reach your long-term investment goals,
you should consider investing a portion of your portfolio in stocks, which
have historically outperformed inflation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/strong/images/8.jpg" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT
="42"><B>Don't make uninformed decisions.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">Do you spend more time researching the purchase of a sofa or a lawn mower
than researching your 401(k) investment choices? You're not alone. Its important
to take enough time to learn about what you are investing in so you make
the right long term decisions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/strong/images/9.jpg" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT
="42"><B>Don't blow your retirement savings when you leave a job.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">A July 1995 U.S. Department of Labor study found that 68% of the people
who are over 40 and make <A HREF="/strong/Retirement/lumps.ht1">job changes</A> fail to roll over their retirement fund into their next employer's 401(k)
or into an IRA. Fully 84% of those under 40 fail to roll over their retirement
nest egg. Its tempting to take the retirement money you've accumulated and
buy a boat, but you are jeopardizing your future by doing so.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/strong/images/10.jpg" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT
="42"><B>Don't blow a sure 50% return on your money.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">Most employers (84%) match the money you put away in your 401(k) retirement
plan (usually 50 cents on every dollar you put away up to 6% of your income).
By not contributing 6% of your income, you miss out on a guaranteed 50%
addition to your investment.</FONT></P>

<BR> Named after the section of the federal Internal Revenue Code that
authorizes this type of program, a 403(b) plan is a special tax-advantaged
retirement plan for employees of certain tax-exempt organizations and
educational institutions. Generally, a 403(b) plan can be either a 403(b)(1)
tax-sheltered annuity contract (TSA) issued by an insurer or a 403(b)(7)
custodial account invested exclusively in mutual fund shares. Either type of
403(b) plan allows you to make pre-tax contributions, taken from your paycheck,
to a special retirement annuity or custodial account set up specifically in your
name.<BR>
<BR> 403(b) plans are designed exclusively for employees of certain non-profit
organizations such as:<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Hospitals and health care organizations<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Charitable and other foundations<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Educational institutions, including
colleges, universities, public and private schools, and technical and vocational
institutions.<BR>
<BR> A 403(b) plan is funded through a voluntary salary reduction agreement
between you and your organization. You decide how much you want to contribute to
your account and how often, subject to certain IRS limits. Then, the amount you
want to save is automatically deducted from your paycheck on a before-tax basis
and allocated to the investments you select. It's that simple.<BR>

<HR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="power">Retirement Planning
Power</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR> A 403(b) plan gives you the unique opportunity to accumulate substantially
greater savings than through comparable taxable investment. Here's why:<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"> <B><FONT COLOR="#000080"> You pay
yourself first.</FONT></B> Your 403(b)       contributions are automatically
withdrawn from your paycheck on a regular       basis -- you don't need to write
a check. And there's no burdensome paperwork       to worry about. You can relax
knowing that each pay period, investing for       your retirement is given the
priority it deserves.<BR>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"> You pay less in
current taxes.</FONT></B> When you       contribute to a 403(b) plan, you
actually lower your taxable income. That's       because your contributions are
deducted from your salary before taxes are       taken out. This will enable you
to pay taxes on a smaller portion of your       salary. And you pay no federal
income tax on your contributions until you       take a distribution, typically
at retirement. The result? It actually costs       you less to save. To
illustrate, assume you contribute $100 each month to       your retirement
account:   <BR>

Over time, the additional earnings power of tax-deferred       compounding can
significantly increase the value of your retirement account.Of       course,
once you begin taking distributions from your 403(b) account, your      
withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.     </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="diverse">The Importance of
Diversification</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR> Investment choices you make today will affect the type of retirement
you'll enjoy in the future. No single investment is right for everyone. Before
you select your 403(b) investments, you'll want to carefully consider how much
you want your investments to earn and how much risk you're willing to accept in
order to achieve those earnings. By spreading your 403(b) assets over a variety
of investments that have different return potentials and risk levels, you may be
able to reduce the impact a decline in any one investment may have on your
entire portfolio. As a result, diversification may also help increase your
portfolio's overall return potential over time.<BR>
<BR> Our sample <A HREF="/strong/Retirement/5pies.htm">five model portfolios</A>
are intended to illustrate how asset allocation can work for you. When comparing
asset allocation models to your personal financial situation, you should
consider all of your assets, income and investments, in addition to your
retirement assets.<BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="answers">Answers to
Commonly-Asked Questions</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Who is eligible to participate in a 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Generally, employees of public schools or tax-exempt organizations
described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are eligible to
participate in 403(b) plans. Employers that are qualified to sponsor 403(b)
plans include hospitals, health care organizations, churches and other religious
organizations, colleges, universities, public and private schools, and certain
other non-profit organizations. You should consult with your employer to
determine whether or not it is qualified to sponsor a 403(b) plan, and whether
you're eligible to participate.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What types of funding arrangements are available for 403(b) plans?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Two types of funding arrangements are most commonly used for 403(b)
plans: <B>(1)</B> 403(b)(1) annuity contracts issued by insurance companies;
and <B>(2)</B> 403(b)(7) custodial accounts invested exclusively in mutual
funds. Employers may make one or both types of 403(b) funding arrangements
available to their eligible employees. Many individuals select mutual funds for
their 403(b) accounts, however, because of the professional management,
diversification, liquidity, flexibility and convenience they offer investors.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What types of contributions may be made to a 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> You may make pre-tax &quot;elective deferral&quot; contributions to
your 403(b) plan in accordance with your salary reduction agreement. In
addition, your organization may make &quot;non-elective&quot; contributions to
your 403(b) plan. All contributions to your 403(b) plan &amp;endash; whether
salary reduction contributions or non-elective employer contributions &amp;endash;
will be excluded from your current year gross income for federal income tax
purposes, only if they do not exceed certain limitations established by the IRS.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: How much can I contribute to my 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Generally, the maximum amount that may be contributed to your 403(b)
account each year, and excluded from your current year's gross income for
federal income tax purposes, depends upon a number of factors, including prior
retirement plan contributions, compensation, and years of service. Generally,
for any tax year, contributions to your 403(b) account are excludable from your
federal gross income to the extent they do not exceed the smallest of the
following three limits, whichever applies: <B>(1)</B> the annual dollar limit
on elective deferrals ($9,500 for the 1996 tax year); <B>(2)</B> your &quot;exclusion
allowance&quot; for the year'; and <B>(3)</B> the overall limit on
contributions (generally, the lesser of $30,000 or 25% of your compensation for
the year). However, there are special &quot;catch-up&quot; elections that may
increase the $9,500 elective deferral limit in certain years. Please contact
either your tax advisor, or obtain IRS Publication 571, to determine your
maximum allowable contribution.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What happens if I contribute more than the allowable limit?</B><BR> A:
So-called &quot;excess elective deferrals&quot; (generally, salary reduction
contributions over $9,500 per year or, any higher limit under a special &quot;catch-up&quot;
election) are included in your federal gross income for the tax year in which
they were made. If the plan allows, you can withdraw the excess elective
deferrals (plus earnings) by April 15 of the following year. If you do, the
excess elective deferrals will not have to be included in your federal gross
income for the year of the distribution, but the distributed earnings must be
included. So-called &quot;excess contributions&quot; (i.e., salary reduction and
non-elective employer contributions that exceed applicable annual limitations)
are included in your federal gross income for the tax year in which they were
made, and the excess reduces your exclusion allowance for future years, even
though the excess has already been included in your income.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: How often can I change my contribution amount?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> According to IRS regulations which recently changed on January 1, 1996,
there is no limit to the number of times you may make or change your salary
reduction agreement.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Can I transfer my existing assets from another 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes. Generally speaking, you may transfer your existing 403(b) plan
assets to another 403(b) Retirement Plan without penalty, assuming your existing
plan and IRS rules permit transfers. You'll want to check with your organization
and tax advisor for additional details.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Can I also contribute to an IRA?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Absolutely, although you'll want to maximize your contributions to
your 403(b) plan first. You can only contribute up to a maximum of $2,000 (or
100% of compensation if less than $2,000) each year to an Individual Retirement
Account. However, your ability to deduct IRA contributions may be affected by
your (or your spouse's) participation in any other retirement plan. If you and
your spouse file a joint income tax return; have an adjusted gross income of
more than $40,000; and at least one of you is covered by a retirement plan, you
lose some or all of your IRA income tax deduction.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What if I change employers?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Because all pre-tax salary reduction contributions you make to your
403(b) account are 100% vested immediately, you may be able to continue making
such contributions to your 403(b) account by signing a new salary reduction
agreement with your new employer. If your new employer is not eligible to offer
a 403(b) plan, you can let your existing 403(b) account grow tax-deferred even
though you may not currently make contributions.<BR>

<HR>
<P>Whether you're looking forward to a semi-retirement at 45, early retirement
at 55, or full retirement at 65 or later, choosing the right mix of investments
can be crucial.
</P>
<P>Being too cautious can be a mistake when you're investing for your future.
Many people believe that the best thing they can do with their nest egg is to
put it in a portfolio of low-risk investments, such as certificates of deposit
or money market funds. While such investments can offer regular payments and
help preserve your principal, they generally don't protect your savings against
the relentless effect of inflation or provide the growth you need to achieve
your retirement savings goals.*
</P>
<P>That's why you should consider stocks as part of your overall portfolio.
Historically, stocks have increased in value much faster than fixed-rate
investments and have significantly outpaced inflation over the long term. While
stocks can be more volatile in the short-term, their volatility has tended to
even out over time. So the longer you have to invest, the greater your use of
stocks generally can be.
</P>
<P>Even if you're retired, or close to retiring, consider keeping a portion of
your assets in stocks. That way, you give your investments the opportunity to
retain more purchasing power throughout your retirement. Please keep in mind
that these sample allocations aren't meant to be definitive. Rather, they're
intended to give you a point of reference when considering your own unique
situation.

<P>While it may be tempting to use the retirement money you've accumulated in
your <A HREF="/strong/Retirement/iras.htm">IRA</A> for major purchases like a
home or car, the penalties for withdrawing IRA money before age 59 1/2; could
substantially reduce the amount of your distribution. There is a 10% premature
withdrawal penalty on the amount you take out, in addition to a possible state
penalty. State and federal income tax would also be assessed against your
withdrawal*, since the distribution is considered ordinary income by the IRS in
the year you withdraw it.<BR>
<BR> The bottom line? You could lose a big portion of your money to taxes and
penalties if you withdraw IRA money before age 59 1/2;. What are your
alternatives? If you don't have money set aside in a non-retirement account,
consider an <A HREF="/strong/LearningCenter/aipbroch.htm">automatic investment
plan</A> to help you save on a monthly basis for your next major purchase.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> *Any deductible contributions and earnings are taxed as ordinary income.
Non-deductible contributions made to your IRA would not be taxed as ordinary
income.

 One of the most widely-used retirement savings vehicles, the Individual
Retirement Account (<A HREF="/strong/Retirement/iras.htm">IRA</A>), can be
opened by anyone under 70 1/2; with earned income. Usually, the limit is $2,000
per year per account or 100% of earned income, whichever is less. If you're
<A HREF="/strong/Retirement/sep-iras.htm">self-employed</A> or own a small
business, you may be able to contribute more. While your contribution may or may
not be tax-deductible, any gains in your IRA will grow tax-deferred. IRAs are an
easy way to help you build assets for retirement. Visit

<BR> Named after the section of the federal Internal Revenue Code that
authorizes this type of program, a 403(b) plan is a special tax-advantaged
retirement plan for employees of certain tax-exempt organizations and
educational institutions. Generally, a 403(b) plan can be either a 403(b)(1)
tax-sheltered annuity contract (TSA) issued by an insurer or a 403(b)(7)
custodial account invested exclusively in mutual fund shares. Either type of
403(b) plan allows you to make pre-tax contributions, taken from your paycheck,
to a special retirement annuity or custodial account set up specifically in your
name.<BR>
<BR> 403(b) plans are designed exclusively for employees of certain non-profit
organizations such as:<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Hospitals and health care organizations<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Charitable and other foundations<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Educational institutions, including
colleges, universities, public and private schools, and technical and vocational
institutions.<BR>
<BR> A 403(b) plan is funded through a voluntary salary reduction agreement
between you and your organization. You decide how much you want to contribute to
your account and how often, subject to certain IRS limits. Then, the amount you
want to save is automatically deducted from your paycheck on a before-tax basis
and allocated to the investments you select. It's that simple.<BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="power">Retirement Planning
Power</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR> A 403(b) plan gives you the unique opportunity to accumulate substantially
greater savings than through comparable taxable investment. Here's why:<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"> <B><FONT COLOR="#000080"> You pay
yourself first.</FONT></B> Your 403(b)       contributions are automatically
withdrawn from your paycheck on a regular       basis -- you don't need to write
a check. And there's no burdensome paperwork       to worry about. You can relax
knowing that each pay period, investing for       your retirement is given the
priority it deserves.<BR>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"> You pay less in
current taxes.</FONT></B> When you       contribute to a 403(b) plan, you
actually lower your taxable income. That's       because your contributions are
deducted from your salary before taxes are       taken out. This will enable you
to pay taxes on a smaller portion of your       salary. And you pay no federal
income tax on your contributions until you       take a distribution, typically
at retirement. The result? It actually costs       you less to save. To
illustrate, assume you contribute $100 each month to       your retirement
account:   <BR>

Over time, the additional earnings power of tax-deferred       compounding can
significantly increase the value of your retirement account.Of       course,

Diversification</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR> Investment choices you make today will affect the type of retirement
you'll enjoy in the future. No single investment is right for everyone. Before
you select your 403(b) investments, you'll want to carefully consider how much
you want your investments to earn and how much risk you're willing to accept in
order to achieve those earnings. By spreading your 403(b) assets over a variety
of investments that have different return potentials and risk levels, you may be
able to reduce the impact a decline in any one investment may have on your
entire portfolio. As a result, diversification may also help increase your
portfolio's overall return potential over time.<BR>
<BR> Our sample <A HREF="/strong/Retirement/5pies.htm">five model portfolios</A>
are intended to illustrate how asset allocation can work for you. When comparing
asset allocation models to your personal financial situation, you should
consider all of your assets, income and investments, in addition to your
retirement assets.<BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="answers">Answers to
Commonly-Asked Questions</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Who is eligible to participate in a 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Generally, employees of public schools or tax-exempt organizations
described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are eligible to
participate in 403(b) plans. Employers that are qualified to sponsor 403(b)
plans include hospitals, health care organizations, churches and other religious
organizations, colleges, universities, public and private schools, and certain
other non-profit organizations. You should consult with your employer to
determine whether or not it is qualified to sponsor a 403(b) plan, and whether
you're eligible to participate.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What types of funding arrangements are available for 403(b) plans?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Two types of funding arrangements are most commonly used for 403(b)
plans: <B>(1)</B> 403(b)(1) annuity contracts issued by insurance companies;
and <B>(2)</B> 403(b)(7) custodial accounts invested exclusively in mutual
funds. Employers may make one or both types of 403(b) funding arrangements
available to their eligible employees. Many individuals select mutual funds for
their 403(b) accounts, however, because of the professional management,
diversification, liquidity, flexibility and convenience they offer investors.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What types of contributions may be made to a 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> You may make pre-tax &quot;elective deferral&quot; contributions to
your 403(b) plan in accordance with your salary reduction agreement. In
addition, your organization may make &quot;non-elective&quot; contributions to
your 403(b) plan. All contributions to your 403(b) plan &amp;endash; whether
salary reduction contributions or non-elective employer contributions &amp;endash;
will be excluded from your current year gross income for federal income tax
purposes, only if they do not exceed certain limitations established by the IRS.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: How much can I contribute to my 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Generally, the maximum amount that may be contributed to your 403(b)
account each year, and excluded from your current year's gross income for
federal income tax purposes, depends upon a number of factors, including prior
retirement plan contributions, compensation, and years of service. Generally,
for any tax year, contributions to your 403(b) account are excludable from your
federal gross income to the extent they do not exceed the smallest of the
following three limits, whichever applies: <B>(1)</B> the annual dollar limit
on elective deferrals ($9,500 for the 1996 tax year); <B>(2)</B> your &quot;exclusion
allowance&quot; for the year'; and <B>(3)</B> the overall limit on
contributions (generally, the lesser of $30,000 or 25% of your compensation for
the year). However, there are special &quot;catch-up&quot; elections that may
increase the $9,500 elective deferral limit in certain years. Please contact
either your tax advisor, or obtain IRS Publication 571, to determine your
maximum allowable contribution.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What happens if I contribute more than the allowable limit?</B><BR> A:
So-called &quot;excess elective deferrals&quot; (generally, salary reduction
contributions over $9,500 per year or, any higher limit under a special &quot;catch-up&quot;
election) are included in your federal gross income for the tax year in which
they were made. If the plan allows, you can withdraw the excess elective
deferrals (plus earnings) by April 15 of the following year. If you do, the
excess elective deferrals will not have to be included in your federal gross
income for the year of the distribution, but the distributed earnings must be
included. So-called &quot;excess contributions&quot; (i.e., salary reduction and
non-elective employer contributions that exceed applicable annual limitations)
are included in your federal gross income for the tax year in which they were
made, and the excess reduces your exclusion allowance for future years, even
though the excess has already been included in your income.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: How often can I change my contribution amount?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> According to IRS regulations which recently changed on January 1, 1996,
there is no limit to the number of times you may make or change your salary
reduction agreement.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Can I transfer my existing assets from another 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes. Generally speaking, you may transfer your existing 403(b) plan
assets to another 403(b) Retirement Plan without penalty, assuming your existing
plan and IRS rules permit transfers. You'll want to check with your organization
and tax advisor for additional details.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Can I also contribute to an IRA?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Absolutely, although you'll want to maximize your contributions to
your 403(b) plan first. You can only contribute up to a maximum of $2,000 (or
100% of compensation if less than $2,000) each year to an Individual Retirement
Account. However, your ability to deduct IRA contributions may be affected by
your (or your spouse's) participation in any other retirement plan. If you and
your spouse file a joint income tax return; have an adjusted gross income of
more than $40,000; and at least one of you is covered by a retirement plan, you
lose some or all of your IRA income tax deduction.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What if I change employers?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Because all pre-tax salary reduction contributions you make to your
403(b) account are 100% vested immediately, you may be able to continue making
such contributions to your 403(b) account by signing a new salary reduction
agreement with your new employer. If your new employer is not eligible to offer
a 403(b) plan, you can let your existing 403(b) account grow tax-deferred even
though you may not currently make contributions.<BR>

<p><b><font COLOR="#000080"><i><font SIZE=+1>Its a Common Dream</font></i>



<br></font></b>Looking forward to a stage of life when work is optional

and leisure time is affordable. We call this dream, Retirement. However,

some glaring realities exist that, if ignored, can prevent you from achieving

your retirement dreams. Retirement Realities People are living longer.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, life expectancy

for men reaching retirement age (65) is currently 80 years and for women,

85 years. Depending on when you stop working, your savings may need to

last as long as 20 to 30 years into retirement. </p>



<p>People are living better. For many people the retirement years are filled

with recreation and activity, not rocking chairs. Experts suggest you may

need 70 - 80% of your pre-retirement income to maintain your current standard

of living into retirement. </p>



<p>Staying healthy is expensive. If medical costs continue to grow faster

than the cost of living, you may need to allocate a significant part of

your retirement budget to health and long-term care costs. And Medicare

isnt always the answer since, in many cases, Medicare may pay less than

half of your health care bills. </p>



<p>Housing wont be free. Many people expect that once they pay off their

mortgage, housing costs will evaporate. The truth is that after retirement,

property taxes will probably continue to rise and an older home will generally

need more maintenance.</p>



<p>Social Security wont be enough. Retirement experts point out that,

for many people, Social Security may provide less than half of their retirement

income. According to the Social Security Administration, for 1995 the average

annual benefit payout is only $10,296. Although the highest payout is currently

$14,388 a year, few people qualify for maximum benefits. </p>



<p><font SIZE=+1><b><i><font COLOR="#000080">The Bottom Line?</font></i></b>



<br></font>While the majority of Americans dream of the day when they will

no longer need to work 9 to 5, the fact is they may need more money than

they previously envisioned to make this happen. </p>

found that 55% of Americans hope to retire before age 65. <b>Reality: </b>Less

and less than one-third of Americans age 75 and older do. </p>

<p>&quot;Don't put all your eggs in one basket.&quot; It's good advice.

When it comes to investing, diversification - allocating your assets among

a variety of investments that have different return potentials and risk

levels - means not putting all your eggs into one investment basket. Since

market cycles vary, diversification may allow you to offset possible losses

in one investment type with potential gains in another and, as a result,

may help you reduce your overall exposure to risk. To illustrate how asset

allocation can work for you, we've created a Retirement Roundtable discussion

with four investors, each with a diversified portfolio that focuses on

their specific financial goals and particular risk tolerances. Keep in

mind, these are for illustrative purposes only. </p>

</p>



<p><a name="Start"></a><b><i><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>Start

smart.</font></font></i></b> &quot;It's hard to think about retirement

when you've just started to work. But I figure if I start saving now, I

won't have to put in as much every month, and I can still reach my goal

of retiring in a suit - a bathing suit, that is.&quot; Jackie Nelson is

27 and unmarried. She's been working for only a few years and retirement

seems a very long way off. Still she knows that the sooner she starts,

the less she will need to save in the long run. Because she is looking

at a long investment time horizon, Jackie feels comfortable with an aggressive

investment strategy. She decides to place 70% in aggressive investments

seeking long-term capital appreciation and 20% into investments offering

moderate growth. The final 10% is placed in more conservative fixed-income

investments to provide relative stability. </p>



<center><p><img src="/strong/images/Retirement/Start.jpg" alt="Start Pie Chart" border=0 height=148 width=167></p></center>



<p><b><i><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>Accent on growth.<a name="Accent on"></a></font></font></i></b>

&quot;With a baby on the way, we've had to change our thinking about saving

for the future. Now we're a little more concerned about security. Our current

diversification seems to strike the right balance for us.&quot; Alan Davis

is 35 and about to become a father. He and his wife, Connie, are managing

comfortably on their two salaries. Since they both participate in retirement

savings programs at work, they coordinate their plans to be sure their

combined strategy is right for their goals. Alan and Connie agree its important

to continue to invest aggressively, but they want to add some more stability

to their portfolio. They decide to place 60% in aggressive investments

that offer long-term growth potential, 20% in moderate growth investments

and 20% in conservative fixed-income investments to act as a hedge against

stock market fluctuations. </p>



<center><p><img src="/strong/images/Retirement/Growth.jpg" alt="Acccent on Growth Pie Chart" border=0 height=147 width=159></p></center>



<p><b><i><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>Achieve a balance.<a name="Achieve a"></a></font></font></i></b>

&quot;It hasn't been easy raising two boys by myself. Sometimes my budget

has been stretched with college tuition and all, but I know I need to keep

investing for my retirement as well.&quot; Divorced for seven years, 49-year-old

Suzanne Adams has two boys to support. Her oldest boy is in college and

her youngest will be entering in four more years. Even though college expenses

are a prime budget item, Suzanne has not lost sight of the importance of

her long-term retirement goals. Suzanne figures her risk tolerance is only

moderate, so she has chosen investments that seek to provide current income

and relative stability for 40% of her retirement money. She invests to

beat inflation by splitting the rest of her money between aggressive (30%)

and moderate growth (30%) investments. This balances her need for security

with the potential for capital appreciation. </p>



<center><p><img src="/strong/images/Retirement/Build.jpg" alt="Pie Chart of Building" border=0 height=149 width=172></p></center>



<p><a name="Build income, beat"></a><font COLOR="#000080"><b><i><font SIZE=+1>Build

income, beat inflation.</font></i></b> </font>&quot;I've worked hard for

the savings I've got. I don't want to risk losing any. But I could live

for another 25 years or more so I have to keep an eye on inflation and

taxes. I'm comfortable with my mix of equities and fixed-income investments.&quot;

At 59, Ed Cherney has set some specific retirement goals. He and his wife,

Patsy, always wanted to travel so they're already planning some extended

trips. Because Ed may choose to only work a few more years, his risk tolerance

is low. He needs steady income and wants to know that his principal is

protected. For current income and relative stability, Ed places 60% of

his funds in conservative fixed-income investments. But Ed also worries

about inflation, so he has 40% of his portfolio evenly split between aggressive

and moderate growth investments that will help him keep ahead of inflation.

of our Roundtable investors. The way you allocate your retirement assets,

and the type of <a href="/strong/html/Retirement/5pies.ht1">portfolio</a>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/strong/images/Retirement/savehurts.jpg" ALT="Save Til It Hurts"></CENTER>

<p>

<hr width="100%" >Most Americans don't have nearly enough retirement savings

set aside. About one-third of U.S. households have saved little or nothing

towards retirement, according to a report by the Employee Benefit Research

Institute (EBRI, March 1995). Of those who have saved for retirement, many

underestimate how much they'll need for what could be more than 20 years

of living once they retire. </p>



<p><b><i><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>How Much Will You Need? 

<br></font></font></i></b>Financial experts have developed a general rule

of thumb to help you make that calculation. By multiplying the amount of

income you want at retirement first by 20, and then by 25, you can estimate

a range of how much you'll need to retire comfortably. <BR><P><I>For example:</I> if

you want a pre-tax retirement income of $30,000 a year, you will probably

need to amass between $600,000 and $750,000. (These numbers will change

based upon years to retirement and rate of return.) That can seem like

an overwhelming number. But you can get there from here - if you begin

now and save, save, save instead of spend, spend, spend. </p>



<p><b><i><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>Saving More To Reach Your

Goal.</font></font></i></b> 

<br>If you invest $500 a month in an account growing at 8% annually, in

25 years you'll accumulate $475,500.* This is a healthy sum of money but

it's still short of the $600,000 goal from our previous example. If you

increase your savings to $750 a month, your account could grow to more

than $713,000. 
<BR><P><FONT SIZE=-1>*Assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. </FONT></p>



<p><b>Living well later may mean reduced spending now. The more creative

you can be about your spending now, the less spartan you may have to be

later.</b> </p>



<p><b><i><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>One Couple Had a Trial Run

for a Year.</font></font></i></b> 

<br>Living on the amount of income they estimated they'd have at retirement,

they quickly realized they needed to scale back their spending and to save

a much larger percentage of their earnings. 

<br><b><i><font SIZE=+1><font COLOR="#000080">Postpone Major Expenses</font><font COLOR="#800080">.</font></font></i></b>



<br>If you can postpone major expenses for another year or two, you can

set more aside today. You may be able to wait one more year before you

buy a new car or take that two-week vacation to Hawaii. 

<br><b><i><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>Modify Your Everyday Habits.</font></font></i></b>



<br>Saving a dollar here and there might not seem very important on a day-to-day

basis, but over time those dollars can really add up. If you saved just

$5 each workday - by taking your lunch to work, for example - after 25

years you could accumulate close to $100,000, assuming you earned 8% and

reinvested your dividends and capital gains. 

<br><b><i><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>Rethink Your Housing Situation.</font></font></i></b>



<br>Before you buy a new house and increase your mortgage, consider whether

you can make your current home more livable, at least for the time being. One option might be to 

save one spouse's earnings. If you belong to one of America's 31 million

two-career couples, consider living on one salary and banking the other.

It can be an adjustment, but one that can pay big dividends later. </p>



<p><b>Remember, attitude is critical to retirement saving success. The

sacrifice you make today could make your retirement years more comfortable.

</b></p>

<title>Investment Choices for the 21st Century</title>

<br>Participating in your company's 401(k) retirement
savings program is an important first step toward achieving
your retirement dreams.  <B>Choosing the right investments is 
the next.</B> That's because your investment choices today will
impact the type of retirement you will enjoy in the next 
century. <p>
The most common investment options fall into two 
main categories:<p>

<BR><P>
<B>You May Choose From Ownership Investments...</B><p>
 
Stocks, or equity investments, represent ownership in 
a company. Stocks offer you the opportunity for both 
dividends (your share of the company's profits) and 
capital appreciation (the growth in value of your shares), 
but their value will fluctuate over time.<p>
When investing for long-term growth, common stocks have
historically been investment champions. If you had placed 
$1 into a broad-based group of stocks represented by the 
Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index at the end of 1925 and 
reinvested all of your dividends, despite market ups and 
downs, your $1 investment would have grown to $803.11 
by the end of 1994, a span of 69 years. <p>
If you had invested your $1 in more stable Treasury bills 
instead, your investment would have grown to only $10.23.<p>

<I><FONT SIZE=-1>The Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index is 
an unmanaged index generally representative of the U.S. Stock 
Market.  Treasury bills are represented by returns of 91-day 
U.S. Treasury bills which are insured by the U.S. government 
as to principal and interest.  Past performance does not represent
future results.<p></I></FONT>

<BR><P>
<B>...Or From Loaner-Ship Investments</B>.<p> 

Fixed-income investments are simply debt obligations 
(loans) of a company or government. They pay a fixed-income 
rate over a set period of time. Because their value tends 
to fluctuate less than stocks, they generally appeal to 
more conservative investors. <p> 
Bonds, which represent loans to corporations as well as 
the U.S. government and municipalities, will fluctuate in
value as interest rates change. Money market securities 
(certificates of deposit, Treasury bills, commercial 
paper, etc.) which represent very short-term loans to 
banks, corporations and governments are more predictable 
investments than stocks or bonds. Still, the exact amount 
of interest they generate will fluctuate over time. 
Guaranteed investment contracts, which are sponsored by 
insurance companies, guarantee the payment of interest 
and return of principal, much like a certificate of deposit.
However, unlike CDs they are not federally insured.<p> 
No single investment is right for everyone. That's why your 
company's 401(k) retirement savings program offers you a 
variety of carefully selected investment options. You can 
pick the investment or combination of investments that 
best fits your particular needs, goals and objectives.

<H3><A NAME="_wmh3_829605233">Advantages of a SEP-IRA </A></H3>
<P>A SEP-IRA enables you to establish a company-funded retirement program for
yourself without the administrative expense, government reporting requirements,
and complexity associated with many other types of retirement plans. It
offers other advantages too: </P>
<P><B>Flexibility. </B>Other than the 15% contribution limit for 1996 (of the first $150,000 of
your compensation), there are no annual contribution requirements. You can
contribute 5% one year, 10% the next, and even skip a year if you want.
Also, because you have until the due date (including extensions) for filing
your federal income tax return to establish or contribute to a SEP-IRA,
you have time to get a clear picture of your business's financial status
first. </P>
<P>If you are self-employed and are age 70 1/2 or older, you can still contribute
to a SEP-IRA even though you can no longer contribute to a regular IRA. </P>
<P><B>Simplicity. </B>Unlike qualified plans, no extra IRA or government reporting is required.
Just fill out the simple Form 5305-SEP and file it with your personal records.
(Form 5305-SEP is included in Strong's SEP-IRA investment kit, which may
be <A HREF="/strong/html/regular.ht1">ordered through regular mail</A> or by calling 1-800-359-3379).  You may then take a deduction on your federal
income tax return for your SEP-IRA contribution. </P>
<P><B>Low cost.</B> With a Strong SEP-IRA, there is no set-up fee to establish your plan. </P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="_wmh3_829605405">Who Should Consider a SEP-IRA? </A></H3>
<P>If you are self-employed and earn income, you can establish a SEP-IRA. If
you want to contribute up to 15% of your pre-tax income to a retirement
plan, a SEP-IRA may be especially useful. Consider a SEP-IRA if you: </P>
<P><IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif">own your own business -- your business can be incorporated or unincorporated,
or a Subchapter S corporation. <BR>
 <IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif">farm, consult or free-lance. <BR>
 <IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif">have income from work you do &quot;on the side&quot; such as acting or selling your

<P>You can contribute income from part-time services even if you're already

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="_wmh3_829605376">Determining Your Contribution </A></H3>
<P>For self-employed individuals, calculating the SEP-IRA contribution is a
fairly simple process. Use the worksheet below to <B>calculate your maximum
deductible contribution</B>. Fill in your contribution rate, your net earnings,
and your self employment tax, click on the <B>'Calculate Now'</B> button, and we'll do the

Reality Check</FONT><BR>By Paul T. Beste<BR>Certified Public Accountant and
director of taxation at Strong Funds</FONT></B></P>
<HR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">While the <A HREF="/strong/Retirement/iras.ht1">Individual
Retirement Account (IRA)</A> is still one of the most popular savings vehicles
available, it's also one of the most underutilized. Many investors mistakenly
believe that &#150; for any number of reasons &#150; IRAs don't make sense for
them. <B>The following four points help debunk the most common misconceptions
about IRAs.</B><BR><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Myth:</FONT></B>
<B>Contributing to an IRA makes sense only for those people who qualify for the
income tax deduction.<BR></B><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Reality:</FONT></B> Even if
you don't qualify for the tax deduction, making an annual IRA contribution may
make more sense than ever &#150; especially if your taxes go up from year to
year. Why? An IRA allow your original investment to grow tax-deferred. That
means your IRA earnings &#150; be they interest, dividends, capital gains,
royalties, or another source &#150; don't count toward your current taxable
income. Instead, your tax liability is deferred until you actually receive the
money, which, depending on your age and when you retire, could be decades into
the future. In the meantime, the tax advantage &#150; compounded over time &#150;
can make a huge difference in the size of your retirement nest egg.<BR><BR><B><FONT
COLOR="#000080">Myth:</FONT></B> <B>The best way to make my annual IRA
contribution is in a $2,000 lump sum as close to April 15th as possible.</B><BR><B><FONT
COLOR="#000080">Reality:</FONT></B> You're probably better off investing
smaller amounts throughout the year. Many people mistakenly view investing as an
event rather than a process. And the problem with events is that they're too
easy to put off &#150; or to avoid altogether. You can easily overcome that
problem by establishing a systematic investment program for your IRA. Most
mutual funds have very low minimum investment requirements to set up an
automatic investment plan that allows you to deposit a set amount each month
directly from your checking account. Suppose, for example, you invested $166.66
a month ($2000/12). For most investors, that approach is easier to handle than
scrambling to find a spare $2,000 all at once. Plus, by starting your
contributions in January instead of waiting until April of the following year,
you put your retirement assets &#150; and the power of tax-deferred compounding &#150;
to work for you earlier.<BR><BR><FONT COLOR="#000080"><B>Myth:</B></FONT>
<B>I'm too young to have an IRA.</B><BR><FONT COLOR="#000080"><B>Reality:</B></FONT>
It's never too soon to think about retirement planning. In fact, the earlier you
start, the easier it will be. Take Alice, who starts a $72-a-month IRA plan when
she enters the workforce at age 23. Assuming she earns an 8% annual return, she
would accumulate approximately $250,000 by the time she's 63. Then there's Bob,
who waits until he's 33. To match Alice's total, he'd have to put away over
twice as much per month &#150; $166 &#150; for 30 years. Charlie, who doesn't
start until he's 43, can never catch up solely with his IRA. Even after 20 years
of contributing the maximum of $166 per month ($2000 per year), Charlie would
have a shortfall of over $150,000. He'd have to come up with an additional $258
per month &#150; over and above his IRA contribution &#150; to build the same
account balance. And that's assuming he can find an investment that nets 8%
after taxes.</P>

<TITLE>The Benefits of Tax Deferral</TITLE>

<B>Keep your retirement-plan assets working for you</B><P>
</CENTER>

<BR>
Financial experts agree that to ensure a comfortable retirement, it's important to keep building <I>all</I> your sources of retirement income. A lump-sum distribution -- however small -- from your previous employer's qualified retirement plan might make a substantial difference in the total amount of money you may have in the future.<BR>
<BR>
By allowing the retirement benefits you've accumulated so far to continue growing tax-deferred over time, you can take advantage of the very real power of compounding. Here's an example.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Michael's Dilemma<BR>
</STRONG><BR>
Michael, age 35, is changing jobs. He receives a $5,000 distribution from his employer's retirement plan. With a bright future ahead, he decides to &quot;splurge&quot; and use the money as a down payment on a new car. After all, he says, &quot;$5,000 isn't a lot of money, and I have lots of time to make it up before I retire.&quot;
<P>

<CENTER><B>$5,000 Could Have Grown into $55,000</B><BR>
<IMG SRC=/strong/images/Retirement/michael.jpg><BR>
<I>This hypothetical illustration assumes an 8% annual return,<BR> compounded monthly, with all dividends and capital gains reinvested
.<BR> It is not intended to represent the returns of any Strong Fund.</I><BR></CENTER>

<P>
For most people, a company retirement-plan distribution can represent a crucial factor in determining their financial well-being -- and may well mean the difference between a secure, comfortable retirement and years of financial worry.<BR>

<TITLE>Know the Rollover Rules</TITLE>

<B>The high cost of taxes and penalties</B></P>
</CENTER>
<P>
The easiest way to continue the tax-deferred status of your retirement assets is to arrange for your entire payout to be transferred directly into either your new employer's qualified plan or into a Rollover IRA. The key, however, is making the decision <I>before</I> you receive a check from your previous employer. <BR>
<BR>
That's because unless you arrange to have your distribution sent directly to another qualified plan or IRA, your previous employer is required by the Internal Revenue Service to withhold 20% -- one-fifth of your payout -- to cover taxes.<BR>
<BR>
If you do receive your payout, you can still roll all or part of the money you receive into an IRA or other qualified plan, but you must complete the transaction within 60 days. And if you want to avoid paying taxes on that 20% the IRS already took, you have to replace that money <I>out of your own pocket</I>. <BR>
<BR>
Unless you properly reinvest your distribution within the 60-day window, the entire amount will be subject to federal income tax and, depending on where you live, state and local taxes, as well. What's more, if you're under age 59&#189;, your distribution may also be subject to an early-withdrawal penalty of 10%.<BR>
<BR>

The bottom line? If you do not utilize a direct rollover, you could lose nearly half of your retirement-plan distribution to taxes and
 penalties alone. And, once you've taken your distribution and paid taxes on it, your money cannot be rolled into another qualified pl
 an. Its tax-deferred status is lost forever.<BR>
 <P>
 As the chart below illustrates, losing such a significant portion of your retirement savings to taxes and penalties can have far-reach
 ing implications for your financial future.<BR>
 <P>
 <CENTER><B>Taxes and withdrawal penalties can eat up nearly half your distribution</B><BR>
 <IMG SRC=/strong/images/Retirement/22.jpg>
 </CENTER>

<P>
If you want to roll the entire amount of your lump-sum distribution into another tax-deferred investment, you have two options, as described in the following example, which assumes a distribution of $50,000.<BR>

<TD><B>$50,000</B><BR>(deposited directly from your old plan into your new rollover IRA or qualified plan, with no taxes withheld or penalties owed)</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>

<P>
In short, by arranging a direct rollover, you can protect your retirement savings from unnecessary taxes and penalties while still maintaining the ability to withdraw the funds later, if needed. Keep in mind that any withdrawals you take before you reach age 59&#189; will be subject to both current income tax and a 10% early-withdrawal penalty.
<P>
Strong Funds makes it easy to arrange for the direct transfer of your retirement-plan distribution. Just order or download one of Strong's <A HREF="/strong/orderform.ht1">IRA investment kits</A>.  The IRA Transfer Form located in the back of the IRA booklet can be used for a direct rollover of your retirement-plan distribution.  Your kit will also include a prospectus which contains more complete information including fees and expenses.  Please read the prospectus carefully, then complete the IRA application and the transfer forms and return them to us at the address indicated. We'll take care of the rest. In the meantime, if you have any questions about investing your lump-sum distribution, please 
call a Retirement-Plans Specialist at 1-800-588-4472.<BR>

<HR>
<P>Whether you're looking forward to a semi-retirement at 45, early retirement
at 55, or full retirement at 65 or later, choosing the right mix of investments
can be crucial.
</P>
<P>Being too cautious can be a mistake when you're investing for your future.
Many people believe that the best thing they can do with their nest egg is to
put it in a portfolio of low-risk investments, such as certificates of deposit
or money market funds. While such investments can offer regular payments and
help preserve your principal, they generally don't protect your savings against
the relentless effect of inflation or provide the growth you need to achieve
your retirement savings goals.*
</P>
<P>That's why you should consider stocks as part of your overall portfolio.
Historically, stocks have increased in value much faster than fixed-rate
investments and have significantly outpaced inflation over the long term. While
stocks can be more volatile in the short-term, their volatility has tended to
even out over time. So the longer you have to invest, the greater your use of
stocks generally can be.
</P>
<P>Even if you're retired, or close to retiring, consider keeping a portion of
your assets in stocks. That way, you give your investments the opportunity to
retain more purchasing power throughout your retirement. Please keep in mind
that these sample allocations aren't meant to be definitive. Rather, they're
intended to give you a point of reference when considering your own unique
situation.

A substantial financial commitment deserves an exceptional level of 
service.  For households with a balance of <B>$250,000 or more</B>, Strong 
offers the Preferred Client program. For no charge or obligation, Strong 
Preferred Clients enjoy several enhanced services, which you can explore by 
clicking on the icons above. If you'd like to learn more, please contact 
Strong at 1-800-368-3940. Or E-mail us using the &quot;Contact Us&quot; 
button at the bottom of this page.<P>

<I><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Service with a personal touch:</FONT></B></I> As a
Strong Preferred Client, you'll work with a small group of highly-trained,
highly-experienced Preferred Client Representatives. Your representatives are
dedicated to making your relationship with Strong a satisfying and rewarding
experience. These individuals have an indepth knowledge of Strong products, 
and meet frequently with portfolio managers and other decision-makers. So 
you can be sure the information you receive is current and complete.<P>

Over time, your Preferred Client representatives will grow to know you and
your investment needs, and will help ensure that Strong is doing everything
possible to help you pursue your financial goals.<P>

<I><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Simplified recordkeeping:</FONT></B></I> The
paperwork involved in investment transactions can be time-consuming and 
tedious, but your Preferred Client representative can make recordkeeping 
easy. Whether you're rolling over a retirement plan distribution, changing 
account registrations, or establishing a wire transfer to your bank, your 
representative would be happy to help. Of course, our degree of involvement 
is up to you: we can give you step-by-step assistance, or prepare entire 
documents for your signature. So if there's a recordkeeping task you hate, 
hand it over to us.<P>

<I><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Superior communications:</FONT></B></I> As a Strong
Preferred Client, you'll be among the first to know about any new Strong
products or services, either through written communications, or a phone call
from your Preferred Client representatives.<P>

<I><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Special considerations:</FONT></B></I> Strong
Preferred Clients are not subject to certain administrative fees charged by 
the
advisor. And we can help expedite communications between various financial
institutions. Preferred Client representatives will work on your behalf to 
help your important transactions go more smoothly.<P>

The <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Strong High-Yield Bond Fund</FONT></B> seeks
total return by investing for a high level of current income and capital
growth. The Fund is designed for investors who want to pursue higher income
than higher-quality bonds generally provide and who are willing to accept
increased share-price fluctuation in pursuit of that goal. To help manage
the credit risk associated with lower-quality bonds, the Fund's manager is
highly selective, utilizing stringent credit analysis to identify bonds for
the portfolio.<BR>

<P>
Hello. This is Jeff Koch, portfolio manager of the Strong Advantage Fund.
Thank you for visiting Strong's Web Site, and for your interest in Strong
Funds. The Strong Advantage Fund's goal is to provide investors with a higher
level income than a money market fund. You should note that, unlike a money
market fund, the Advantage Fund's share price will vary, and the Fund may
invest in lower quality bonds. But its share price fluctuations are expected
to be very modest, due to the Fund's ultra-short average maturity, and the
stringent credit analysis that we apply to every bond we buy. You may want
to consider this Fund if you have substantial assets parked in lower-yielding
securities, have a year or more to invest, and you're willing to accept a
very low degree of share price fluctuation in exchange for a higher potential
yield. To learn more, visit our <A HREF="/strong/html/cashguid.htm">Guide
to Effective Cash Management</A>. You can also order or download a Strong
Cash Management Funds prospectus by clicking on the Request Info button below.
Again, thank you for your interest in Strong Funds.

The <B><FONT COLOR="000080">Strong Government Securities Fund </FONT></B>
seeks total return by investing for a high level of current income with a
moderate degree of share-price fluctuation. The Fund normally invests at
least 80% of its total assets in U.S. government securities. To enhance yield
and total-return potential, the Fund's manager carefully calibrates the
portfolio's maturity, extending maturity in favorable markets to pursue higher
returns and shortening its maturity when a more defensive positioning seems
warranted.<BR>

<I> <FONT size=2>Morningstar's proprietary ratings reflect historical
risk-adjusted performance and are subject to change every month. Overall
ratings are calculated from a fund's 3- and 5-year (not 1-year) average annual
total returns in excess of 90-day Treasury bill returns with appropriate
fee adjustments and a risk factor that reflects fund performance below 90-day
T-bill returns. 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars,
22.5% receive 4 stars, 35% receive 3 stars, 22.5% receive 2 stars, and 10%
receive 1 star. There were 1672, 1075, 589, and 239 funds in Morningstar's
Fixed-Income category for the one-, three, five, and ten-year periods ended
11-30-96, respectively. From time to time, the Fund's advisor has waived

"Hello. This is Rimas Milatis, portfolio manager of the Strong Equity Income
Fund. Thank you for visiting Strong Funds web site, and for your interest
in Strong Funds. The Strong Equity Income Fund is designed to provide investors
with a relatively conservative approach to stock investing. The Fund seeks
total return by investing for both income and capital growth. It concentrates
its investments in larger, dividend-paying companies that we believe can
grow their revenues and earnings on a consistent basis. You might want to
consider this Fund for goals that are more than 5 years away, such as building
assets for retirement or financing a child's college education. It might
also be used to help diversify and reduce the volatility of a more aggressive
stock portfolio. To learn more, order or download a Strong Conservative Equity
Funds prospectus by clicking on the icon below."

"Hello. This is Rimas Milatis, portfolio manager of the Strong Growth and
Income Fund. Thank you for visiting Strong Funds web site, and for your interest
in Strong Funds. As its name implies, the Strong Growth and Income Fund is
designed to provide investors with the potential for capital growth and income.
Unlike more aggressive growth funds, which generally invest for capital growth,
this Fund seeks high total return by investing for a combination of both
capital growth and income. The Fund therefore concentrates its investments
in larger, dividend-paying companies to provide an income component, and
to a lesser extent, the stocks of smaller companies to help increase growth
potential. You might want to consider this Fund for goals that are more than
5 years away, such as retirement or to help diversify a more aggressive stock
portfolio. To learn more, order or download a Strong Conservative Equity
Funds prospectus by clicking on the icon below."

"Hello. This is David Schafer, portfolio manager of the Strong Schafer Value 
Fund. Thanks for visiting the Strong Funds web site, and for your interest
in Strong Funds. We manage the Strong Schafer Value Fund to provide
investors with a somewhat conservative approach to stock investing. Unlike
growth funds, which tend to invest in companies of all sizes, this Fund
concentrates on medium-to large-sized companies. We are also "value"
investors, which means we try to pay as little as possible for growth
potential. And finally, we equally weight all the Fund's holdings to help
maintain a broadly diversified portfolio. You might want to consider this
Fund for goals that are more than 5 years away, such as building assets for
retirement or financing a child's college education. To learn more, download 
a Strong Schafer Value Fund prospectus by clicking on the icon below."

The <B><FONT COLOR="000080"> Strong Small Cap Fund</FONT></B> seeks capital
growth. The Fund invests primarily in the stocks of companies that have small
market capitalizations, which we generally define as $2 billion or less at
the time of the Fund's investment.
<P>
<I>Please note: While investments in smaller-capitalization companies may
offer greater return potential, they often involve greater risks than investments
in established companies.</I>

"Hello. This is Mary Lisanti, portfolio manager of the Strong Small Cap Fund.
Thank you for visiting the Strong Funds web site, and for your interest in
Strong Funds. The Strong Small Cap Fund invests primarily in the stocks of
small companies. Historically, these stocks have grown faster than the stocks
of larger, more established companies. Of course, they can also be more risky
and their share prices will be more volatile than the stocks of larger firms.
To help manage these risks, we use broad-based research to identify major
trends in the market. Then we closely analyze individual companies to determine
which ones appear best positioned to capitalize on these trends. You might
want to consider the Strong Small Cap Fund if you're investing for goals
that are more than five years away, such as building assets for retirement
or financing a child's college education. To learn more, download a Strong
Growth Funds prospectus by clicking on the Request Info button below. Again,
thank you for your interest in Strong Funds."

total returns in excess of 90-day Treasury bill returns with appropriate
fee adjustments and a risk factor that reflects fund performance below 90-day
T-bill returns. 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars,
22.5% receive 4 stars, 35% receive 3 stars, 22.5% receive 2 stars, and 10%
receive 1 star. There were 2907, 1769, 1042, AND 586&nbsp;funds in Morningstar's

Hello. This is Jeff Koch, portfolio co-manager of the Strong Corporate Bond
Fund. Thank you for visiting Strong's Web Site, and for your interest in
Strong Funds. The Strong Corporate Bond Fund seeks total return -- by investing
for a high level of current income with moderate share price fluctuation.
We pursue this goal by focusing primarily on BBB-rated corporate bonds, which
historically have offered attractive yields and the potential for rising
prices. These bonds are the lowest-rated tier of investment-grade bonds,
so credit research is important. That's why we apply rigorous credit analysis
to every bond we buy. We seek to identify bonds offering exceptional value,
or that are poised for a credit upgrade that could lead to higher prices.
If you're looking for a bond fund designed for total return and have an
investment horizon of four years or more, you may want to consider the Corporate
Bond Fund. To learn more, order or download a Strong Income Funds prospectus
by clicking on the Request Info button below. Again, thank you for your interest
in Strong Funds.

Hello. This is Jeff Koch, portfolio manager of the Strong High-Yield Bond
Fund. Thank you for visiting Strong's Web Site, and for your interest in
Strong Funds. The Strong High-Yield Bond Fund is Strong's most aggressive
income fund, offering the highest yield and total return potential of all
our domestic income products. We pursue this high yield goal by investing
primarily in corporate bonds that are rated below investment-grade. Obviously,
these bonds may entail significant risks. So we are highly selective, purchasing
only those bonds that pass our stringent credit tests. If your investment
goal is more than four years away and you can accept significant share price
fluctuation, you may want to consider this Fund to boost the potential return
of a diversified bond portfolio. To learn more, order or download a Strong
Income Funds prospectus by clicking on the Request Info button below. Again,
thank you for your interest in Strong Funds.

The <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Strong Short-Term Global Bond Fund</FONT></B>
seeks total return by investing for a high level of income with a low degree
of share-price fluctuation. In pursuit of this objective, the Fund invests
primarily in investment-grade bonds of U.S. and foreign issuers. Although
the Fund's holdings normally will be spread among a variety of countries
and currencies, at least 35% of its holdings will remain invested in the
U.S. market. To further limit the effect of foreign currency movements, the
Fund's managers will employ currency-hedging techniques.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1> <I>Please note that this Fund is "non-diversified," meaning,
it is able to concentrate its holdings more than a similar, diversified fund.
While this approach enhances return potential, it may also magnify
risk.</I></FONT>

"Hello. This is Anthony Cragg, portfolio manager of the Strong International
Stock Fund. Thank you for visiting the Strong Funds web site, and for your
interest in Strong Funds. The Strong International Stock Fund seeks capital
growth by investing primarily in non-U.S. stock markets. Rather than concentrate
on specific countries, we use a &amp;quot;bottom-up&amp;quot; investment
approach, which means we attempt to select individual companies that we believe
are attractively valued and offer the greatest opportunity for growth, even
if those firms happen to be in under-performing markets. Of course, international
investing entails special risks, and while the Fund seeks to reduce these
risks through diligent research and active portfolio management, the Fund's
share price is likely to vary more than that of a U.S.-only growth fund.
For goals that are more than 5 years away, you might want to consider the
Strong International Stock Fund to pursue long-term growth opportunities
around the globe. To learn more, order or download a Strong International
Funds prospectus by clicking on the Request Info button below. Again, thank
you for your interest in Strong Funds."

"Hello. This is Anthony Cragg, portfolio manager of the Strong Asia Pacific
Fund. Thank you for visiting the Strong Funds web site, and for your interest
in Strong Funds. As its name suggests, the Asia Pacific Fund concentrates
its investments in the Pacific Basin and Asia. We believe these countries
are particularly attractive because many of their economies are growing at
more than 7% per year, compared to a 2% growth rate for America, and even
less for mature European countries. The rapid development in Asian countries
means that companies based there are capable of spectacular growth. Of course,
there are special risks associated with international investing, which can
be intensified in the Asia Pacific Fund because its assets are concentrated
in one region of the world. If you want to diversify your portfolio to pursue
long-term growth opportunities in this fast-growing region, and your goal
is more than 5 years away, you might want to consider the Strong Asia Pacific
Fund. To learn more, order or download a Strong International Funds prospectus
by clicking on the Request Info button below. Again, thank you for your interest
in Strong Funds."

fee adjustments and a risk factor that reflects fund performance below 90-day
T-bill returns. 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars,

The <FONT COLOR="#000080"><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Strong American Utilities
Fund</FONT></B></FONT> seeks total return by investing for both income and
capital growth. The Fund invests primarily in the stocks of domestic utilities,
such as telephone, cable, electric, and natural-gas companies. The Fund may
also invest a portion of its assets in the stocks of energy companies.
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=-1>Please note that this Fund is considered "non-diversified,"
meaning it is able to concentrate its assets more than a similar, diversified
fund. While this approach enhances return potential, it may also magnify
risk. </FONT></I>

<I> <FONT size=2>Morningstar's proprietary ratings reflect historical
risk-adjusted performance and are subject to change every month. Overall
ratings are calculated from a fund's 3- and 5-year (not 1-year) average annual
total returns in excess of 90-day Treasury bill returns with appropriate
fee adjustments and a risk factor that reflects fund performance below 90-day
T-bill returns. 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars,
22.5% receive 4 stars, 35% receive 3 stars, 22.5% receive 2 stars, and 10%
receive 1 star. There were 1739, 1074, and 569 funds in Morningstar's Municipal
category for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended 11-30-96, respectively.
From time to time, the Fund's advisor has waived management fees and/or expenses,
resulting in higher returns. </FONT></I>

<B>This month's question: </B>U.S. stocks have been performing well during
the last couple of years. Why would I want to invest in foreign stocks?
<P>
<P>
<B>Respondent:</B> Anthony Cragg, portfolio manager of the
<A HREF="/strong/Our_Funds/International/intsprfl.ht1">Strong International
Stock Fund</A> and the
<A HREF="/strong/Our_Funds/International/asiaprfl.ht1">Strong Asia Pacific
Fund</A>.
<P>
"We believe there are several reasons why investing in foreign stocks is
a good idea for long-term, growth-oriented investors. Your question points
out one of them. &nbsp;The U.S. market has done quite well during the last
couple of years, but as a result, it may be fully valued. In addition, many
countries -- particularly those in the Pacific region -- have economies that
are growing three or four times as fast as that of the U.S., but whose markets
are undervalued compared to the U.S market. &nbsp;So we think U.S.-based
investors looking for growth may turn their sights abroad. Another reason
for investing internationally is more timeless -- diversification. &nbsp;Studies
have shown that a stock portfolio invested partially in international stocks
can help increase return potential and lessen volatility compared to a U.S.-only
portfolio. That&#146;s because global markets seldom move in tandem, so gains
in one market may help offset losses in another. It&#146;s important to note
that investing internationally entails special risks, including currency
fluctuations, government regulations, and the potential for political and
economic instability. So international investments are best suited for the
long term -- preferably for goals that are more than 5 years away. If
you&#146;re a growth-oriented investor, diversifying internationally may
help make the high return potential of international markets work for you."

a future investment-related topic for discussion, please send us an

<P><B>This month's question:</B> What are &quot;small cap&quot; stocks, and
what advantages do they offer over other kinds of stocks?
</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Respondent:</B> Mary Lisanti, portfolio manager of the
<A HREF="/strong/Our_Funds/Growth_Funds/smcpprfl.ht1">Strong Small Cap Fund</A>.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&quot;A 'small cap stock' is just another way of saying 'small company
stock.' The chief advantage of small company stocks is their growth potential.
Historically, they've delivered higher returns over time than either bonds or
the stocks of larger companies. They have the potential to deliver powerful
growth because they tend to operate very efficiently. These companies are often
new entrants into the marketplace, offer innovative products, and can get
products to the market quickly. The chief drawback of small company stocks is
their volatility -- this is the part of the market most ruled by emotion, and
it's not uncommon for these stocks to double in value, or lose most of their
value, in very short period of time. For that reason, it's vital that investors
interested in small cap stocks be aware of their volatile nature -- they are not
suitable for a short-term investments. However, if your goal is more than five
years away and you're seeking to diversify your portfolio to increase its return
potential, small cap stocks can be an attractive option.&quot;</P>

<P><B>This month's question:</B> I'm a relatively new investor with a goal
that's approximately 10 years away. Since I have a longer-term goal, all my
investments are in a stock fund. Why would I want to put money into a bond fund?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Respondent:</B> Jeffrey A. Koch, portfolio manager of the
<A HREF="/strong/Our_Funds/Cash_Management/advprfl.ht1">Strong Advantage Fund</A>
and the <A HREF="/strong/Our_Funds/Income/highprfl.ht1">Strong High-Yield Bond
Fund</A>, and portfolio co-manager of the
<A HREF="/strong/Our_Funds/Income/corpprfl.ht1">Strong Corporate Bond Fund</A>.
</P>
<P>If you seek maximum growth potential over a 10-year period and can accept
the stock market's volatility, it's a good idea to emphasize stocks. However, it
can be dangerous to put 'all your eggs in one basket' and invest in just one
asset class, because, if that asset class suffers a major downturn, everything
you've saved is vulnerable. That's why it's important to establish a <I>portfolio</I>
that includes several asset classes, rather than to rely on one type of
investment. By diversifying your assets to include bonds as well as stocks, you
may lessen your portfolio's downside risk and increase its return potential
should stocks experience a prolonged bear market. As a new investor, you may
have not witnessed such a market, but believe me, they happen. As you draw
closer to your goal, or if you have a shorter-term investment horizon, you can
increase the proportion of bonds and cash in your portfolio to potentially
protect your gains. For help in determining the mix of stocks, bonds and cash
that may suit your individual needs, visit our

<P><B>This month's question:</B> I hear a lot about &quot;growth stocks&quot;
and &quot;value stocks.&quot; What's the difference, and is one better than
another?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Respondent:</B> David Schafer, portfolio manager of the
<A HREF="/strong/Our_Funds/Schafer/schaprfl.ht1">Strong Schafer Value Fund</A>.<BR>
<BR> &quot;Growth&quot; stocks are generally considered by most investors to be
companies whose earnings-per-share growth rates exceed 10 - 15% a year on a
sustained basis, say for the next 5 to 10 years. Because a growth stock is
thought to be that of a leading company, they often trade at higher valuations
versus the market. Conversely, &quot;value&quot; stocks are those that are
trading at a discount to the market, based on a company's book value, earnings,
or other measures. Value stocks trade at a discount because they may be out of
favor given the current economic or political environment, in the process of
restructuring, or not widely followed by industry analysts. Often times, it's
these challenging situations that create attractive opportunities -- and make it
worthwhile to invest in value stocks. Both &quot;growth&quot; and &quot;value&quot;
styles have their proponents. But what's most important to remember is that they
tend to trade in cycles, with one style being in favor and the other style out
of favor. Therefore, by diversifying with stocks of both types, you may be able
to reduce the overall volatility of your portfolio over the long term.<BR>

suggest a future investment-related topic for discussion, please send us an

<H3>Ask the Portfolio Manager</H3>

<P>
<B>This month's question:</B> The U.S. dollar always seems to bounce around versus foreign currencies. What effect does this have on international funds?
<P>
<B>Respondent:</B> Shirish Malekar, portfolio manager of the Strong Short-Term Global Bond Fund and the Strong International Bond Fund.
<P>
"The value of the dollar can have a big impact on the returns of foreign investments. Here's why: Let's say you want to buy a Japanese stock. To do so, you must first exchange your dollars for yen. When you sell the stock, you must convert the yen back into dollars. If the dollar falls 10% against the yen, you'll get 10% <I>more</I> dollars if you sell your stock -- a 10% gain. Of course, if the dollar <I>rose</I> against the yen, your Japanese stock would be worth fewer dollars, and you'd suffer a loss. This currency risk can make the returns on foreign investments quite volatile. Fortunately, you can reduce this volatility thorough <I>diversification</I>. By diversifying your portfolio to include a number of markets, you reduce the dollar's impact on any single currency. In short, to give yourself access to the return potential of international markets -- and also sleep at night -- the key is <I>diversification</I>."

<P><B>This month's question: </B>Why does the stock market seem to go down
whenever there are reports of the economy growing stronger?
</P>
<P><B>Respondent:</B> Brad Tank, Strong Funds&#146; Director of Fixed Income
Securities, portfolio manager of the Strong Government Securities Fund, and
portfolio co-manager of the Strong Short-Term Bond Fund.</P>
<P>&quot;When average investors hear reports about a growing economy, they tend
to feel optimistic. But when investment professionals hear that same &quot;good
news,&quot; they tend to worry. That&#146;s because the professionals are paid
to anticipate the future. Often, they believe that good economic news means that
the economy may start to grow <I>too</I> fast, leading to higher inflation, a
negative for financial assets like stocks and bonds. So good news may prompt
selling by those who believe that the securities they hold have peaked in value,
at least for the near term. However, the bottom line is this: if you&#146;re
investing for something that&#146;s at least three or four years away, these
short-term ups and downs are probably immaterial to achieving your goals. Your
sanity (and, chances are, your portfolio) are better off when you stay focused
on the long term.&quot;

<P>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="4">Investing: A Long-Term Commitment</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Tending a garden, raising a child...learning a musical
instrument... all these activities have a fundamental element in common:
each is a <I>process</I>, not a one-time event.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The same is true of investing for a major goal. It's an endeavor
that must be pursued with logic, patience, and diligence over a long period,
often decades. Of course, being disciplined about investing is seldom easy.
Sometimes, short-term needs interfere with your plans, or the markets appear
to be headed for a downturn, or, sometimes, you may simply forget to add
to your account.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE="3">Fortunately, there's a way to help make discipline easier:
start an Automatic Investment Plan (AIP).</FONT></I>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="4">Take Control Of The Process With An AIP</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">An Automatic Investment Plan lets you automatically transfer
a pre-set amount of money from your bank account into a fund you choose at
regular intervals. You determine how much you want to invest, and how often.
In doing so, you purchase shares of the Fund at its then current share price.
Once you start your plan, it continues to make investments automatically,
so you don't have to worry about it. You work toward your goals step by step,
consistently, over time.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In addition to helping you organize the process of investing,
an Automatic Investment Plan offers several important advantages that may
boost your chances of reaching your important goals.</FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif"><FONT SIZE="3"><A HREF="#_wmh3_831413491">You
"Pay yourself first"</A><BR>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif"><A HREF="#_wmh3_831413520">You may

<IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif"><A HREF="#_wmh3_831413575">You don't
put off investing - featuring our Power of Compounding Calculator</A></FONT>
<H3>
  <I><A NAME="_wmh3_831413491">You "Pay yourself first."</A></I>
</H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Because it's automatic, an AIP ensures that you attend to
your long-term goals before you're tempted to spend those assets on a new
suit or a set of golf clubs. An AIP gives investing for your future the same
importance as your other periodic payments - your monthly bills, for example.
As a result, you're much more likely to stick with your plan until you reach
your goal. It's a great way to save three years for a down payment on a house,
or thirty years for retirement.</FONT>
<H3>
  <I><A NAME="_wmh3_831413520">You may reduce your average cost of
  investing.</A></I>
</H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">When you invest the same amount in a fund at regular intervals
over time, you buy more shares when the price is lower. Thus, you may reduce
your average cost per share over time. This strategy, called "dollar cost
averaging," helps make market fluctuations work <I>for</I> you, and reduces
the risk that you'll invest all your money right before a market
downturn.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Dollar cost averaging offers its greatest benefit with investments
that tend to regularly fluctuate in price, which is why Automatic Investment
Plans can be especially effective when used in conjunction with stock funds.
The share price of these funds can vary widely, but, through dollar cost
averaging, an AIP can make this volatility work<I> for</I> you. You gain
access to the stock market's growth potential, and you may reduce your cost
of investing over the long term.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">You should keep in mind that dollar cost averaging can't guarantee
a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. So choose an amount
you feel comfortable investing under all market conditions.</FONT>
<H3>
  <I><A NAME="_wmh3_831413575">You don't put off investing.</A></I>
</H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">It's easy to delay investing until you believe the time is
"right." But putting off investing means you're not utilizing one of the
most potent benefits available to long-term investors: <B>the power of
compounding</B>. When you reinvest your dividends and capital gains, they
can add considerably to the growth potential of your investment over time.
And the longer you invest, the greater the effect of compounding
becomes:</FONT>

<H3><A NAME="_wmh3_829605233">Advantages of a SEP-IRA </A></H3>
<P>A SEP-IRA enables you to establish a company-funded retirement program for
yourself without the administrative expense, government reporting requirements,
and complexity associated with many other types of retirement plans. It
offers other advantages too: </P>
<P><B>Flexibility. </B>Other than the 15% contribution limit for 1996 (of the first $150,000 of
your compensation), there are no annual contribution requirements. You can
contribute 5% one year, 10% the next, and even skip a year if you want.
Also, because you have until the due date (including extensions) for filing
your federal income tax return to establish or contribute to a SEP-IRA,
you have time to get a clear picture of your business's financial status
first. </P>
<P>If you are self-employed and are age 70 1/2 or older, you can still contribute
to a SEP-IRA even though you can no longer contribute to a regular IRA. </P>
<P><B>Simplicity. </B>Unlike qualified plans, no extra IRA or government reporting is required.
Just fill out the simple Form 5305-SEP and file it with your personal records.
(Form 5305-SEP is included in Strong's SEP-IRA investment kit, which may
be <A HREF="/strong/html/regular.ht1">ordered through regular mail</A> or by calling 1-800-359-3379).  You may then take a deduction on your federal
income tax return for your SEP-IRA contribution. </P>
<P><B>Low cost.</B> With a Strong SEP-IRA, there is no set-up fee to establish your plan. </P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="_wmh3_829605405">Who Should Consider a SEP-IRA? </A></H3>
<P>If you are self-employed and earn income, you can establish a SEP-IRA. If
you want to contribute up to 15% of your pre-tax income to a retirement
plan, a SEP-IRA may be especially useful. Consider a SEP-IRA if you: </P>
<P><IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif">own your own business -- your business can be incorporated or unincorporated,
or a Subchapter S corporation. <BR>
 <IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif">farm, consult or free-lance. <BR>
 <IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif">have income from work you do &quot;on the side&quot; such as acting or selling your

<P>You can contribute income from part-time services even if you're already

<H3><A NAME="_wmh3_829605376">Determining Your Contribution </A></H3>
<P>For self-employed individuals, calculating the SEP-IRA contribution is a

      Employment-Income IRA (Regular IRA)
    </H3>
    <P>
    <STRONG><I>Investor Profile</I></STRONG>: You have employment income, and
    you won't turn age 70&#189; until after December 31 of this year. <BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>IRA Type</I></STRONG>: You can open a regular IRA for the current
    tax year. If both you and your spouse work, each of you may establish your
    own IRA, making contributions based on your separate incomes.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Annual Contribution Limit</I></STRONG>: $2,000 per IRA.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Deductibility</I></STRONG>: Depending on your income level and
    whether you already participate in a retirement plan at work, your contribution
    may be at least partially tax-deductible. Please see

    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Annual Contribution Limit</I></STRONG>: <B>Prior to January 1,
    1997</B>, you may contribute no more than $2,250 of earned income between
    both IRAs (yours and your spouse's), with a maximum of $2,000 in one account.
    For example, you could invest $1,000 in your IRA and $1,250 in your spouse's.
    <B>After January 1, 1997</B>, the annual contribution limit is $4,000, with

    retirement-plan distribution -- except for any after-tax contributions you
    may have made -- from your former employer's plan directly into a Strong
    IRA.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Rollover Contribution Limit</I></STRONG>: Unlimited.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Deductibility</I></STRONG>: While a rollover IRA isn't deductible,
    your assets aren't taxed, so your nest egg will remain intact and continue
    to grow tax-deferred.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Note</I></STRONG>: A <I>direct</I> rollover helps you avoid the
    20% withholding that the government assesses on distributions that are eligible
    to be rolled over into an IRA but are instead received in cash or check form.

    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Note</I></STRONG>: Aside from its higher contribution allowance
    and deductibility, a SEP-IRA is generally subject to the same rules as a
    regular IRA. Also, note that establishing a SEP doesn't preclude you or your
    employees from owning individual IRAs, as well.<BR>

      Salary Reduction SEP-IRA (SARSEP-IRA)

    <STRONG><I>Investor Profile</I></STRONG>: You own a business employing 25
    or fewer people.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>IRA Type</I></STRONG>: You can set up a SARSEP-IRA, which allows
    your employees to make IRA contributions directly out of their salaries.
    This can be in addition to those provided by the employer through a SEP-IRA
    -- and in addition to their individual IRAs.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Annual Contribution Limit</I></STRONG>: Salary deferral of $9,500
    (for 1996), adjusted annually. In addition, if an employer makes contributions
    into a SEP-IRA, the combination of the two plans cannot be more than 15%
    of an employee's annual compensation or more than $22,500, whichever is less.
    At least 50% of employees must participate in the plan. <BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Deductibility</I></STRONG>: Contributions are deducted directly
    from compensation and are therefore not taxed until withdrawal. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B><STRONG><I>Please Note</I></STRONG>: Effective December 31, 1996</B>,
    employers will no longer be able to establish a SARSEP-IRA. Those employers
    who have established a plan by this deadline will be able to maintain their
    existing accounts. A new simplified retirement plan for small businesses
    called the Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) is effective
    for years beginning after December 31, 1996. For any additional questions,
    please contact a Strong Retirement Plans Specialist at 1-800-368-3001 from

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="plan">What is a 403(b) plan?</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR> Named after the section of the federal Internal Revenue Code that
authorizes this type of program, a 403(b) plan is a special tax-advantaged
retirement plan for employees of certain tax-exempt organizations and
educational institutions. Generally, a 403(b) plan can be either a 403(b)(1)
tax-sheltered annuity contract (TSA) issued by an insurer or a 403(b)(7)
custodial account invested exclusively in mutual fund shares. Either type of
403(b) plan allows you to make pre-tax contributions, taken from your paycheck,
to a special retirement annuity or custodial account set up specifically in your
name.<BR>
<BR> 403(b) plans are designed exclusively for employees of certain non-profit
organizations such as:<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Hospitals and health care organizations<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Charitable and other foundations<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Churches and other religious
organizations<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Literary and art institutions<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">&#183;</FONT></B> Educational institutions, including
colleges, universities, public and private schools, and technical and vocational
institutions.<BR>
<BR> A 403(b) plan is funded through a voluntary salary reduction agreement
between you and your organization. You decide how much you want to contribute to
your account and how often, subject to certain IRS limits. Then, the amount you
want to save is automatically deducted from your paycheck on a before-tax basis
and allocated to the investments you select. It's that simple.<BR>
</P>
<P></P>
<P>  </P>
<HR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="power">Retirement Planning
Power</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR> A 403(b) plan gives you the unique opportunity to accumulate substantially
greater savings than through comparable taxable investment. Here's why:<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"> <B><FONT COLOR="#000080"> You pay
yourself first.</FONT></B> Your 403(b)       contributions are automatically
withdrawn from your paycheck on a regular       basis -- you don't need to write
a check. And there's no burdensome paperwork       to worry about. You can relax
knowing that each pay period, investing for       your retirement is given the
priority it deserves.<BR>
<IMG SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif"><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"> You pay less in
current taxes.</FONT></B> When you       contribute to a 403(b) plan, you
actually lower your taxable income. That's       because your contributions are
deducted from your salary before taxes are       taken out. This will enable you
to pay taxes on a smaller portion of your       salary. And you pay no federal
income tax on your contributions until you       take a distribution, typically
at retirement. The result? It actually costs       you less to save. To
illustrate, assume you contribute $100 each month to       your retirement
account:   <BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="diverse">The Importance of
Diversification</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR> Investment choices you make today will affect the type of retirement
you'll enjoy in the future. No single investment is right for everyone. Before
you select your 403(b) investments, you'll want to carefully consider how much
you want your investments to earn and how much risk you're willing to accept in
order to achieve those earnings. By spreading your 403(b) assets over a variety
of investments that have different return potentials and risk levels, you may be
able to reduce the impact a decline in any one investment may have on your
entire portfolio. As a result, diversification may also help increase your
portfolio's overall return potential over time.<BR>
<BR> Our sample <A HREF="/strong/Retirement/5pies.htm">five model portfolios</A>
are intended to illustrate how asset allocation can work for you. When comparing
asset allocation models to your personal financial situation, you should
consider all of your assets, income and investments, in addition to your
retirement assets.<BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="+1"><A NAME="answers">Answers to
Commonly-Asked Questions</A></FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Who is eligible to participate in a 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Generally, employees of public schools or tax-exempt organizations
described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are eligible to
participate in 403(b) plans. Employers that are qualified to sponsor 403(b)
plans include hospitals, health care organizations, churches and other religious
organizations, colleges, universities, public and private schools, and certain
other non-profit organizations. You should consult with your employer to
determine whether or not it is qualified to sponsor a 403(b) plan, and whether
you're eligible to participate.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What types of funding arrangements are available for 403(b) plans?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Two types of funding arrangements are most commonly used for 403(b)
plans: <B>(1)</B> 403(b)(1) annuity contracts issued by insurance companies;
and <B>(2)</B> 403(b)(7) custodial accounts invested exclusively in mutual
funds. Employers may make one or both types of 403(b) funding arrangements
available to their eligible employees. Many individuals select mutual funds for
their 403(b) accounts, however, because of the professional management,
diversification, liquidity, flexibility and convenience they offer investors.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What types of contributions may be made to a 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> You may make pre-tax &quot;elective deferral&quot; contributions to
your 403(b) plan in accordance with your salary reduction agreement. In
addition, your organization may make &quot;non-elective&quot; contributions to
your 403(b) plan. All contributions to your 403(b) plan &amp;endash; whether
salary reduction contributions or non-elective employer contributions &amp;endash;
will be excluded from your current year gross income for federal income tax
purposes, only if they do not exceed certain limitations established by the IRS.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: How much can I contribute to my 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Generally, the maximum amount that may be contributed to your 403(b)
account each year, and excluded from your current year's gross income for
federal income tax purposes, depends upon a number of factors, including prior
retirement plan contributions, compensation, and years of service. Generally,
for any tax year, contributions to your 403(b) account are excludable from your
federal gross income to the extent they do not exceed the smallest of the
following three limits, whichever applies: <B>(1)</B> the annual dollar limit
on elective deferrals ($9,500 for the 1996 tax year); <B>(2)</B> your &quot;exclusion
allowance&quot; for the year'; and <B>(3)</B> the overall limit on
contributions (generally, the lesser of $30,000 or 25% of your compensation for
the year). However, there are special &quot;catch-up&quot; elections that may
increase the $9,500 elective deferral limit in certain years. Please contact
either your tax advisor, or obtain IRS Publication 571, to determine your
maximum allowable contribution.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What happens if I contribute more than the allowable limit?</B><BR> A:
So-called &quot;excess elective deferrals&quot; (generally, salary reduction
contributions over $9,500 per year or, any higher limit under a special &quot;catch-up&quot;
election) are included in your federal gross income for the tax year in which
they were made. If the plan allows, you can withdraw the excess elective
deferrals (plus earnings) by April 15 of the following year. If you do, the
excess elective deferrals will not have to be included in your federal gross
income for the year of the distribution, but the distributed earnings must be
included. So-called &quot;excess contributions&quot; (i.e., salary reduction and
non-elective employer contributions that exceed applicable annual limitations)
are included in your federal gross income for the tax year in which they were
made, and the excess reduces your exclusion allowance for future years, even
though the excess has already been included in your income.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: How often can I change my contribution amount?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> According to IRS regulations which recently changed on January 1, 1996,
there is no limit to the number of times you may make or change your salary
reduction agreement.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Can I transfer my existing assets from another 403(b) plan?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes. Generally speaking, you may transfer your existing 403(b) plan
assets to another 403(b) Retirement Plan without penalty, assuming your existing
plan and IRS rules permit transfers. You'll want to check with your organization
and tax advisor for additional details.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: Can I also contribute to an IRA?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Absolutely, although you'll want to maximize your contributions to
your 403(b) plan first. You can only contribute up to a maximum of $2,000 (or
100% of compensation if less than $2,000) each year to an Individual Retirement
Account. However, your ability to deduct IRA contributions may be affected by
your (or your spouse's) participation in any other retirement plan. If you and
your spouse file a joint income tax return; have an adjusted gross income of
more than $40,000; and at least one of you is covered by a retirement plan, you
lose some or all of your IRA income tax deduction.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q: What if I change employers?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Because all pre-tax salary reduction contributions you make to your
403(b) account are 100% vested immediately, you may be able to continue making
such contributions to your 403(b) account by signing a new salary reduction
agreement with your new employer. If your new employer is not eligible to offer
a 403(b) plan, you can let your existing 403(b) account grow tax-deferred even
though you may not currently make contributions.<BR>

</PRE>
<P>

Congratulations! Your new job is likely to be an important step in your career. In the excitement and activity of changing companies, however, you may be missing a very important opportunity -- one you can't afford to overlook.
<P>
If you were a participant in your previous employer's qualified retirement plan, you may be eligible to receive a check for the savings you accumulated. What will you do with that &quot;lump-sum distribution?&quot; Even if the amount seems modest, what you saved or your employer contributed on your behalf still represents important assets you'll need for retirement -- assets you'll want to protect and grow. 
<P>
Yet many people are tempted to spend all or part of their distribution. Others, in the hustle and bustle of transition, don't give this important decision much thought. Either can be a costly mistake. Consider this:
<P>
<B>
<DL>
<DD>If you're planning to spend -- rather than roll over -- the payout from your qualified retirement plan, you could lose as much as half of your retirement nest egg to taxes and IRS penalties.</DD>
</DL>
</B>
<P>
That's why it's important to know the benefits of allowing whatever you've accumulated so far to continue growing tax-deferred. And why it's also important to know the tax rules associated with retirement-plan rollovers.

Regardless of the amount you receive, this money will likely represent a lifetime
of hard work, and will probably come from someone who cared dearly about you.
Most people see such an inheritance as a &quot;windfall.&quot; But others
appreciate that it should be considered part of their savings &#150; money that
may enable them to live better in retirement and, in time, may be passed on to
another generation.</FONT>

SIZE="+2">B</FONT></FONT></B></FONT>ecause someone worked very hard to earn
your inheritance, you have a responsibility, a moral obligation, to handle it
prudently and wisely. So it's important not to adopt an &quot;easy come, easy go&quot;
attitude that could put this money &#150; and your own retirement &#150; at
risk. Here's a case in point: On a recent, chilly spring night, I was walking
out of a local Italian restaurant, having just concluded a casual business
dinner, when I bumped into Charlie, the restaurant's pizza delivery man. Knowing
what I did for a living, Charlie wanted to ask my opinion on an investment
matter. His wife had just inherited over $10,000 &#150; virtually all the money
they had &#150; and he was considering investing every penny in shares of
Netscape, a dynamic newcomer in the Internet search-software business. What did
I think? I suggested that he reconsider this highly aggressive investment
approach. Investing all their available assets in a company and industry he knew
very little about didn't seem like the </TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">right thing to do &#150; and perhaps it was why he was
wondering whether it was a good idea.  Instead, I suggested to Charlie that he
consider picking not one company, but <I>several</I> &#150; specifically, some
local companies that he could relate to. Or he could diversify further by
investing in a mutual fund with a lengthy track record. 	Charlie's situation is
hardly an isolated case &#150; inexperienced investors (and sometimes even
experienced ones) can be tempted to try to &quot;hit a home run&quot; when they
make investment decisions. However, to be successful over time, you must
exercise sound judgment. Whether you inherit the money you invest or earn it
yourself, it takes careful consideration to make it an effective part of your
portfolio. After all, you don't want to throw caution to the wind when your
future &#150; your ability to achieve a secure and comfortable retirement &#150;
is at stake. Stocks are typically where individual investors can get into
trouble. People are generally aware that, throughout this century,</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">the stock market has experienced extraordinary growth. But
they are unaware of how this growth was achieved &#150; it has never been a
straight line and it never will be. There will be bumps and jolts, and to
weather the storm, investors must build a diversified portfolio of quality
investments. In times of market volatility and uncertainty, the knowledge that
you've invested in companies and mutual funds that you know and are comfortable
with can help you keep a long-term perspective, and &#150; no small benefit &#150;
help you sleep soundly at night.  Getting rich quick may be part of the
American dream, but that's not how to approach investing for retirement.
Achieving that type of goal takes a thoughtful, diversified strategy. And it
takes knowing the difference between grasping for quick gains, and investing
successfully for your own retirement and, perhaps, the future comfort of your
loved ones.

recent months, the bond market has appeared to experience a particularly
volatile period. One day, weaker-than-expected numbers prompted headlines that
interest rates are too high and a recession may be on the way. The next day,
stronger-than-expected economic numbers generated claims of renewed growth and
higher inflation around the corner. What should individual investors make of
this flurry of contradictions? Probably the most important thing to do is to put
recent numbers into historical perspective. To do that, let&#146;s look at how
the economy has performed over the last three decades. Below, you&#146;ll find a
chart of the nation&#146;s gross domestic product (GDP) since 1960. If you look
at the chart, you&#146;ll note something interesting: Prior to 1983, the line
fluctuates widely, indicating a volatile economy marked by powerful growth
spurts and deep recessions. After 1983, however, the peaks and troughs become
less pronounced &#150; suggesting that the economy has become more stable.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP"> One reason for this is that, prior to 1983, the Federal
Reserve tended to respond to economic changes after a clear direction was
already established. In some cases, the Fed&#146;s intervention actually made
matters worse. In recent years, however, the Fed has tried to anticipate the
direction of the economy&#146;s growth, raising and lowering short-term interest
rates in an effort to keep the economy from growing too quickly or slowing too
rapidly. Because the market also tries to anticipate future growth, the Fed and
the market have more often been &quot;on the same page.&quot; The net effect has
been a less volatile economy, as the chart shows. While the Fed is not solely
responsible for the reduction in economic volatility (structural changes, such
as better inventory management by companies, have also contributed), we believe
the Fed certainly deserves some credit for the smoother sailing we&#146;ve
experienced.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">What, then, is behind the market&#146;s current volatility? At
Strong, our view is that investors are focusing on extremely short-term changes
in the economy, which is helping to exacerbate market swings.  It&#146;s
important not to focus on the &quot;bad old days,&quot; when a reactive Fed
contributed to significantly wider cycles in the economy. Clearly, such cycles
haven&#146;t been evident for more than a decade. In fact, except for a down
draft precipitated in part by the Persian Gulf war, the economy&#146;s growth
rate has hovered between 0 percent and 5 percent since late 1984.  So we believe
current volatility, when it results in a bump-up in rates, represents a buying
opportunity. Longer-term data suggests to us that investors can anticipate a
relatively slow-growth economy characterized by low inflation and fundamentally
stable, if sometimes choppy, interest rates.

<BR>OFTEN, WHEN PEOPLE find out what business I'm in, they begin telling me
all about their latest investment moves - looking for validation, I suppose.
Over breakfast at a local coffee shop the other day, my waitress was no
different.<BR>
 <BR>
 <B>S</B>tarting with her 401(k) plan, she laid out, in great detail, every twist
and turn of her financial road map. It occurred to me that she, like many
people today, was making retirement planning much more complicated than
it needs to be.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">When I start to overcomplicate things, I think back to previous generations
- and how so many things we take for granted today would've been completely
inconceivable for my mom's dad, Grandfather Flint. Like reliable jet travel.
Cash machines. Cellular phones. Or peace with Russia. All these developments
have had a huge impact on the way we live our lives. We simply can't ignore
the fact that today's trends, innovations, and political conflicts similarly
will affect our future - and future generations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">In the face of all this change, investors often have one of two reactions:
1) They overplan, like my waitress friend, building complex, multi-layered,
asset-allocation models - and probably a false sense of security. Or 2)
they underplan, falling prey to what I call check-a-box syndrome, hoping
their selection of a single investment - any investment - will allow them
to hunker down in their comfort zones and ignore the risks and opportunities
around them.</FONT></P>
<CENTER><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="3">
</P>
</CENTER><CENTER><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="3">&quot;The comfort imparted by a financial plan should come from its common-sense
practicality, not from its complexity.&quot;</TD></TR>
 </FONT></P>
</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="3"></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">My 30 years in this business have reinforced a lesson taught to me originally
by Grandfather Flint: Keep It Simple, Son.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">Successful long-term financial planning requires striving for consistent,
predictable returns over time, even as the world and its economies change
faster than most of us can fathom. That means staying diversified and making
use of three key tools: stocks, bonds, and cash.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">If you're looking for a place to start, consider splitting your holdings
evenly among the three. The markets have posted tremendous gains since 1982,
with returns over the past decade far outpacing the historical averages.
An all-out commitment to stocks is probably not as wise today as it was
ten years ago. While you should consider you own unique situation, the simple,
&quot;three thirds&quot; approach may help you maintain a healthy exposure to stocks,
while also instilling a sense of balance and discipline - two qualities
my grandfather would have admired. And two qualities that are vital for
keeping one's sanity - fiscal and otherwise - amidst the changes that are
bound to come.</FONT></P>

RETIREMENT . . . A FIRST HOME . . . a child's education. When you're still
in your 20s and your financial goals seem overwhelming, where do you begin
an investment program? How much money do you need to start? Where do you
find the extra sums to build a portfolio? Elli Dai, a manager in Strong's
marketing department, and her husband Tony, a full-time student and Army
reservist, started with a list of goals, a set of priorities, and a healthy
dose of discipline. </FONT></P>
<HR>
<CENTER><P ALIGN="CENTER">
<FONT SIZE="3">&quot;They must act today to build the foundation for a lifetime of financial
goals.&quot;</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="3"> </FONT></P>
</CENTER><P></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="3">L</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="3">ike many young couples, Elli (age 25) and Tony (age 27) Dai have a long
wishlist of financial goals - a first home, funds they can count on in an
emergency, a college fund for their 4 year old son, Jordan, and retirement
security. Also, like many of their peers, they have limited resources to
commit toward their objectives. But in the Dais' case, there is extraordinary
incentive to save and invest so they can turn their dreams into realities. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">&quot;In this business, you hear too often about people in their 40s, 50s - and
even 60s - with little or no savings,&quot; explains Elli. &quot;They're understandably
worried about their futures,&quot; she adds. &quot;It really gets you thinking about
the need to invest on a regular basis - even if you have to start small.
That, more than anything else, motivated us to start early.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="3">Investments put on auto-pilot</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="3">A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="3">s the ancient Chinese proverb states, a journey of 1,000 miles begins with
one step. The Dais took their first step by taking advantage of Strong's
No-Minimum Investment Plan, opening an account in a conservative equity
fund by setting up monthly automatic investments directly from their checking
account.1 </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">Once on their way, the Dais were determined to build from this foundation
by remaining disciplined and focused on their goals. &quot;Early on, we made
a conscious decision to maintain the same standard of living - regardless
of salary increases - until Tony graduates from college,&quot; says Elli. To
avoid the temptation to spend Elli's raises, the couple made a pact: they
agreed to commit 85 percent of each salary increase to building their investment
portfolio. Today, they have investments in eight funds and have increased
their monthly automatic investments 13-fold.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">Like every financial plan, the Dais' program requires that they periodically
check their progress, evaluate their goals, and reallocate funds. &quot;We sit
at the kitchen table a couple times a year and review our goals to make
sure we're on target,&quot; Elli explains. &quot;For example, we've been investing
for the last two-and-a-half years for a down payment on our first house.
So far, most of that money has been in fairly conservative equity funds.
Right now, we're comfortable with that, but soon - as we get closer to accumulating
the sum we think we'll need - we plan to shift that money into shorter-term,
less volatile funds.&quot; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">That's why these kitchen-table sessions are so valuable. They enable the
Dais to take stock of how far they've come and what they need to do to go
the distance. </FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="3">Money earmarked for college</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="3">A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="3"> basic principle of the Dais' investment regimen is that it's easier to
save money when you make a habit of doing so. &quot;We're big believers in `paying
ourselves first,'&quot; says Elli. That includes paying their young son, Jordan,
too. Though the youngster has 14 years until he graduates high school, the
couple has already started investing for his college expenses. They make
monthly contributions to a Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) account
in an aggressive stock fund generally recommended for long-term investment
horizons. While there is some risk that the UTMA could limit Jordan's eligibility
for financial aid - since the account is in his name - says Elli, &quot;we wanted
to make sure we wouldn't be tempted to raid Jordan's funds to pay for shorter-term
needs.&quot; </FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="3">Retirement planning</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="3">A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="3">lthough they're just starting out, the Dais have the foresight to look forward
to, and plan for, their retirement. Elli participates in the 401(k) plan
at work, investing in a mix of domestic and international growth funds.
When Tony graduates from college next year and gains full-time employment,
the couple plans to fund individual IRAs annually. And, not surprisingly,
they took a disciplined approach when Tony received a lump-sum payment a
few years ago from his former employer's pension plan. Rather than spend
it, they rolled the distribution directly into a growth-fund IRA.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">While many of their friends still fear the stock market and most forms of
structured investment, the Dais are off to a good start with consistent
investments in a diversified portfolio. They recognize they must act today
to build the foundation for a lifetime of financial goals.</FONT></P>
<P><I><FONT SIZE="3">We'd like to thank the Dais for sharing their portfolio strategy with us.
Of course, you should consider your own unique financial circumstances before
you design an investment plan.</FONT></I></P>
<P><I><FONT SIZE="3">*Strong's No-Minimum Investment Plan requires a commitment of at least
$50 per month. </FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE="3">Brad Tank, Strong's director of fixed-income securities, answers your questions
about the economics of investing.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="3"></FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="3">Investor:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="3"> The national budget debates have been making headlines for months now,
but they leave me wondering: <I>Does a &quot;balanced budget&quot; have significance for the average investor?</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="/strong/images/tank.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="89" HEIGHT="116" SGI_SETWIDTH SGI_SETHEIGHT SGI_FULLPATH="/usr/var/www/htdocs/legal/news/tank.gif"><B>Brad Tank: </B>Absolutely. Every budget has two sides: revenues and expenses. For our federal
budget, the issue of <I>how</I> we fund the government's spending is in itself important. But it is part
of the larger - and more critical - issue of how big a government should
be. Perhaps the most important development in the global economy in the
1990s is the recognition there's an optimal range of government size needed
to support a dynamic economy. The balanced-budget debate is significant
precisely because it brings this issue - the size and scope of the federal
government - into focus. Let me clarify.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="11" SGI_SETWIDTH SGI_SETHEIGHT SGI_FULLPATH="/usr/var/www/htdocs/legal/news/workingr.gif"><FONT SIZE="3">In countries where government accounts for a huge share of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) - as much as 70 percent in social democracies like Sweden
- the economies are suffering or, at best, limping along.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="/strong/images/workingr.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="11" SGI_SETWIDTH SGI_SETHEIGHT SGI_FULLPATH="/usr/var/www/htdocs/legal/news/workingr.gif"><FONT SIZE="3">But where government is small relative to the GDP - such as Hong Kong (12
percent) - just the opposite is true. These economies are thriving.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">Currently, the U.S. government accounts for 22 percent of the GDP. Recent
budget proposals from both the Congressional Republicans and President Clinton
would further reduce the relative size of the federal government over the
next seven years to approximately 19 percent of the GDP.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">Such a reduction could be good news for business and, ultimately, for stock
prices. Certainly, other critical factors - for example, a slowdown in corporate
earnings - could negatively affect the short-term outlook for stocks. But,
as long as taxes remain in check, the promise of a smaller government should
prove a powerful engine for the U.S. economy.</FONT></P>

<P><BR> Many investors overlook the importance of managing the &quot;cash&quot;
portion of their portfolios. Often, they let large amounts of short-term assets
remain in low-yielding accounts for extended periods of time. There is, however,
a smarter way to think about investing these assets. This approach -- known as
cash management -- has long been used by private banking institutions and
corporate finance departments. Now, with specialized money market funds and
ultra-short bond funds, this approach is available to a wider range of
investors.
</P>
<P><B>Four Steps to Managing Your Cash More Effectively</B><BR>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/one.gif"> <B>Divide your cash into
two groups.</B> The first step toward getting the most out of your cash is to
think of it in terms of two separate and distinct categories:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>    <B><I>Current Cash</I></B> -- the portion you generally put aside to
cover     regular transactions and routine expenditures and to save for goals
less     than one year away.<BR>    
<P>  </P></LI>
<LI>    <B><I>Portfolio Cash</I></B> -- the portion you tend to keep
untouched in     your portfolio for extended periods. Usually, it's used as a
savings vehicle     for goals between one and two years away, to cover
unforeseen emergencies,     or as a permanent, conservative position in your
investment portfolio.<BR>    
<P></P></LI></UL>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/two.gif"> <B>Consider all your
options.</B> Many investors keep current cash and portfolio cash in &quot;convenience&quot;
money funds, which typically require low minimum initial investments, offer an
array of services (such as free check writing), and provide relatively low
return potential. However, there are other options:<BR>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>    <B><I>Higher-Yielding Money Funds</I></B> -- these vehicles offer
more income     potential than &quot;convenience&quot; money funds. To pursue
higher yields, they often     entail certain restrictions, such as higher
balance requirements and charges     for transactions.<BR>    
<P>  </P></LI>
<LI>    <B><I>Ultra-Short Funds</I></B> -- designed to provide higher yields
than     money funds generally offer, these funds invest in bonds that have
longer     maturities and, in some cases, lower credit ratings. Unlike money
market     funds, the share price of an ultra-short fund will vary, although
most strive     to minimize fluctuation by maintaining very short average
portfolio maturities     -- usually less than one year.<BR>    
<P></P></LI></UL>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/three.gif"> <B>Allocate your cash
based on how you intend to use it.</B> The key to managing your cash effectively
is to allocate it according to how you expect to use it. Certainly, it's wise to
keep your current cash in an investment that allows you to withdraw it without
penalities and without tax consequences. But you can supplement that current
cash position with higher-yielding short-term vehicles that enable you to earn
more on your portfolio cash -- the money that tends to remain untouched in your
portfolio for more than a year.<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/four.gif"> <B>Consider municipal
investing.</B> You may be able to further enhance the return potential of your
cash by investing in a municipal bond fund. Because the income these funds
produce is exempt from federal income tax, you get to keep more of what you
earn, effectively increasing your investment returns.<BR>

<P><A HREF="Our_Funds/Cash_Management/cashprot.ht1">The Strong Cash Management
Funds</A> are designed to give you the tools you need to put your
cash-management plan into action.<BR>
</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Strong Money Market Choices</B><BR>
</P>
<P>The money market funds in this group are designed to give you a variety of
conservative money fund options. Like all money market funds, they are managed
to maintain a stable $1.00 share price, although there can be no guarantee that
they will be able to do so. They invest at least 95% of their assets in &quot;first
tier&quot; money market securities and maintain average maturities of 90 days or
less.<BR>

Market Fund</A> invests only in high-quality, short-term municipal obligations

</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif">
<A HREF="Our_Funds/Cash_Management/hmfprfl.ht1">The Strong Heritage Money Fund</A>
seeks to provide a yield that, over time, is higher than the typical money fund.
To do so, it's structured to keep expenses low -- since expenses directly affect
a money fund's yield. The Fund therefore requires higher balances and, with
certain exceptions, charges a fee for individual transactions.<BR>
</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Strong Ultra-Short Choices</B><BR>
</P>
<P>To enhance the yield potential of your portfolio cash, Strong also offers
two ultra-short bond funds. In pursuit of higher yields than money funds
generally provide, both funds normally maintain a slightly longer average
maturity than money funds -- up to one year -- and may invest a limited amount
of assets in lower-rated bonds. Through exhaustive credit research, the funds'
managers seek to further enhance potential return and reduce potential
share-price fluctuation. Please note, however, that the share prices of these
funds do fluctuate, unlike those of money market funds.<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif">
<A HREF="Our_Funds/Cash_Management/advprfl.ht1">The Strong Advantage Fund</A>
invests primarily in ultra-short government bonds, mortgage-backed bonds, and
investment-grade corporate bonds. The Fund's average effective portfolio
maturity of is restricted to one year or less.<BR>
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="/strong/images/bbtn.gif">
<A HREF="html/Our_Funds/Cash_Management/madvprfl.ht1">The Strong Municipal
Advantage Fund</A> is the first mutual fund designed to combine the potential
benefits of ultra-short and municipal investing. Like the Strong Advantage Fund,
it maintains an ultra-short maturity of one year or less. However, the Municipal
Advantage Fund invests primarily in municipal bonds, so its income is exempt
from federal income tax.<BR>

The <B> <FONT COLOR="000080">Strong Heritage Money Fund</FONT></B> seeks
current income, a stable share price, and daily liquidity. The Fund invests
in corporate, bank, and government instruments that present minimal credit
risk. Designed to provide a yield that, over time, is higher than typical
money funds, the Fund is structured to keep costs low. The Fund requires
investors to maintain account balances of at least $25,000, enabling it to
take advantage of certain economies of scale. With certain exceptions, the
Fund also charges fees for individual transactions. <BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1><I> Please note: an investment in the Fund is neither insured
nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, and there can be no assurance that
the Fund will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per
share.</I></FONT>

</PRE>
<P>

Congratulations! Your new job is likely to be an important step in your career. In the excitement and activity of changing companies, however, you may be missing a very important opportunity -- one you can't afford to overlook.
<P>
If you were a participant in your previous employer's qualified retirement plan, you may be eligible to receive a check for the savings you accumulated. What will you do with that &quot;lump-sum distribution?&quot; Even if the amount seems modest, what you saved or your employer contributed on your behalf still represents important assets you'll need for retirement -- assets you'll want to protect and grow. 
<P>
Yet many people are tempted to spend all or part of their distribution. Others, in the hustle and bustle of transition, don't give this important decision much thought. Either can be a costly mistake. Consider this:
<P>
<B>
<DL>
<DD>If you're planning to spend -- rather than roll over -- the payout from your qualified retirement plan, you could lose as much as half of your retirement nest egg to taxes and IRS penalties.</DD>
</DL>
</B>
<P>
That's why it's important to know the benefits of allowing whatever you've accumulated so far to continue growing tax-deferred. And why it's also important to know the tax rules associated with retirement-plan rollovers.

<P>Many people believe that investing conservatively is the best way to save 
for retirement. However, such investments historically haven't earned much  more
than the inflation rate over time. Stocks, on the other hand, have  tended to
grow much faster than more conservative investments, and have  provided the
strong returns necessary to outpace inflation (see chart below). </P>
<P>That's why it's important to consider keeping a portion of your assets in 
stocks, even if you're retired, or close to retiring. That way, your portfolio 
has a better chance of retaining its purchasing power throughout your
retirement.  Of course, stock prices typically fluctuate more than those of
conservative  investments in the short-term. But the longer you invest, the more
opportunity  you have to put those fluctuations to work for you in the form of
higher  potential returns. </P>

represented by the Lehman Brothers Long-Term Government Bond index which
includes fixed rate debt issues rated investment grade or higher by Moody's and

<P>It's important to view investing as a process, not a one-time event. Often, 
one of the reasons we don't start investing sooner is because, after paying 
bills and spending money elsewhere, we don't think there's anything left  over.
</P>
<P>One of the most effective ways to overcome this obstacle is to establish  an
<A HREF="/strong/html/contact_open.ht1#aip">Automatic Investment Plan (AIP</A>).
With a Strong AIP, you can transfer dollars once or twice a month from  your
checking account into one or more Strong mutual fund accounts. </P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE="5">You</FONT></I> <B><FONT SIZE="5">&quot;Pay Yourself
First.&quot;</FONT></B> A program of regular investment ensures that you attend

<P>With a Strong AIP, you can make sure you fully fund your IRA each year, 
automatically. <A HREF="/strong/html/orderform.ht1">The Strong IRA application</A>

<P><I><FONT SIZE="2">*Please keep in mind that a program of regular

<P>Saving enough to retire comfortably is hard enough without giving part of 
your hard-earned assets to Uncle Sam. Fortunately, an IRA offers several  ways
to make sure your retirement assets keep growing tax-deferred. </P>
<P><B>&#149; If you retire or <A HREF="lumps.ht1">change jobs</A>, roll over
your entire retirement plan distribution into your IRA.</B> Taking your
distribution in cash leaves you open to a myriad of potential  taxes and
penalties:</P>
<UL>
<LI>20% federal withholding on the entire amount you receive.  
</LI>
<LI>Federal, state and local income tax.  
</LI>
<LI>If you're less than 591/2 years of age, you may have to pay a 10% IRS
penalty  for early withdrawal.  
</LI></UL>
<P>An IRA direct rollover helps you avoid all these potential pitfalls. You 
may establish your IRA with a direct rollover from a qualified retirement  plan
by completing both the <A HREF="/strong/html/orderform.ht1">Strong IRA
application</A> and the <A HREF="/strong/html/orderform.ht1">Strong IRA
transfer form</A>. </P>
<P><B>&#149; Invest as much as you can in your IRA, even if you can't afford
the maximum.</B> You don't have to contribute $2,000 every year to start
building assets  tax-deferred. Even $100 a month can make a big impact over
time. At Strong,  you can open an IRA in many of our funds for as little as
$250. </P>
<P><B>&#149; Fund your existing IRA early in the year.</B> Many people wait to
fund their IRA until late in the year, or early in  the following year to claim
a deduction on their prior year's tax return.  If you tend to contribute the
maximum amount all at one time, try to do  it early in the calendar year. That
way, you put your assets to work that  much sooner. </P>
<HR WIDTH="125">
<P><A NAME="5"><IMG SRC="/strong/images/Retirement/head5.gif"></A></P>
<P>When it comes to investing, diversification-allocating your assets among  a
variety of investments that have different return potentials and risk 
levels--means not putting all your eggs into one investment basket. Because 
market cycles vary, diversification may allow you to offset possible losses  in
one investment type with potential gains in another. As a result, you  may help
increase your portfolio's overall return potential over time. </P>
<P><I><FONT SIZE="5">&quot;Don't put all your</FONT></I> <B><FONT SIZE="5">EGGS</FONT></B>
<I><FONT SIZE="5">in one basket.&quot;</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="3"> IT'S GOOD

take advantage of the benefits of diversification. To illustrate how asset 
allocation can work for you, we've created <A HREF="5pies.ht1">five model

<P>
The best retirement vehicles are those that allow you to shield your assets from current taxes, such as a 
<A HREF=/strong/Retirement/heck.ht1>401(k) plan</A> where you work.<BR>
<BR>
But what if you don't have access to a 401(k) or other retirement plan, or you don't think your current plan will be sufficient to make your retirement dreams a reality? That's where an Individual Retirement Account (an IRA) can help you take control of your retirement planning.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>What is an IRA?</H3>
An IRA is a program constructed specifically to help Americans invest for retirement. Each year, you can invest up to a certain amount in your IRA. Usually, the limit is $2,000 per year per account, but if you're self-employed or own a small business, you may be able to contribute more. While your contribution may or may not be tax-deductible, any gains in your IRA will grow tax-deferred. 
<P>
Because IRAs are meant to be used solely as retirement-savings vehicles, the Internal Revenue Service may impose a 10% penalty on any withdrawals you make before age 59&#189;. Additionally, you are required to begin taking distributions from your account by the time you reach age 70&#189;.  At that time, your distributions will be taxed at your then-current income-tax rate. <BR>
<BR>

<H3>An IRA can help you ...</H3>
<UL>

<LI> <B>Build assets tax-deferred</B>. With a taxable investment, Uncle Sam takes his annual cut off the top, which reduces your earnings. But with an IRA, your savings grow and compound tax-deferred until you withdraw them at retirement. As you can see from the chart at the right, tax-deferred growth can make a huge difference over time.

This chart is for illustrative purposes<BR> only and does not represent the performance of any Strong Fund.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<B>Reduce your taxable income</B>. If you're not an &quot;active participant&quot; in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, your IRA contribution may be tax-deductible. And if you're self-employed or a small-business owner, you may be able to fund your IRA with pre-tax dollars. Not only does your account grow tax-deferred, but every dollar you contribute reduces your tax bill, as well.
<P>
 Even if your contribution isn't tax-deductible, an IRA still allows your investment to grow on a tax-deferred basis -- a big advantage versus a similar taxable investment.<P>

<LI>
<B>Use your retirement dollars effectively</B>. An IRA is a flexible investment that can be used in many different ways. IRAs allow you to start early, invest regularly, adjust your asset allocation, and diversify your retirement portfolio. <BR>

<P>A SEP-IRA enables you to establish a company-funded retirement program for
yourself without the administrative expense, government reporting requirements,
and complexity associated with many other types of retirement plans. It
offers other advantages too: </P>
<P><B>Flexibility. </B>Other than the 15% contribution limit for 1996 (of the first $150,000 of
your compensation), there are no annual contribution requirements. You can
contribute 5% one year, 10% the next, and even skip a year if you want.
Also, because you have until the due date (including extensions) for filing
your federal income tax return to establish or contribute to a SEP-IRA,
you have time to get a clear picture of your business's financial status
first. </P>
<P>If you are self-employed and are age 70 1/2 or older, you can still contribute
to a SEP-IRA even though you can no longer contribute to a regular IRA. </P>
<P><B>Simplicity. </B>Unlike qualified plans, no extra IRA or government reporting is required.
Just fill out the simple Form 5305-SEP and file it with your personal records.
(Form 5305-SEP is included in Strong's SEP-IRA investment kit, which may
be <A HREF="/strong/html/regular.ht1">ordered through regular mail</A> or by calling 1-800-359-3379).  You may then take a deduction on your federal
income tax return for your SEP-IRA contribution. </P>

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="_wmh3_829605405">Who Should Consider a SEP-IRA? </A></H3>
<P>If you are self-employed and earn income, you can establish a SEP-IRA. If
you want to contribute up to 15% of your pre-tax income to a retirement
plan, a SEP-IRA may be especially useful. Consider a SEP-IRA if you: </P>

If neither you nor your spouse is an &quot;active participant&quot; in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, you both may deduct your<I> entire contribution</I>, up to, of course, your applicable limit. The W-2 Form you receive each year from your employer should indicate whether or not you're considered an active participant. Check with your employer, though, if you're unclear about your status.
<P>
However, if either of you participates in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, you may deduct your contribution only if your adjusted gross income falls within certain ranges, shown below.

There is a $200 minimum floor on the deduction limit if your adjusted gross income does not exceed $35,000 (for a single taxpayer), $50,000 (for married taxpayers filing jointly), and $10,000 (for a married taxpayer filing separately).  For married couples filing a joint return, the deduction limitations on IRA contributions, as determined above, apply to each spouse.

<P>
Your financial or tax advisor can help you determine how much, if any, of your IRA contribution is deductible. But remember, even if your contribution isn't tax-deductible, your gains still compound tax-deferred until you withdraw them at retirement, when they'll be taxed at your then-current rate.<P>

      Employment-Income IRA (Regular IRA)

    <P>
    <STRONG><I>Investor Profile</I></STRONG>: You have employment income, and
    you won't turn age 70&#189; until after December 31 of this year. <BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>IRA Type</I></STRONG>: You can open a regular IRA for the current

    1997</B>, you may contribute no more than $2,250 of earned income between
    both IRAs (yours and your spouse's), with a maximum of $2,000 in one account.
    For example, you could invest $1,000 in your IRA and $1,250 in your spouse's.
    <B>After January 1, 1997</B>, the annual contribution limit is $4,000, with

    may have made -- from your former employer's plan directly into a Strong
    IRA.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Rollover Contribution Limit</I></STRONG>: Unlimited.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Deductibility</I></STRONG>: While a rollover IRA isn't deductible,
    your assets aren't taxed, so your nest egg will remain intact and continue
    to grow tax-deferred.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Note</I></STRONG>: A <I>direct</I> rollover helps you avoid the
    20% withholding that the government assesses on distributions that are eligible
    to be rolled over into an IRA but are instead received in cash or check form.

    <STRONG><I>Deductibility</I></STRONG>: Fully deductible.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Note</I></STRONG>: Aside from its higher contribution allowance
    and deductibility, a SEP-IRA is generally subject to the same rules as a
    regular IRA. Also, note that establishing a SEP doesn't preclude you or your
    employees from owning individual IRAs, as well.<BR>

    <H3>
      Salary Reduction SEP-IRA (SARSEP-IRA)

    <P>
    <STRONG><I>Investor Profile</I></STRONG>: You own a business employing 25
    or fewer people.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>IRA Type</I></STRONG>: You can set up a SARSEP-IRA, which allows
    your employees to make IRA contributions directly out of their salaries.
    This can be in addition to those provided by the employer through a SEP-IRA
    -- and in addition to their individual IRAs.<BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Annual Contribution Limit</I></STRONG>: Salary deferral of $9,500
    (for 1996), adjusted annually. In addition, if an employer makes contributions
    into a SEP-IRA, the combination of the two plans cannot be more than 15%
    of an employee's annual compensation or more than $22,500, whichever is less.
    At least 50% of employees must participate in the plan. <BR>
    <BR>
    <STRONG><I>Deductibility</I></STRONG>: Contributions are deducted directly
    from compensation and are therefore not taxed until withdrawal. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B><STRONG><I>Please Note</I></STRONG>: Effective December 31, 1996</B>,
    employers will no longer be able to establish a SARSEP-IRA. Those employers
    who have established a plan by this deadline will be able to maintain their
    existing accounts. A new simplified retirement plan for small businesses
    called the Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) is effective
    for years beginning after December 31, 1996. For any additional questions,
    please contact a Strong Retirement Plans Specialist at 1-800-368-3001 from
    8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Time.<BR>

<H3>OUTSOURCING</H3><p><DD><DD>The
 firm's technology
 department is a recognized leader in the structuring and implementation of technology
 outsourcing transactions for substantial institutional clients.  Four of
 our partners and many associates have experience advising clients on various aspects
 of outsourcing transactions, including reviewing proposed transactions and
 advising clients on the advantages and disadvantages of such transactions, and
 drafting and negotiating information
 technology outsourcing agreements, both from user and vendor standpoints.
  Historically, such transactions have ranged from &quot;full&quot; IT outsourcings
 of the &quot;Glass House&quot;, telecommunications and applications development,
 including transitioning of hundreds of employees, to &quot;selective&quot;
 outsourcings of certain technology-related functions such as applications
 development, client/server functions, and legacy systems maintenance.<br><DD><DD>Last
 year we closed a landmark
 deal representing a major bank in outsourcing most of its telecommunications
 resources.  This transaction involved the outsourcing of voice and data-related
 operations, billing, technology planning, and messaging, and involved the
 transfer of numerous employees, along with the transfer of ownership of equipment
 such as PBX's and voice and data networks.  It required across-the-board legal
 expertise not only in computers, technology and intellectual property law,
 but also in areas such as employment
 and tax law. <P>

Intelligent Buildings Increase Productivity and Save Costs</h2>
<p>
Some Tips to Avoid Problems<p>
<p>
	Recent studies have recognized that intelligently designed and operated
buildings yield dramatic increases in worker productivity and energy cost
savings.  In one study involving an insurance company headquarters in Wisconsin
utilizing an energy efficient lighting system, better windows, superior
insulation and a more efficient heating, ventilating and air-condition system,
a 40-percent reduction in energy consumption and a 16-percent increase in
claim-processing productivity was found.  Other studies have documented similar
cost saving and productivity gains.<p>
<p>
	State-of-the-art technology is utilized in intelligent buildings to provide
fresh air, natural light, improved acoustics, flexible work space, and
computerized controls designed to allow individual workers and tenants to
regulate their local environments.  As a result, technology has been
transformed from that which "lives" in the workplace to that which controls and
manages the workplace.<p>
<p>
	The demand for the intelligent building has come from a number of sources.
For one, modernization of the workplace has raised concerns over the health of
corporate employees.  Office machines, including computers, printers,
photocopiers and fax machines have increased indoor pollution.  The electrical
and telecommunications facilities found in most office buildings also have
failed to keep up with the demands created by the rapid growth of computer
technology.<p>
<p>
	New technology is also used to create intelligent buildings.  Databases, which
include organizational structure, headcount, physical space required to perform
and other facilities are developed and maintained.  This allows planners to
track assets and facilities, and calculate overhead cost.  These can be
integrated with Computer Assisted Design (CAD) devices to depict usage of the
facility's assets, and with the use of other facilities management systems,
lead to optimize investment in the facility and its assets.  Computerized
facility management appears to be the key to managing communications,
environment, productivity and work flow, in order to maintain intelligent
buildings.  In designing a workable structure, the problem to be addressed is
that a building will have a "life cycle" of approximately forty years, but
office automation technology changes every 1-3 years, telecommunications every
3-5 years and building management every 5-7 years.  One goal of the
intelligentbuilding is to maximize the useful life of these investments over
the building's life span.<p>
<p>
	Cost savings in equipment purchases (through integrated wiring systems),
construction costs (through the integration of cable and delivery methods), and
administrative savings are also benefits of intelligent buildings.
Additionally, intelligent buildings provide a competitive advantage, measured
in intangibles such as tenant satisfaction and improvements in imployee
health.<p>
<p>
	Intelligent buildings will be the standard for the next century.  Developers
should now plan for them and tenants should demand them.<p>

Lender Liability Still Alive</h2>
<p>
Some Tips to Avoid Problems<p>
<p>
	Now that the real estate depression of the early 1990s--and the litigation it
engendered--appears to be ending, it is instructive to examine how the defense
of "lender liability" fared.  The short answer is: not well, but still
breathing.<p>
<p>
	The theories of lender liability raised by borrowers and guarantors have
included lenders' alleged bad faith in refusing to advance or to continue to
advance funds, lenders' purported improper control over the borrower, fraud,
negligent misrepresentation, waiver, equitable estoppel, breach of fiduciary
duty and/or breach of contract, failure of consideration, economic duress,
conversion, mutual mistake, intentional infliction of emotional distress and
prima facie tort.  Generally speaking, barring convincing proof sufficient to
overcome language in the loan documents expressly designed to preclude the
assertion of such claims, the courts have dismissed these various lender
liability theories.  Where, however, borrowers have been able to support
allegations of wrongful conduct, courts have permitted them to prove their
defenses on trial.<p>
<p>
	In a number of cases, the borrowers' allegations of bad faith, negligence,
fraud and misrepresentation have been rejected for a number of reasons.  For
example, in Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. v. Bank of Montreal, 1995 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 1969 (S.D.N.Y. February 16, 1995), the Court held that the withdrawal of
a commitment letter after the bank's receipt of the borrower's lower than
expected financial projections did not constitute bad faith, negligence,
negligent misrepresentation or fraud, and in Walther v. Bank of New York, 772
F.Supp. 754 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) the Court rejected the guarantor's allegation that
the bank did not act in good faith by applying the proceeds from the sale of
collateral securing the guarantor's loan to another loan, not guaranteed by
him.<p>
<p>
	Courts have also held that a mortgagee has no duty to accept less than the
full amount of its debt.  For example, in The Dime Sav. Bank of New York, FSB
v. Johneas, 172 A.D.2d 1082, 1083-84, 569 N.Y.S.2d 260, 262 (4th Dep't 1991)
the bank was not required to give the borrower any notice before taking action
to protect its rights.  The Court also held that the lender properly refused to
accept the borrower's late and insufficient tender of payment.<p>
<p>
	In other foreclosure actions, courts have also rejected borrowers' waiver,
modification and estoppel arguments.  In Howard Savings Bank v. Lefcon
Partnership, 209 A.D.2d 473, 618 N.Y.S.2d 910 (2d Dep't 1994) the Court found
that the bank's decision not to declare the borrower in default on earlier
occasions did not constitute a waiver or modification of the agreement where
the agreement did not require the bank to exercise any particular option in the
event of default).<p>
<p>
	Notwithstanding these cases, there still remains the possibility that
borrowers will prevail on lender liability theories.  For example in Whitney v.
Citibank, N.A., 782 F.2d 1106 (2d Cir. 1986), the Second Circuit affirmed an
award of $236,677 in compensatory damages and $1.5 million in punitive damages
where a lender was found to have induced a breach of fiduciary duty by two of
three general partners.<p>
<p>
	In other cases, courts have refused to dismiss borrowers' claims or have
denied lenders summary judgment finding triable issues of fact as to their
alleged wrongful conduct.  In Scott v. The Dime Savings Bank of New York, FSB,
886 F.Supp. 1073 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) the Court refused to dismiss as a matter of
law, after a jury trial, the borrower's claims of breach of fiduciary duty and
negligence where the jury could have reasonably found that the borrowers'
relationship with the lender went well beyond the usual debtor-creditor
relationship, and that the borrowers reposed their trust and confidence in the
lender so that the lender gained a resulting superiority or influence over the
borrowers.<p>
<p>
	As is apparent from the above cases, various theories of lender liability have
continued to be actively litigated during the past several years.  While many
of these cases have reached results favorable to lenders, such cases tended to
involve undisputed facts and unsupported allegations by borrowers which were
generally held to be insufficient to withstand even summary judgment.  Where,
however, more unusual fact patterns were involved and borrowers were able to
adequately support their allegations with affidavits and other documentation,
and such allegations were not met with equal or adequate proof by lenders,
courts have not hesitated to impose liability on lenders or, at a minimum, to
deny summary judgment and allow parties to engage in discovery.<p>

Return of the Sick Building Syndrome</h2>
<p>
Some Tips to Avoid Problems<p>
<p>
As a result of three well publicized jury verdicts, attention has been
refocused on the sick building "syndrome."  This phenomenon causes workers to
become ill with a variety of physical and psychological symptoms allegedly due
to environmental conditions present in their buildings.<p>
<p>
	The cause of the sick building syndrome ("SBS"), and even its very existence,
has been the subject of much debate for several years.  Arguments continue as
to whether SBS is a product of faulty design or construction, poor maintenance
practices, or a tenant's improper use of its space.  However, it is now
generally accepted that certain deleterious conditions may exist in buildings
which cause illnesses and result in a marked lack of employee productivity.<p>
<p>
	The first of the three cases came in December, 1993, in Bahura v. S.E.W.
Investors, Inc. (D.C. Superior Court), where five employees of EPA were awarded
a total of $950,000 for ailments they claimed were related to indoor air
quality.  The plaintiffs alleged a range of health problems supposedly due to
renovations made to the building, and south damages from the building's owners
and managers.  After a two-month trial, the jury found that while four of the
five plaintiffs suffered no physical injury, they suffered compensable
psychological disorders called "somatization", that is, physical symptoms where
were psychologically based.  (Subsequently, the trial judge overturned the jury
award based on somatization but let stand the award for actual physical
injury.)<p>
<p>
	In the second case, County of DuPage v. Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum
(Illinois Circuit Court), the plaintiff, the owner of the county courthouse,
did not fare as well, and was itself found to be responsible for contributing
to the building's problems.  In DuPage, the 700 employees of the building were
evacuated in September, 1992 after many workers became ill with respiratory
problems, headaches and eye irritation.  Thereafter, about $4,000,000 was spent
to fix the ventilation and air conditioning system, and the building was
reoccupied in March, 1993.<p>
<p>
	The county sought more than $6,000,000 in damages to cover all of its costs,
including relocating employees.  Despite the assertions by the county that the
conditions were caused by faulty design and construction, the jury found the
county responsible, based upon steps it took in an effort to resolve theair
quality complaints of its employees.  These efforts included the use of
chemicals to clean furnishings and the performance of alterations to the
mechanical systems.  The jury granted only minor damages against the architect
and contractor as a result of flaws in the air handling systems.<p>
<p>
	In the last case, Polk County v. Reliance Insurance Co. (Florida Circuit
Court), the county was awarded $25.9 million against the insurance company of
its courthouse contractor.  The county claimed that defects in the design and
construction of the building caused the heating, ventilating and air
conditioning system to become contaminated, resulting in serious health effects
for about 80% of the building's 580 employees.  The jury agreed, finding that
the damages began while the building was under construction from 1984 to 1987,
when the insurance policy was in effect.  Polk County spent about $40,000,000
for repairs, relocation of employees, workers' compensation and legal costs.
At trial, experts blamed the high rate of illnesses among the employees to a
faulty ventilation and air conditioning system.<p>
<p>
	Although these decisions have had mixed results, it would appear that more
litigation in this area will be seen as more attorneys take note of this
relatively new theory of liability.  Building owners would be well advised to
embark upon proactive operations and maintenance programs designed to prevent
SBS.  Tenant-employers should inquire of their landlords whether such programs
are in effect.  If faced with complaints or litigation, both owners and
employers must aggressively investigate the claims asserted and retain their
own experts to analyze the claimant's allegations and grounds of causation.<p>

Title Insurers Immune From Negligence Liability</h2>
<p>
Some Tips to Avoid Problems<p>
<p>
	In a negative decision for lenders, the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of New York has provided a new area of protection for title insurers from
negligence liability in Citibank V. Chicago Title Ins. Co., 1995 N.Y. App. Div.
LEXIS 9623 (September 28, 1995).  Hereafter, New York mortgagees no longer can
recover their losses due to erroneous title searches in actions for negligence
or breach of contract under title insurance policies, unless a "guaranteed
search" was performed.<p>
<p>
	In this case, Citibank refinanced an existing mortgage from Thomas Duke, held
by Citytrust, and obtained two additional mortgages on the same property.
Before agreeing to the refinancing, Citibank required mortgage title insurance
from Chicago Title Insurance Company.  Chicago Title's abstractor conducted a
title search and subsequently prepared the report of closing included in
Chicago Title's Commitment for Title Insurance.  Chicago Title did not,
however, guarantee the search.<p>
<p>
	The report of closing listed nine exceptions which Chicago Title would not
insure.  The report failed, however, to list four liens, including a mortgage
from Thomas Duke, a judgment lien against the real property mortgaged by Duke,
a lis pendens disclosing that the Citytrust mortgage was in foreclosure, and a
foreclosure action on another mortgage loan.  After Citibank spent years
litigating with other lienholders to settle priority disputes, it finally
foreclosed on the mortgage.<p>
<p>
	As the successful bidder at the foreclosure auction, Citibank took title free
and clear of the four title defects.  The property's market value was, however,
substantially lower than the amount of its lien and Citibank obtained a
deficiency judgment.<p>
<p>
	Citibank sought damages from Chicago Title Insurance Company on the theories
of breach of contract and negligence, claiming that it relied on the report of
title to decide whether or not to proceed with the transaction.  Citibank
claimed that if it had an accurate picture of Duke's financial circumstances,
it would not have agreed to make the loan.<p>
<p>
	The Appellate Division reversed the summary judgment awarded to Citibank by
the lower court.  Applying New York case law, the Appellate Division stated
that a cause of action for negligence in searching title cannot lie on the
insurance policy because thecontract of insurance and the contract of searching
are distinct and separate.  Under the contract for searching titles, the title
insurance company may be held liable for negligence.  In contrast, in an action
brought under the contract of title insurance, the carrier only agrees to
indemnify the insured if title turns out to be defective.<p>
<p>
	The Appellate Division further discussed the inconsistency between Citibank's
claim that it relied on Chicago title's representation in the title report and
the purpose of obtaining title insurance to protect against losses from
undisclosed title defects.  The court stated that insurance is issued to
protect against the risk's occurrence, not as a guarantee that it will not
occur.<p>
<p>
	Although the court recognized that lenders and buyers customarily rely on
title searches performed by title insurers, the search in the instant case was
made solely for Citibank's benefit.  The purpose of the title search was only
to define the scope of coverage and thus, the search did not constitute an
independent representation of title giving Citibank a cause of action in
negligence or misrepresentation.<p>
<p>
	Finally, the court applied insurance law to differentiate between title
insurance policies and guaranteed searches.  Since this case rested on a title
insurance policy only and not a guaranteed search, the title insurer was
obligated solely to indemnify the insured for the loss in value resulting from
title defects insured under the policy.<p>

Construction Lending Returns</h2>
<p>
Some Tips to Avoid Problems<p>
<p>
	Putting the painful experience of commercial construction lending of the late
1980s behind them, lenders are cautiously resuming the origination of
construction loans, primarily in the area of affordable housing.  The
motivation for lenders is not only the Community Reinvestment Act, but the
realization that a well underwritten and administered construction loan of this
type makes sound business sense.<p>
<p>
	In order to avoid the problems of the past, it may be helpful to revisit some
of the fundamental principles of construction lending.  By adhering to these
principles, both borrower and lender can achieve their joint goal--successful
completion of the project on time and on budget.  They will also achieve their
underlying objective of protecting and preserving the collateral, i.e., the
building, in order to facilitate either a sale as a cooperative or take out
under a permanent loan.<p>
<b><p>
Avoiding Lender Liability<p>
<p>
	</b>From a lender's perspective the key principle in avoiding lender liability
is the maintenance of an independent relationship, which will serve as the best
defense to claims of "joint venture" or "interference with the project" should
difficulties arise.  This principle is especially important in the area of
affordable housing, where there is a tendency to merge or overlap the roles of
the lender, borrower, contractor, and, in certain instances, supervising
governmental agency.<p>
<p>
	It is, therefore, particularly important to maintain the borrower's
independence; the lender must not interfere with, dominate or control decisions
relating to the project, which are customarily within the province of the
borrower.  Nor should the lender deal with contractors directly so as to create
an implied contractual relationship, such that the contractor may be found to
have a direct right of action against the lender.<p>
<p>
	As an underwriting matter, inasmuch as the lender has an equivalent interest
with the borrower in the successful completion of the project, its early
involvement in the process includes a preliminary review of architectural
drawings and the construction budget.  Only after the lender is satisfied that
the project can be built as planned and for the costs allotted, should the loan
be made.  Once its underwriting standards aremet, the real job of the lender
begins, for it is at that time--the administration of the construction
project--that the  greatest challenge arises.<p>
<b><p>
Administration Of The Loan</b><p>
<p>
	A typical building loan agreement clearly defines the roles of the parties
during the construction process and provides a helpful road map to the
successful completion of the project.  Under the BLA, a supervising or
consulting engineer is installed as the lender's representative for the purpose
of insuring compliance with construction documents and the proper disbursement
of loan proceeds.  This individual must be proactive and totally immerse him or
herself in all phases of the project--from initial plan review to final
disbursement--in order to afford the lender the highest level of protection.
Frequent inspections of the project, attendance at job meetings and informal
discussions with subcontractors regarding the status of work and payments, are
but a few of the protections a consulting engineer can provide the lender.<p>
<b><p>
Protective Provisions Of The BLA</b><p>
<p>
	Other than the installment of the consulting engineer, the BLA sets forth
several obligations on the part of the borrower in order to facilitate
successful completion.  These obligations should be scrupulously enforced.
Among them are the following:<p>
<p>
	?The borrower must complete construction in strict accordance with the
construction contract and all plans and specifications.<p>
<p>
	?The project must be completed free and clear of all liens of contractors and
subcontractors and in compliance with all pertinent laws.<p>
<p>
	?There may be no modification, assignment or subcontracting of the work
without the lender's written approval.<p>
<p>
	?The consulting engineer must have complete access to the project at all
times.<p>
<p>
	?The consulting engineer must be furnished with details of the construction,
such as catalog excerpts and shop drawings.<p>
<p>
	?The borrower's financial records, particularly proof of payment to
contractors, must be available for inspection by the lender at all times.<p>
<p>
	?At the completion of the project, a final certificate of occupancy must be
provided to the lender.<p>
<b><p>
Avoidance Of Liens</b><p>
<p>
	In order for a building loan mortgage to maintain its priority as a first lien
against the realty, certain fundamental principles must be followed.
Essentially, the BLA must contain a contractual provision that the borrower
will hold all loan advances and the right to receive such advances as a trust
fund to be applied first for the purpose of paying the cost of the improvement,
and it will use all proceeds for this purpose before disbursing the funds for
any other purpose.<p>
<p>
	Additionally, the BLA must contain a so-called law affidavit setting forth the
funds which will be available for the cost of the improvement.  Prior to each
advance, a title report will be issued to determine that no liens have been
filed against the project.<p>
<p>
	In addition to formal compliance with the lien law and construction lending
practices, other procedures should be established prior to any disbursement.
For example, lien waivers from the general contractor and major subcontractors
should be obtained and each request for payment must be carefully reviewed by
the consulting engineer to determine that it properly reflects the percentage
of work completed.  The consulting engineer should also determine that the
construction costs listed were actually incurred; whether the funds remaining
in the loan are adequate to complete construction; and whether construction is
proceeding on time.  At the request of the consulting engineer, the borrower
should be able to provide evidence of payment to its subcontractors.<p>
<p>
		Even though the provisions discussed above give the lender broad latitude in
monitoring the construction process and approving the disbursement of funds, it
should be remembered that the successful completion of a project is a
cooperative effort requiring open communication and a willingness to resolve
disputes quickly and fairly.  With these principles borne in mind, and armed
with a working knowledge of the building loan agreement, a lender can reduce
the potential for problems and increase the likelihood that the project will be
completed on time, within budget and without contractor claims.<p>

City Adopts Smoke-Free Air Act</h2>
<p>
Some Tips to Avoid Problems<p>
<p>
	Earlier this year, the City of New York adopted the Smoke-Free Air Act
imposing severe restrictions on smoking in public places.  As regards office
buildings and other places of employment, while smoking is generally
prohibited, an employer may provide a single, separate smoking room on each
floor, provided the room does not exceed a certain size and is not used for any
other purpose, such as an employee lounge or equipment area.<p>
<p>
	Additionally, the smoking room must be clearly designated as such; comply with
fire code requirements; have a separate ventilation system with an outside
exhaust; and be negatively pressurized to prevent second hand smoke entering
smoke free areas.<p>
<p>
	Smoking may be permitted in any private enclosed office occupied by three or
fewer individuals provided, however, that smoking is permitted only if at least
one of the persons present is the usual occupant, and when each person present
consents to smoking.  Further, the door to such office must be closed
completely in order to eliminate drift of secondhand smoke into smoke-free
areas.<p>
<p>
	By November 1, 1995, every employer must adopt a written smoking policy
prohibiting smoking except in smoking rooms and qualified private offices;
establishing a procedure to resolve disputes arising under the smoking policy;
and protecting complaining employees from retaliatory actions should they
attempt to exercise their rights under the law.  Employers are also required to
post the smoking policy, supply a written copy of the policy to any employee,
and provide a copy of the policy to various City agencies.  Further, employers
will be required to post smoking and no smoking signs where smoking is either
prohibited or permitted.<p>
<p>
	Employers must also designate an agent who shall be responsible for informing
individuals smoking in restricted areas that they are in violation of the Act.
The Act establishes a schedule of fines ranging from $100 for a first violation
to $1,000 for a third or subsequent violation within a period of twelve
months.<p>
<p>
	A key provision in the Act permits owners of buildings to completely prohibit
smoking.  This would seem to be designed to allow an owner to avoid the
requirements of constructing smoking rooms, which tenants may insist is the
owner's responsibility under so called "compliance with law" lease provisions.
It is not certain, however, that this provision will eliminate contentions by
tenants that owners are responsible to construct separate smoking rooms.
Owners will, no doubt, counter that the tenant could avoid the requirement of
the law to construct a smoking room by simply prohibiting smoking in its
office.<p>

OSHA To Require Asbestos Notification</h2>
<p>
Some Tips to Avoid Problems<p>
<p>
	Effective July 10, 1995, building owners must maintain and communicate
knowledge of the location of asbestos containing materials (ACM) or presumed
asbestos containing materials (PACM) to any of their employees as well as to
contractors or subcontractors whose employees could be exposed to the
materials.<p>
<p>
	The following is a summary of the requirements of the rule, as prepared by the
Real Estate Board of New York in a bulletin to its members.<p>
<p>
	OSHA requires owners and employers to presume that all thermal system
insulation and sprayed on and troweled on surfacing materials contain asbestos,
unless rebutted pursuant to the standard (i.e. unless the material has been
tested or construction documents are available).  Employers must also presume
that resilient flooring installed before 1980 contains asbestos.<p>
<p>
	Before initiating asbestos removal or repair and maintenance work where
asbestos may be disturbed, building and/or project owners must notify their
employees and employers who are bidding on such work of the quantity and
location of ACM and PACM present in such areas.  Owners must also notify
employees who work in or adjacent to such jobs.<p>
<p>
	Contractors or subcontractors planning any covered activity must notify the
owner of the location and quantity of ACM and PACM known or later discovered.
The building owner must keep records of all information received through this
notification scheme, or through other means which relate to the presence,
location and quantity of ACM and PACM at the owner's building and transfer all
such information to successive owners.<p>
<b><p>
Signage and labeling</b><p>
<p>
	At the entrance to mechanical rooms containing ACM or PACM, signs shall be
posted identifying the material, its location, and appropriate work practices.
Work areas where asbestos removal or repair or maintenance activities take
place which may disturb asbestos must be posted with warning signs.  Materials
identified as ACM and PACM must be labeled.  However, the signs required at the
entrance to mechanical spaces may be posted in lieu of labeling.<p>
<b><p>
Training</b><p>
<p>
	Employees performing maintenance and custodial activities during which they
are in contact with ACM or PACM must receive asbestos awareness training of at
least two hours.  The course must be equivalent to EPA's prescribed training.<p>
<b><p>
Record Keeping<p>
</b><p>
	The employer must maintain all employee training records for one year beyond
the last date of employment by that employer.  Where the building owner and
employer have relied on data to demonstrate that PACM is not asbestos
containing, such data shall be maintained for as long as needed to rebut the
presumption.<p>
<p>
	Where the building owner has communicated and received information concerning
the identity, location and quantity of ACM and PACM, written records of such
notification and their content shall be maintained by the owner for the
duration of ownership and shall be transferred to successive owners.<p>

OSHA Proposes Sweeping Indoor Air Quality Rule</h2>
<p>

	In an extraordinary exercise of rulemaking OSHA has proposed a sweeping
regulation designed to improve the indoor air quality for 70 million
non-industrial environments, including offices, schools, commercial
establishments and health care facilities.  The proposed rule carries an annual
price tag of over $8 billion.<p>
<p>
	OSHA's initiative follows several years of petitioning and litigation by
public interest groups.  At first, OSHA determined that the available data with
respect to exposure to indoor contaminants was insufficient to demonstrate the
existence of a danger within the meaning of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act.  However, following extensive submissions of documentation by interested
individuals, groups and industries, OSHA concluded that the data submitted
supported the finding that air contaminants and other air quality factors could
act to present significant health risks to employees working in indoor
environments, such as sensory irritation, respiratory allergies, Legionnaires'
disease and signs and symptoms characteristic of exposure to chemical and
biologic substances.  As a result, OSHA now proposes the strict regulation of
building systems in order to address and alleviate indoor air quality
problems.<p>
<p>
	The proposed rule imposes a series of compliance obligations on "employers",
defined not only as traditional employers (i.e., persons engaged in a business
affecting commerce who have employees), but building owners or lessees "who
control the ventilation or maintenance of premises where employees of other
employers work".  In expanding its definition of "employer", OSHA derives its
authority from cases holding that it has enforcement powers over multi-employer
work sites, and which permit OSHA to cite employers for endangering the safety
or health of employees of another employer.<p>
<p>
	In a commercial building context, OSHA, armed with this expansive definition,
may then seek to hold a building owner responsible for the health or safety of
its tenants' employees, even though OSHA acknowledges that there may be joint
responsibility for compliance with the proposed rule.  Unfortunately, the
proposed rule makes no distinction as to the respective responsibilities of
landlords and tenants, and merely imposes the indoor air quality compliance
requirements on "employers".<p>
<p>
	There are five key elements to the proposed rule:<p>
<p>
	1.	<i>The IAQ Compliance Program</i>.  This aspect of the proposed rule will
require a detailed narrative and schematic description of the HVAC, water
energy management and other building systems which impact indoor air quality.
Included within the narrative will be operating procedures, performance
criteria, maintenance programs and inspection procedures.<p>
<p>
	2.	<i>Compliance Program Implementation</i>.  A series of specific steps for
implementation are set out in the proposed rule.  Among these steps are the
maintenance and operation of the HVAC system to meet design specifications and
governmental and industry codes; periodic inspections of the system; the
operation of the system during all work shifts; the monitoring of contaminants;
the maintenance of natural ventilation; the abatement of asbestos so as to
prevent entry into the air distribution system; and the establishment of
written records of inspections and maintenance.<p>
<p>
	3.	<i>Controls for Specific Contaminants</i>.  The much heralded controls for
tobacco smoke require the establishment of designated smoking areas where
smoking is not otherwise prohibited; the assurance that the smoking areas are
enclosed and exhausted directly to the outside; the cleaning of the areas only
when no smoking is taking place; the posting of signs clearly indicating areas
that are designated smoking areas as well as signs stating that smoking is
restricted; and the prohibition of smoking during any time when exhaust systems
are not operating.<p>
<p>
	Other indoor contaminants are to be regulated by the relocation of intakes;
the implementation of additional exhaust ventilation; the control of potential
sources of contamination; the restriction on the use of chemicals, pesticides
and other hazardous materials; and the establishment of procedures to maintain
acceptable indoor air quality during renovation and remodeling.<p>
<p>
	4.	<i>Employee Information and Training</i>.  Employers are required to
provide training for maintenance workers involved in building system operation
maintenance programs.<p>
<p>
	5.	<i>Record Keeping</i>.  Employers will be required to maintain inspection
and maintenance records which will include the specific remedial or maintenance
actions taken in response to reported air quality problems.<p>
<p>
	OSHA considered a number of factors in estimating the annual $8 billion cost
of the proposed rule; HVAC systems may have to be retrofitted when design
occupancy levels are exceeded; extensive building wide information must be
compiled; existing systems must be evaluated; improvements and alterations such
as the relocation of exhaust systems and ventilation systems may be required;
training programs for all workers must be implemented; and designated smoking
areas may have to be created which will be accompanied by separate exhaust
systems.<p>
<p>
	The proposed rule is now in the comment and public hearing phase, with a final
rule not expected for at least one year.<p>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">
New Form of Real Estate Ownership Available</h2>
<p>

	Under the terms of new legislation becoming effective this October, real
estate owners can now obtain the liability protection of a corporation and the
tax advantages of a partnership in a form of ownership known as "Limited
Liability Corporation".  It will no longer be necessary either to form
Subchapter S corporations or limited partnerships with corporate general
partners in order to obtain these liability and tax advantages.<p>
<p>
	Under the new law, a single limited liability corporation, consisting of
"members" rather than "partners", and a "managing member" rather than an
"general Partner", can conduct business under an operating agreement which is
similar to a partnership agreement.  From a tax point of view, the LLC will be
subject to partnership tax provisions and profits, losses and distributions can
be based on percentage of ownership.  From a liability standpoint, the LLC will
have the same protection as a corporation, and the personal assets of the
members will be beyond the reach of the creditors of the LLC.
Administratively, the LLC structure avoids having to set up an additional
general corporate partner; there will be only one entity per building and only
one tax return need be filed.<p>
<p>
	The LLC will also be beneficial for estate planning purposes of the real
estate owner.  If the managing partner wants to transfer ownership to children,
memberships can be transferred while the managing membership interest is
retained.  LLCs will also promote the participation of foreign investors, who
can now be members (whereas such investors could not be members of Subchapter S
corporations).<p>
<p>
	The creation of an LLC or the conversion of an existing partnership into an
LLC is relatively simple.  The LLC is formed by filing articles of organization
with the New York Department of State and a copy of the articles or a notice
containing the substance of the articles must be published once a week for six
successive weeks in two newspapers.  There is a one time filing fee of $200.
Annual fees to the State and City each amount to a $325 minimum tax or $50 per
member.  Unfortunately, the conversion of an existing corporation to an LLC is
far more complex.  Inasmuch as an LLC, for purposes of taxation is the same as
a partnership, the corporation would need to liquidate and the assets must be
passed to the owners before they are put into the LLC.<p>
<p>
	In the case of a simple conversion from a partnership to an LLC, no transfer
tax will be paid (similar exempt transfers are now permitted by reason of newly
enacted tax laws, where property is transferred into a real estate investment
trust).<p>
<p>
	As a result of the multiple advantages to the use of LLCs, real estate owners
should consider this new form of entity both when creating new ventures and
evaluating the structures of existing corporations and partnerships<p>

Tenant Found Liable For Asbestos Abatement</h2>
<p>

	A tenant has been found liable for the cost of abating asbestos where the
abatement was required solely to facilitate a subletting of the premises.
Applying New York law, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit ruled in CPT <i>Corp. v. Daewoo International Corp.</i> (20 F.3d 882)
that inasmuch as the premises could be used in the manner intended, even
without the asbestos abatement, the tenant would bear the cost of the
abatement.<p>
<p>
	CPT had subleased two floors of Manhattan office space from Daewoo in 1983 for
a ten year term.  In 1986, faced with declining sales, CPT sought to sublet the
premises and relocate to smaller quarters.  However, it found that most
potential tenants lost interest in the sublet once they learned that remodeling
the offices would trigger costly asbestos abatement.  CPT demanded that Daewoo
bear these costs; however, Daewoo refused.<p>
<p>
	CPT eventually sublet its space on a "as is" basis without substantial
renovation that would trigger asbestos abatement.  CPT ultimately vacated the
entire premises and, as a result of the filing of a petition for relief under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, gave notice of its intent to
reject the sublease.  Daewoo subsequently filed its proof of claim against CPT
for damages based upon the rejection.  Thereafter, CPT filed a complaint
commencing an adversary proceeding seeking the disallowance of Daewoo's claim
and damages from Daewoo for its refusal to take responsibility for asbestos
abatement.<p>
<p>
	The Bankruptcy Court granted CPT summary judgment,k finding Daewoo responsible
for asbestos abatement and offset those damages against rent found due to
Daewoo from CPT.  The District Court affirmed the award of damages for
rejection of the lease against CPT, but reversed the award of damages against
Daewoo.  the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the District Court.<p>
<p>
	In affirming the reversal of the District Court, the Eighth Circuit found that
Daewoo, in the position of a landlord, must comply with ordinances affecting
the general use of the premises; however, if compliance is required because of
the tenant's specific use, the tenant is required to comply with those laws.
In this case, the tenant was responsible because asbestos abatement was
required only due to CPT's intent to sublet the premises; the premises could
have been used in their "as is"condition either by CPT or a new subtenant who
did not seek to renovate the premises.<p>
<p>
	In ruling in this matter, the Eighth Circuit, relying on recent New York
cases, established the principle that a landlord is responsible for asbestos
abatement only when the premises cannot safely be used by any tenant for any
purpose until removal is completed.  If the premises could be used without
asbestos abatement, the tenant would be responsible for the abatement.<p>

Insurance Coverage for Lead Liability Not Barred by the Pollution
Exclusion</h2>
<p>

	In a welcome, but perhaps short lived victory for real estate owners, a lower
New York Court has held that the so-called pollution exclusion in insurance
policies does not bar a claim for lead paint related injuries.  Arguing that
lead is a pollutant, insurance companies have attempted to avoid coverage by
arguing that the pollution exclusion barred lead related claims.  This argument
was, however, rejected in a recent New York decision which held that the
definition of "pollutant" in the policy at issue made no reference to lead,
paint, or lead based paint.  Hence, the claims relating to lead were not
excluded.<p>
<p>
	In another case involving a suit against the owner of a building by a
demolition worker who had been exposed to lead based fumes, the court held that
the pollution exclusion clause did not bar claims arising from lead exposure.
In yet another case, the court held that the reach of the exclusion extends
only to environmental pollution occasioned by intentional discharge of a
pollutant in the course of manufacturing for distribution activities and did
not embrace the harm inflicted by a product which had been "launched into the
stream of commerce".<p>
<p>
	In view of the potential liability arising from injuries caused by lead, a
number of insurance companies have sought to add specific lead exclusions to
their policies.  Recently several commercial liability insurance companies
selling property and casualty insurance in New York have filed for and have
been granted approval to add a lead liability exclusion to insurance policies
they sell in New York.  If such an exclusion is included, coverage would be
barred.<p>
<p>
	In one Maryland case, a court held that a provision in the renewal policy
expressly excluding losses arising from lead paint poisoning was enforceable.
The policy holder had argued that the addition of the lead exclusion in the
renewal policy had not been brought to its attention.  Ruling in favor of the
insurance company, the court stated that the policy holder was under sufficient
notice regarding changes in the policy given differences in the deductible, a
change in the premium, and the fact that notice was given to an agent.<p>
<p>
	Building owners should be alert to these insurance developments.  In the event
a claim for lead based injury is made, the owner's existing policy should be
examined and a claim filed with its carrier notwithstanding the general
pollution exclusion.  Should the carrier seek to impose a new exclusion in a
renewal policy, an inquiry should be made as to whether the exclusion can be
eliminated by the payment of an additional premium.<p>

Environmentally Contaminated Properties: New Investment Opportunities</h2>
<p>

The fear engendered from environmentally contaminated<p>
properties - such as buildings laden with asbestos or properties<p>
sitting atop oil spills - actually offers investment<p>
opportunities for sophisticated investors. Rather than shying<p>
away from such properties, investors are now recognizing that,<p>
assisted by accurate environmental assessment surveys and<p>
supplemented by liability insurance, discounts far deeper than<p>
the costs of clean up can be obtained from willing sellers.<p>
Indeed, it is not unheard of for a fear discount to be a multiple<p>
of the actual cost to clean the site.<p>
<p>
The first step in evaluating the viability of such a purchase is the
determination of the extent of contamination through site assessment surveys. A
Phase I survey is a<p>
preliminary review by an environmental expert of the use and<p>
ownership of the property as well as properties in the vicinity<p>
of the subject. Where property is known to contain environmental<p>
contaminants, a Phase II survey is performed. Such a survey<p>
evaluates the extent of contamination so as to determine the<p>
severity and cost of the required clean up.[[exclamdown]][[exclamdown]]Having
evaluated the extent of contamination, the evaluates the extent of
contamination so as to determine the severity and cost of the required clean
up. Having evaluated the extent of contamination, the prospective purchaser may
wish to determine <tt>whether there are third parties who may be liable for the
clean up (for example, where the contamination emanated offsite) or whether
clean up monies are available under the Federal Superfund program. As part of
this search for parties who may be liable and willing to share the cost of the
clean up, local environmental agencies should be consulted. These agencies may
add pressure on the responsible parties to contribute to the cost of clean
up.<p>
<p>
	The other component to evaluating the financial risks of acquiring
contaminated property is the availability of insurance. While most carriers
have avoided issuing insurance for environmental liabilities, a small group of
companies are now offering this form of insurance. As recently reported in New
York Times, one Colorado company made the determination that the costs of
environmental clean ups are quantifiable and can be evaluated on an insurance
risk basis. And, this same company is offering liability insurance on an
"occurrence" basis; not the more usual "claims made" basis. The importance of
this distinction is that under an "occurrence" policy, insurance will be
available if a claim is made many years after the coverage period, so long
asinsurance was in force on the alleged date of occurrence.<p>
<p>
	Armed with a detailed Phase II study, and a carrier willing to underwrite the
potential cost of clean up, an investor can make a rational evaluation of the
risk involved in acquiring a contaminated property. When approached in this
manner, property previously considered tainted may take on a new lustre.<p>

<TITLE>Cooperatives Can Assert Claims Against Unsold Shares</TITLE>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">
Cooperatives Can Assert Claims Against Unsold Shares</h2>
<p>

<P>Often the only property retained by a sponsor in a
cooperative conversion are the shares of the cooperative
allocated to apartments not sold under the offering plan, known
as "unsold shares". These unsold shares are, generally speaking,
the only asset against which the cooperative might enforce any
claims for nonperformance of sponsor obligations, such as the
construction or renovation of the premises.

<P>The Appellate Division for the First Department has now
ruled that a cooperative may assert a lien against the unsold
shares for such claims against the sponsor. In ALH Properties
Ten, Inc. v.306 100th Street Owners Corp., 191 A.D.2d 1, 600
N.Y.S.2d 443 (1st Dep't. 1993) the issue arose in connection with
the foreclosure and sale of the sponsor's unsold shares, which
had been pledged to a lender. At the time the sponsor pledged the
shares, the cooperative executed a recognition agreement
acknowledging the lender's rights as a lienor, but providing that
the shares could not be transferred upon foreclosure without the
cooperative's approval.

<P>Following the sponsors default on its loan, the lender
foreclosed on the unsold shares and notified the cooperative that
a foreclosure sale was scheduled to proceed, subject only to the
payment of all outstanding maintenance charges (i.e., rent) owed by the
sponsor to the cooperative. The cooperative countered that it had a first lien
upon the unsold shares for all indebtedness of the sponsor, including its
non-maintenance obligations relating to the construction of the building. The
cooperative also asserted that its lien was expressly provided for by its
by-laws and printed on each of its share certificates.<p>
<p>
	The foreclosure sale was conducted and an affiliate of the lender was the
successful bidder. The cooperative, however, refused to transfer the shares.
The lender and the successful bidder then commenced an action against the
cooperative seeking an order directing it to turn over the shares to the
bidder.<p>
<p>
	In ruling in favor of he cooperative, the Appellate Division held, among other
things, that shares of a cooperative corporation must be considered securities
pursuant to Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, thereby giving the
cooperative an "issuer's lien", which survives a foreclosure sale; provided,
however, that notice of the cooperative's lien, or other restraint on transfer
of the stock, was given to the purchaser.Unless all claims for the cooperative
were paid, it could refuse to transfer the shares. In ruling that shares in a
cooperative are "securities" within the meaning of Article 8, the Court
distinguished its oft cited decision in <u>Silverman</u> v. <u>Alcoa</u>
<u>Plaza</u> <u>Associates</u>, 37 A.D.2d 166, 323 N.Y.S.2d 39 (1st Dep't.
1971). "It is evident that the conclusion reached [in Silverman] has little
application to this case [and] the conclusion that Article 8 is wholly
inapplicable to cooperative stock, has lost its validity over time. Given the
obvious and major changes that have taken place with regard to the conversion
and ownership of cooperatives since 1971, it is clear that shares of stock in
cooperative corporations should now be included within the definition of
securities.<p>
<p>
	In ALH, the unsold shares contained a legend which stated, among other things,
that the shareholder's rights were subject to the cooperative's by-laws and the
proprietary lease and that the cooperative may refuse to transfer the shares
until all indebtedness due it is paid. The legend further stated that the
cooperative had a first lien on the shares for all sums due and to become due
under the proprietary lease.<p>
<p>
	The Appellate Division then determined that the legend on the shares, combined
with the bylaws, gave sufficient notice of the cooperative's lien on the shares
and of its right to restrict the transfer of the shares in the event any
outstanding indebtedness is owed by a shareholder including non-rent
obligations to the cooperative. The shares contained the legend:"The Directors
of this Corporation may refuse to consent to the transfer of the shares
represented by this certificate until any indebtedness of the shareholder to
the Corporation is paid. The Corporation by the terms of said By-laws and the
proprietary lease, has a first lien on the shares represented by this
certificate for all sums due and to become due under the proprietary lease."<p>
<p>
	As for the successful bidder, the Court concluded that it was a shareholder
subject to the provisions of the by-laws of the cooperative, as any other
purchaser of the shares would be. And, since the by-laws gave adequate notice
of the cooperative's lien for non-maintenance obligations, the bidder took
those shares subject to that lien.<p>

EPA Effort to Limit Lender Environmental Liability is Struck Down</h2>
<p>

	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D .C. Circuit has ruled that the EPA does
not have authority to limit the scope of a lender's potential environmental
liability under CERCLA (the "Superfund" Law). In so ruling, the Circuit Court
has breathed new life into the Fleet Factors case, which held that lenders can
be liable for the clean up of contaminated sites if they participated in the
financial management of a borrower's facility in such a manner to influence the
borrower's treatment of hazardous wastes.<p>
<p>
	Prior to the Fleet Factors ruling, lenders found comfort in the statutory
exemption from CERCLA for secured creditors. In an effort to limit potential
lender liability, as envisioned by CERCLA, the EPA sought to overcome the
effect of Fleet Factors by issuing its "Lender Liability Rule", which protected
lenders from liability if they refrained from the active participation in their
borrower's hazardous waste operations.<p>
<p>
	Under the Lender Liability Rule, a lender could undertake investigatory
actions before the creation of a security interest, monitor or inspect the
facility, and require the borrower to comply with environmental standards
without the risk of becoming liable for an environmental clean up.  A lender
could also engage in workout negotiations and activities.<p>
<p>
	In the event a lender acquired title to the property through foreclosure, as
long as it did not participate in the management of the facility prior to
foreclosure and makes a diligent effort to dispose of the property, liability
for hazardous waste clean up would not be imposed.<p>
<p>
	The Circuit Court, in voiding the Lender Liability Rule, found that EPA
exceeded its power and was, in effect, attempting to enact legislation in the
guise of rule making. All hope is not lost, however, that lender liability can
be reduced to the pre-Fleet Factor days. The Clinton administration has
recently introduced a series of amendments of CERCLA, including provisions
which would allow EPA to promulgate the type of Lender Liability Rule rejected
by the Second Circuit.<p>
<p>
	At present, however, lenders must be aware that Fleet Factors have been
revived and that their participation in the financial management of the
facility can lead to liability for the clean up of hazardous wastes.<p>

<TITLE>Absolute and Unconditional Guaranties Challenged by Court</TITLE>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">
Absolute and Unconditional Guaranties Challenged by Court</h2>
<p>
The use of boilerplate guaranties was once again challenged
in a recent case handed down by the U.S. District Court for the
Second Circuit. In Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.v Yanakas, 7
F.3d 310 (2d Cir. 1993), the federal Court of Appeals ruled that
the defendant/guarantor could introduce evidence of fraud at
trial which, if proven, would invalidate the guaranty.

<P>Prior to this ruling, New York Courts, relying on the case
of Citibank, N.A. v. Plapinger, 66 N.Y.2d 90 (1985), had barred
claims of fraud by guarantors where the guaranty seemingly
contained language disclaiming the guarantor's contention that
the guaranty was procured by fraud.
<P>In Plapinger, the defendants/guarantors presented evidence
that the lenders fraudulently induced them to sign a guaranty of
payment by promising them that a line of credit would be
extended. The guarantors also claimed the without that line of
credit, they would not have signed the guaranty. In spite of the
fact that the court found that the guarantors had presented
sufficient evidence to raise an issue of fact as to fraud in the
inducement, which the lenders did not refute, the Court held that
"[f]raud in the inducement of a guarantee.. is not a defense to
an action
on the guarantee when the guarantee recites that it is absolute and
unconditional irrespective of any lack of validity or enforceability of the
guarantee."<p>
<p>
	The key, as stated by the Court in <u>Plapinger</u>, is whether "the person
claiming to have been defrauded has by his own specific disclaimer of reliance
upon oral representations himself been "guilty of deliberately misrepresenting
[his] true intention." If so, then evidence may not be introduced to show that
the agreement was procured by fraud.<p>
<p>
	As in <u>Plapinger</u>, the <u>Yanakas</u> court was faced with a challenge by
a guarantor to an absolute and unconditional guaranty, and concluded that the
threshold question is one of the specificity of the guarantor's alleged
disclaimer. Where the disclaimer contained in a guaranty was not specific,
fraud claims would permitted to proceed; fraud claims would only be dismissed
where the disclaimer was "sufficiently specific to match the alleged fraud."
The court distinguished the guaranty before it from the one at issue in
<u>Plapinger</u>. First, the Court found that the guaranty signed by Yanakas
was a boilerplate guaranty, with no evidence that it was specifically
negotiated or tailored forthe particular transaction. More importantly, the
Court found that the guaranty did not purport to waive any defenses as to its
own validity. The guaranty recited that it was a continuing guaranty of payment
regardless of the validity and enforceability of the "Obligations", a term
defined so as to exclude the guaranty itself. Moreover, the guaranty contained
no other disclaimer of the existence of or reliance upon any representations by
the lender, and no blanket disclaimer as found in the guaranty in
<u>Plapinger</u>, as to other circumstances which might form a defense to an
action on the guaranty.<p>
<p>
	The <u>Yanakas</u> decision confirms the fact that the mere words "absolute
and unconditional" will not preclude a challenge to a guaranty based on fraud
in the inducement. Rather than relying on such boilerplate language, and in
order to protect both lender and guarantor, the parties should fully negotiate
an instrument which reflects their particular agreement, and which specifically
sets forth any representations made by either of the parties on which either or
both may justifiably rely.<p>

<TITLE>FDIC Directs Implementation of Environmental Management Plans</TITLE>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">
FDIC Directs Implementation of Environmental Management Plans.</H2>
<p>
	Now that those directly and indirectly responsible for environmental mishaps
are being held accountable, the rush to escape liability is on.  Earlier this
year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued a directive to
supervised institutions instructing each institution to develop and implement
an environmental risk management plan.  The motivation behind this directive is
to ensure that lending institutions are aware, prior to making a real estate
loan, of potential environmental risks that may affect the value of the
collateral for the loan or that could eventually result in environmental
liability for the lender.<p>
<p>
	The directive provides in broad terms the recommended structure for a lending
institution's environmental risk plan.  It instructs the board of directors of
the institution to approve a plan that includes staff training, policy
guidelines, environmental risk analysis, loan documentation standards and
environmental risk assessment during workouts and foreclosures.  A senior
officer "knowledgeable in environmental matters" should be responsible for the
implementation of this program.<p>
<p>
	These guidelines will be enforced by FDIC examiners during their review of an
institution's lending and investment activities.  The directive notes, however,
that the environmental risk plan appropriate for a lending institution with a
concentration of loans to high risk industries or communities will require a
more elaborate assessment process than that necessary for an institution that
has most of its loans collateralized by 1-4 family residences.  The directive
is noteworthy, however, for its recommendation that an environmental risk plan
is appropriate for residential lending.<p>
<p>
	Much of the information necessary for the initial environmental risk analysis
can be obtained during the application process.  Questions on the loan
application form should elicit the information necessary to point out
environmental concerns.  The account officer, who need not possess any
expertise with respect to environmental matters, should inquire about these
concerns while interviewing the applicant.  The account officer may also wish
to visit the site of the proposed collateral to see if any obvious
environmental problems exist.<p>
<p>
	If this initial analysis indicates the possibility of environmental problems,
the directive suggests a further investigation by a qualified individual who
may survey the past ownership and uses of the real property in question, as
well as contiguous parcels, and also look into the history of the borrower.
This two step approach to assessing environmental risk before the loan is made
is compatible with the two levels of inquiry established in the national
environmental due diligence standard adopted by the American Society for
Testing and Materials.<p>
<p>
	Although the thrust of the FDIC directive deals with assessing environmental
risks prior to the making of the loan, the directive recommends monitoring the
borrower and the real property collateral during the life of the loan.  The
directive cautions lenders not to "participate" in the management of the
business at the real property collateral, as this activity could trigger
liability under CERCLA (the "Superfund" Law), which liability can otherwise be
escaped under CERCLA's "innocent landowners" defense.<p>
<p>
	Inasmuch as the problem of "participating in the management" is especially
nettlesome if a lending institution takes title to real property collateral
through foreclosure or other means, the FDIC warns lending institutions to
assess carefully the environmental liability they may incur by such action.<p>

	The impact of the Clean Air Act on chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) has the real
estate industry bracing for a storm of refrigerant shortages and equipment shut
downs.  Not since the asbestos laws went into effect has the Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) regulations had such a profound effect on the
industry.  The production of many of the refrigerants now in use will cease
within the next few years, and some of their alternatives may be phased out as
better chemicals are found.  As the phaseout of CFC's will be completed by
January 1, 1996, serious shortages of refrigerants, as well as ordering delays
for equipment and plant shut downs, are expected.  In order to prepare
adequately for the new world order for refrigerants, users should become
familiar with the EPA's regulations<p>
<p>
	Environmental urgency, and particularly the threat of global warming, is at
the heart of the changes promulgated in Section 608 of the Clean Air Act.
Under this section, the EPA has established regulations that require service
practices that maximize recycling of ozone depleting compounds such as CFC's
and hydroclorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) during the servicing and disposal of air
conditioning and refrigeration equipment.  Worth noting are requirements that
call for the repair of substantial leaks in air conditioning and refrigeration
equipment, set certification requirements for technicians, reclaimers and
owners of recovery and recycling equipment, and establish safe disposal
requirements.  Section 608 also restricts the sale of refrigerants to certified
technicians.<p>
<p>
	Section 608 tackles the problem of refrigerant releases occurring during
servicing and disposal of air conditioning and refrigeration equipment because
such releases account for 50% to 95% of total emissions during the lifetime of
the equipment.  Those systems with charges greater than 50 pounds must have
substantial leaks repaired.  Whereas a 35% annual leak rate is established for
the industrial process and commercial refrigeration sectors as the point
requiring repairs, a 15% rate is established for comfort cooling, chillers and
all other equipment with charges over 50 pounds.<p>
<p>
	Under new disposal requirements, equipment that is generally dismantled on
site before disposal must have the refrigerant removed and recovered in
accordance with the EPA's requirements for servicing.  On the other hand,
equipment that typicallyenters the waste stream with the charge intact is
subject to special safe disposal requirements.  Section 608 establishes that
the final person in the disposal chain is responsible for insuring that the
coolants have been removed.  Section 608 notes that, although CFC's are
generally not considered hazardous under federal law, oils contaminated with
CFC's may require special disposal procedures under certain circumstances.<p>
<p>
	Representatives from the EPA warn that without proper planning, CFC users
could find themselves in a coolant crunch.  At a recent seminar sponsored by
The Building Owners' and Managers' Association of Greater New York discussing
CFC's and The Clean Air Act, Mavis Sanders, a program analyst with the EPA in
Washington recommended designating a "refrigeration manager" who, with the
support of upper level management, would be able to implement decisions of a
CFC plan.  Fines of $25,000 a day can be imposed by EPA for violations of the
Act.<p>

City Adopts Mandatory Recycling Rules</h2>
<p>

	The City of New York Department of Sanitation has adopted Rules Governing the
recycling of private carter-collected waste.  All commercial premises, other
than food and beverage service establishments, are now required to source
separate high grade office paper, newspapers, and other recyclable materials
that tend to be generated in large volume by these types of premises; they will
not, however, be required to source separate recyclable materials, such as
bottles and cans, that tend to be generated in large volume only by food and
beverage service establishments.  On the other hand, food and beverage service
establishments will have to source separate their bottles and cans, but they
will not have to source separate their high grade office paper.  For those
instances where a food or beverage service establishment occupies only part of
a premises, that part of the premises shall be subject only to the rules
applicable to food or beverage service establishments, and the rest of the
premises shall be subject only to the rules applicable to general commercial
premises.<p>
<p>
	Owners of commercial premises must arrange for the collection and recycling or
reuse of those designated recyclable materials generated at their premises.
They must also provide instructions and notices to tenants to ensure that
source separation is done properly, as well as providing for source separation
in those public areas of the premises where designated recyclable materials are
routinely generated.  Despite these responsibilities, however, owners will not
be required to separate recyclable materials that have not been properly
separated initially.<p>
<p>
	Violators of these provisions are liable for civil penalties under section
16-324 of the New York City Administrative Code, which provides for a $25
penalty for first violations; persistent violators, those committing four or
more violations within six months, are liable for penalties of $500 for each
violation.<p>

Housing Warranty Applied to Sponsors</h2>
<p>

	The "housing merchant" warranty, which imposes by legal implication a
contractual liability on a homebuilder for skillful performance and quality of
a newly constructed home, has now been applied to co-op and condo sponsors.
(<u>The</u> <u>Board</u> <u>of</u> <u>Managers</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Astor</u> <u>Terrace</u> <u>Condominium</u> v. <u>93rd</u> <u>Street</u>
<u>Associates</u>, 583 N.Y.S.2d 398, 183 A.D.2.d 488 [1st Dept. 1992]).<p>
<p>
	The reasoning of the Court in <u>Astor</u> <u>Terrace</u> was primarily drawn
from the Court of Appeals's 1988 decision in <u>Caceci</u> v. <u>DiCanio</u>
<u>Construction Corp</u> (72 N.Y.2d 52 [1988]).  The Court there was faced with
homeowners who had contracted with a construction firm for the building and
sale of a new home.  Material defects, determined to be the result of the
construction firm's slipshod work, appeared after the one year guarantee period
had expired.  The Court held that the longer statute of limitations period
applied, ruling that "there is an implied term in the express contract between
the builder-vendor and purchasers that the house to be constructed would be
done in a skillful manner free from material defects."  The Court continued by
stating that this implication is "wholly consistent with the express terms of
the contract and with the reasonable expectation of the purchasers."  <p>
<p>
	In view of this, and despite defendant's argument that departure from the rule
of "caveat emptor" is such a drastic change of policy that only the legislature
should take this step, the Court ruled for the purchaser and required
homebuilders to meet the "housing merchant" warranty which could not be
shortened by contract.<p>
<p>
	The decision in <u>Astor</u> <u>Terrace</u> expanded this reasoning to
construction professionals and sponsors of condominiums and held that the
construction professionals are also liable to the condominium purchasers as
third-party beneficiaries.<p>
<p>
	Third party claims must rest on an intention of the parties to the contract to
benefit that third party.  However, facts and circumstances surrounding the
contract, in addition to its express language, may meet this requirement.  The
argument of the construction professionals in <u>Astor</u> <u>Terrace</u>, that
the language of their contracts makes clear, that they did not intend to confer
benefits on any third parties, ran up against some difficult facts.  The Court
noted that purchasers of condominium units are arguably the only intended
beneficiaries of the construction,especially where, as in <u>Astor</u>
<u>Terrace</u>, the sponsor's ownership can end prior to the completion of the
construction.  Further, the offering plan and other selling documents contained
language implying the purchasers of the units were beneficiaries.<p>
<p>
	Given these facts, and given the Court's inclination to expand the rights of
purchasers of newly constructed housing, the <u>Astor</u> <u>Terrace</u> Court
found the reliance by the purchasers on the representations of the construction
contracts to be reasonable.  <u>Astor</u> <u>Terrace</u> and <u>Caceci</u>
suggests that the spirit of "caveat emptor" has been completely eliminated in
the field of home construction.  Notably, the Court in <u>Astor</u>
<u>Terrace</u> also upheld the claims of negligence against the design
professionals, finding that they owed a duty to the condominium purchasers,
even though there was no "privity" between the purchasers and the
professionals.<p>

The Armyant Project  </TITLE>
<BODY>
<H1> The "Armyant" Robotics Project</H1><HR>
<H2>Overview</H2>
The "armyant" project is a mobile robotics research project whose goal is to study intelligent mobile robots similar to social insects.</P>
These robots would be small, inexpensive, and simple.  They would derive their usefulness from their ability to work together in teams.  They would be physically identical, making them a <EM> homogeneous </EM> system of cooperating agents.</P>
Among the advantages of such a team are:</P>
<UL><LI>
<B>Simplicity:</B>  They would be inexpensive to mass produce, which would be necessary for their deployment in large quantities. They would be easily altered, and could be easily maintained.</P>
<LI>
<B>Inexpensive:</B>  Being mass-producible, they would be considerably cheaper than conventional mobile robots of today.  This might make them expendible if necessary.</P>
<LI>
<B>Homogeneity:</B>  All robots will be physically alike.  They will therefore rely on no central supervisor, controller, or knowledge source.  Although they can be peforming different tasks at different times, no robot will have any inherent capabilities different from any other robot.  They are thus completely interchangeable.  </P>
<LI>
<B>Modularity:</B> Because of their homogeneity, they can work together in arbitrarily sized teams.  They can split into sub-groups and gather into larger organizations.  There is no risk of an incomplete hierarchy or command structure, because their collective abilities are independent of individual identities.</P>
</UL>

<H2>Applications</H2>
The armyant robots were initially designed for applications in materials handling, wherein the payload might be arbitrarily large and heavy, un-palletized, and in a remote location.  Other possible applications include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Mining:</B>  Materials removal and rescue operations.</P>
<LI>
<B>Mine Sweeping:</B>  Land and sea.</P>
<LI>
<B>Surveying and Search:</B>  Dispersal into uniform grids on uneven terrain; search-and-rescue.</P>
<LI>

 <H1>Doctrine Optimization</H1>
<HR><P>
<H2>Overview</H2>
This page describes work being performed for the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division.  The goal of the project is to generate a set of rules ("doctrine") that optimizes the decisions taken in specific tactical scenarios.  The system must intepret radar and sonar data on perhaps many targets, as well as ownship's internal status, conditions, etc.  For example, one rule might be of the form: <P>
<code><pre> 
IF (track1) has
	(altitude A) 		and
	(bearing B)		and
	(closing rate C)	and
	(has not identified as friend)
  THEN
	(fire chaff)
</code></pre>
<P><P><P>
Such an optimizer might be used as an off-line "what-if" scenario simulator.  Such a simulator might become part of the Tactical Action Operator's Associate (TAOA).  The Tactical Action Operator (TAO) is in charge of such decision-making.  The TAOA would be an intelligent decision aid to optimize choice of actions in complex tactical environments, such as with many tracks and with communication with other U.S. Navy vessels.
A pictoral representation of the system is shown below:

Methods
</H2>
The technique we use to optimize the doctrine set is the <B>Learning Classifier System (LCS)</B>. The LCS is an adaptive production system that uses genetic algorithms to evolve a working set of rules.  It is message-based and may be distributed into <B>independent agents</B> that can optimize, in parallel, different rules in different situations and with different evaluation criteria.
