<P>Raising and nurturing a gifted child can be an exciting yet daunting challenge.  Unfortunately, these complicated little people do 
not come with instruction manuals.  The following new definition 
of giftedness highlights the complexity of raising gifted children.</P>

<P>Giftedness is asynchronous development in which advanced cognitive abilities and heightened intensity 
combine to create inner experiences and awareness 
that are qualitatively different from the norm.  This 
asynchrony increases with higher intellectual capacity.  
The uniqueness of the gifted renders them particularly 
vulnerable and requires modifications in parenting, 
teaching and counseling in order for them to develop 
optimally.  (The Columbus Group, 1991, in Morelock, 
1992)</P>

<P>Asynchrony means being out of sync, both internally and externally.  Asynchronous development means that gifted children 
develop cognitively at a much faster rate than they develop 
physically and emotionally, posing some interesting problems.  
For example, ideas forged by 8-year-old minds may be difficult to 
produce with 5-year-old hands.  Further, advanced cognition 
often makes gifted children aware of information that they are not 
yet emotionally ready to handle.  They tend to experience all of 
life with greater intensity, rendering them emotionally complex.  
These children usually do not fit the developmental norms for 
their age; they have more advanced play interests and often are 
academically far ahead of their age peers.  The brighter the child, 
the greater the asynchrony and potential vulnerability.  
Therefore, parents who are aware of the inherent developmental 
differences of their children can prepare themselves to act as 
their advocates.</P>

<a name="Recognition"></a>
<H3>Recognition</H3>

<P>Some of the earliest signs of giftedness include:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI>unusual alertness in infancy
        	<LI>less need for sleep in infancy
        	<LI>long attention span
        	<LI>high activity level
        	<LI>smiling or recognizing caretakers early
        	<LI>intense reactions to noise, pain, frustration
        	<LI>advanced progression through the developmental milestones
        	<LI>extraordinary memory
        	<LI>enjoyment and speed of learning 
        	<LI>early and extensive language development
        	<LI>fascination with books
        	<LI>curiosity
        	<LI>excellent sense of humor
        	<LI>abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills
        	<LI>vivid imagination (e.g., imaginary companions)
        	<LI>sensitivity and compassion
</UL>

<P>If a child exhibits a majority of these characteristics, parents 
may wish to have the child assessed by an experienced examiner to find out if the child is gifted.  Firstborn children tend to be 
recognized more often than their siblings.  When one child in the 
family is gifted, it is quite possible that others may also be gifted.  
Early identification is recommended (ages 3 through 8) because 
it permits early intervention, as important for gifted as for any 
other children with special needs.</P>

<a name="Responsive"></a>
<H3>Responsive Parenting</H3>

<P>Children learn first from their parents.  Parents who spend time 
with their gifted child are more able to tune in to their child's interests and respond by offering appropriate educational enrichment 
opportunities.    It is important that parents read to their children 
frequently, even when the children are capable of reading to 
themselves.  In the early years, parents can help their children 
discover their personal interests, expose their children to their 
own interests, and encourage their children to learn about a wide 
variety of subjects such as art, nature, music, museums, and 
sports.  Children who are attracted to a particular area need opportunities to explore that field in depth.  Home stimulation and 
support of interests is vital to the development of talents.  
Following the lead of the child will help the child flourish.</P>

<a name="Family"></a>
<H3>Family Relationships</H3>

<P>Gifted children often can exhaust and overwhelm a new mother 
and father.  Gifted infants often sleep less than other babies and 
require extra stimulation when they are awake.  It is helpful to 
have extended family in the home, grandparents who live nearby, 
a close community of friends or relatives, or a teenager in the 
neighborhood who can spend some time with the child so that the 
primary caretakers can get some rest to do other things.  For 
single parents, such support is particularly important.  From the 
time they can talk, gifted children are constantly asking questions and often challenge authority.  "Do it because I said so" 
doesn't work with these children.  Generally, parents who take 
the time to explain requests get more cooperation than do more 
authoritarian parents.  If these children are spoken to and listened to with consideration and respect, they tend to respond respectfully.</P>

<P>As children get older, a family meeting can be a good way of 
sharing responsibility and learning negotiation skills.  Family 
meetings can provide a forum where children have a voice as a 
family member, and provide avenues for avoiding power struggles that otherwise can occur.  It is important for gifted children 
to feel emotionally supported by the family even when there are 
disagreements. </P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>
<a name="School"></a>
<H3>School Placement</H3>

<P>Gifted children generally benefit by spending at least some time 
in the classroom with children of similar abilities.  Their educational program should be designed to foster progress at their own 
rate of development.  Parents who become involved with the 
school can help administrators and teachers be responsive to 
the needs of these children.  Open, flexible environments provide 
students with opportunities for choices, and enhance independence and creativity.  "In Search of the Perfect Program" 
(Silverman &amp; Leviton, 1991) includes a checklist of specific qualities to look for in a school.</P>

Early entrance or other forms of acceleration may be considered 
when the school gifted program is not sufficiently challenging or 
when there is no opportunity for gifted children to be grouped with 
age peers who are intellectually advanced.  Early entrance is the 
easiest form of acceleration, academically and socially.  It may 
be best to accelerate girls before third grade or after ninth grade, 
when they are less bonded to their peer group.  Boys are usually 
more willing to skip grades at any point in their school program.  
Excellent guidelines for acceleration are provided by Feldhusen 
(1992).  When a child expresses a willingness to be accelerated, 
the chances are good that an excellent social adjustment will be 
made.

<P>In the preschool and primary years, mixed-aged groupings are 
beneficial, as long as the gifted child is not the oldest in the 
group.  Gifted, creative boys are often held back in the primary 
years because of so-called "immaturity" - the inability to socialize with age peers who are less developmentally advanced.  
When a 5-year-old boy with an 8-year-old mind cannot relate to 5- 
year-olds, nothing is gained by having him repeat a grade:  he is 
then a 6-year-old with a 9-year-old mind trying to relate to 5-year-
olds!  The best solution is to find him true peers boys his own 
age who are intellectually advanced.  Retention is not recommended.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>
<a name="Parent"></a>
<H3>Parent Advocacy</H3>

<P>Gifted children need strong, responsible advocates, and parent 
groups can make a difference.  It takes persistence of large 
groups of parents to assure that provisions for gifted children are 
kept firmly in place.  Parents of children who are gifted need opportunities to share parenting experiences with each other, and 
parent groups can provide a place where that can happen.</P>

<P>It is important for parents of any children with special needs to 
meet with the teachers early in the school year.  When parents 
and teachers work together, appropriate programs can be developed and problems can be caught early.  It is helpful for parents 
to offer to assist their child's teacher by making or locating supplemental materials, helping in the classroom or library, offering 
expertise to small groups of students, or finding others who can 
provide other enrichment experiences.  Effective parents stay 
involved in their children's education and informed about gifted 
education in general.  When a teacher makes a special effort to 
understand or assist a gifted child, a note to the teacher or to the 
principal is generally appreciated.  </P>

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>The key to raising gifted children is respect:  respect for their 
uniqueness, respect for their opinions and ideas, respect for 
their dreams.  Gifted children need parents who are responsive 
and flexible, who will go to bat for them when they are too young 
to do so for themselves.  It is painful for parents to watch their 
children feeling out of sync with others, but it is unwise to emphasize too greatly the importance of fitting in.  Children get 
enough of that message in the outside world.  At home, children 
need to know that their uniqueness is cherished and that they are 
appreciated as persons just for being themselves.</P>

<h3> <a name="Foreword">Foreword</a></h3>

<P>We have written this Parent's Guide to help families learn how to

get help for their young children with special needs (ages birth

through 5 years).</P>



<P>We have posed the most asked questions about early intervention

services for children ages birth through 2 years old and special

education and related services for children ages 3 through 5

years old.</P>



<P>The rules or guidelines for special education in  the United

States and its territories are outlined in a federal law known as

the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), formerly

known as the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA).  Each state

or territory develops its own policies for carrying out this Act.

(You can read more about this law later in this document.)</P>



<P>You'll need to find out what the early intervention or special

education policies are in your state and area.  The list of

agencies and contact people in your state should help you get

started.  A NICHCY State Resource Sheet for your state is

available from NICHCY.</P>



<P>The phrases "children with special needs" or "special needs

children" are used throughout this document to refer to children

who have disabilities or who are at risk of developing

disabilities.</P>



<P>Many of the special education words that appear in this Parent's

Guide are defined in the Parent's Dictionary that appears toward

the end of this document.  </P>

<h3> <a name="PART I:">PART I:  Questions and Answers About Early
Intervention Services

For Infants and Toddlers Who Have a Developmental Delay or Who

Are At Risk of a Developmental Delay

(Ages Birth Through 2 Years Old) </a></h3>
<P>Note:   Many of the words below may be new to you, but they are

those that are commonly used in special education.  We have used

these terms to help you become familiar with them.  You can find

their definitions in the Parent's Dictionary towards the end of

this document.  </P>



<P>We have used the term "parent" to mean anyone who is in charge of

the care and well-being of a child.  These can be guardians,

single parents, grandparents, surrogate parents, foster parents,

or other family members.</P>





<P>The federal law known as Public Law (P.L.) 102-119 guarantees

certain rights to young children (ages birth to 5) with special

needs.  This law is the most recent amendment to IDEA.  (To learn

more about this, see the section entitled "Information About

IDEA.")</P>



<B>Q:   What should I do if I think my child has special needs?</B>



<P>A:   First, you'll need to find out if your infant or toddler is

eligible for early intervention services.  There are many people

who can help you with this.  We will explain how to get the help

you need in the pages that follow.</P>



<B>Q:   What are early intervention services?</B>



<P>A:   These are services for infants and toddlers that are

designed to identify and treat a problem or delay as early as

possible.  Early intervention services are offered through a

public or private agency and are provided in different settings,

such as the child's home, a clinic, a neighborhood daycare

center, hospital, or the local health department.</P>



<P>     Early intervention services can range from prescribing

glasses for a two-year-old to developing a complete physical

therapy program for an infant with cerebral palsy.</P>



<B>Q:   Who do I contact first for help?</B>



<P>A:   Each state decides which of its agencies will be the lead

agency in charge of early intervention services for infants and

toddlers with special needs.  In your state, the first contact

person may be an early interventionist (an early childhood

specialist working with infants and toddlers), someone with the

lead agency, or someone in your state's Child Find office.</P>



<P>     To find out who can help you in your area, contact the

person listed on your State Resource Sheet under "Programs for

Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities."  If you don't have a

State Resource Sheet, call NICHCY at 1-800-695-0285 (Voice/TT).

Explain that you want to find out about early intervention

services for your child and ask for a name in your area.</P>



<P>     Important.  Write down the names and phone numbers of

everyone you talk to.  (You can use the Sample Record-Keeping

Worksheet on the last page of this document as a guide.)  Having

this information available may be helpful to you later on.</P>



<B>Q:   What do I say when I talk to my local contact person?</B>



<P>A:   Explain that you think your child may need early

intervention services and you would like to arrange for an

evaluation and assessment.  Write down any information you are

given.</P>



<B>Q:   What is an evaluation and assessment?

</B>

<P>A:   Evaluation refers to the procedures used to determine if a

child is eligible for early intervention services.  Assessment

refers to the ongoing process of gathering and using information

about how a child is developing and determining what kind of help

he or she might need.  </P>



<P>     In regards to your child, this information may come from

some or all of the following:</P>



<P>     -    Doctors' reports;<BR>

     -    Results from developmental tests given to your child;<BR>

     -    Your child's medical history;<BR>

     -    Observations and feedback from all members of the

multidisciplinary team, including parents; and<BR>

     -    Any other important observations, records, and/or

reports about your child.</P>



<B>Q:   Who does the  evaluation and assessment?</B>



<P>A:   It depends on your state's policies or rules.  Ask your

local contact person about this.  Usually, a team of

professionals, which may include a psychologist, an early

interventionist, and an occupational or physical therapist, will

evaluate a child.</P>



<B>Q:   Who pays for the assessment?</B>



<P>A:   Under P.L.102-119, evaluations and assessments are provided

at no cost to families.  Check with your contact person for local

guidelines.</P>



<B>Q:   Will I have to pay for any services if my child is found

eligible?</B>



<P>A:   Usually, services are provided at no cost to the family.

You may have to pay for some services, depending on your state's

policies.  Check with the contact person in your area or state.

Some services may be covered by your health insurance, by

Medicaid, or by Indian Health Services.</P>



<P>     In some areas, you may be charged a "sliding-scale" fee that

is based on what you earn.  Every effort is made to provide

services to all infants and toddlers who need help, regardless of

family income.</P>



<B>Q:   What is a service coordinator (case manager)?

</B>

<P>A:   When a child's needs are assessed and the child is found

eligible for services, a service coordinator will be assigned to

the family.  This person should have a background in early

childhood development and methods for helping young children who

may have developmental delays.  The service coordinator should

know the policies for early intervention programs and services in

your state.  This person can help you locate other services in

your community, such as recreation, child care, or family support

groups.  The service coordinator will work with your family as

long as your baby is receiving early intervention services and,

after your child is 2 years old, the service coordinator will

help your family move on to programs for children ages 3 through

5.</P>



<B>Q:   What is an IFSP?</B>



<P>A:    The family and the service coordinator work with other

professionals, as appropriate, to  develop an Individualized

Family Service Plan, or IFSP.  The guiding principal of the IFSP

is that the family is a child's greatest resource, that a baby's

needs are closely tied to the needs of their family.  The best

way to support children and meet their needs is to support and

build upon the individual strengths of their family.  So the IFSP

is a whole family plan with the parents as the most important

part of the IFSP team.  Involvement of other team members will

depend on what the baby needs.  These other team members could

come from several agencies, and may include medical people,

therapists, child development specialists, social workers, and

others.  </P>



<P>     The IFSP will describe the following:  the child's

development levels; family information (with parents'

concurrence); the major outcomes expected to be achieved for the

child and family; the services the child will be receiving; when

and where he or she will receive these services, and the steps to

be taken to support his or her transition to another program.

The IFSP will identify the service coordinator.  The IFSP may

also identify services the family may be interested in, such as

financial information or information about raising a child with a

disability.</P>



<P>     Each state has developed specific guidelines for the IFSP.

Your service coordinator can explain what the IFSP guidelines are

in your state.</P>



<B>Q:   Are there any parent groups in my area that can give me more

information about early intervention services?

</B>



<P>A:   There are several types of parent groups, including:</P>



<P>     -    Support groups (such as Parent-to-Parent) for families

of children with disabilities;<BR>

     -    Parent training and information programs funded by the

federal government, such as the Technical Assistance for Parent

Programs (TAPP) Project; and<BR>

     -    Groups concerned with a specific disability, such as

United Cerebral Palsy Associations, Inc. (UCPA) or the Arc

(formerly the Association for Retarded Citizens of the United

States).</P>



<P>     We have listed some of these groups on the State Resource

Sheet.</P>



<P>     Parent groups can offer information, support, and/or

training to families of children with disabilities to help

parents take a more active role in helping their children.

Through such groups, families meet other families with similar

needs to discuss resources, day-to-day problems, and personal

insights.</P>



<P>     Your service coordinator or someone at your local school may

be able to tell you about nearby groups.  For more details on

parent groups, contact NICHCY (1-800-695-0285) and ask for our

"Parent's Guide to Accessing Parent Programs."</P>



<B>Q:   I still have a lot of questions.  How can I find out more

about special education laws and about early intervention

services?</B>



<P>A:   See the section of this document entitled <a
href="#IDEA">Information About IDEA</a>

 for more information on one of the most important special

education laws.  Also, see the <a href="#References">References for
Families</a>

 section for selected

additional information on the development of infants and toddlers

with disabilities, on early intervention programs and services,

and on raising and caring for a young child with special needs.</P>



<P>     As time goes by and your child begins to receive services,

you will probably have more questions.  For example, you might

want to know:</P>



<P>     -    How do I check on the services my child is getting?<BR>

     -    What do I do if I am not satisfied with my child's

assessment, program, or progress?<BR>

     -    What happens to my child once he/she is too old for the

program?<BR>

     -    What about private therapists and private schools?</P>



<P>     For answers to these and other questions, talk to your

service coordinator, contact a parent support and/or training

group in your area, or contact NICHCY.</P>



<P>     We hope these materials are useful.  If you need more help

<h3> <a name="PART II:">PART II:

Questions and Answers About Special Education Programs

and Services for Preschoolers with Disabilities

(Ages 3 Through 5 Years Old) </a></h3>





<P>     Note:  Many of the words below may be new to you, but they

are terms that are commonly used in special education.  We have

used these terms to help you become familiar with them.  You can

look up their definitions in the Parent's Dictionary towards the

end of this document.</P>



<P>     The phrases "special education," "special education

programs," "special education services," and "special education

programs and services" are used interchangeably in this section.</P>



<P>     Below are answers to questions people often ask about

special education programs and services for preschool children

(ages 3 through 5 years old) who have disabilities.</P>



<P>     A federal law known as Public Law (P.L.) 102-119 guarantees

certain rights to young children (ages birth to 5) with special

needs.  This law is the most recent amendment to Public Law

(P.L.) 94-142, The Education For All Handicapped Children's Act,

now called the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA).</P>



<B>Q:   What should I do if I think my preschool child needs special

education?</B>



<P>A:   If you think your preschooler needs special education, you

will first want to find out if he or she is eligible for a

special education program.  There are people who can help you

with this.  Read on, and we will explain how to contact them.</P>



<B>Q:   What are special education programs?</B>



<P>A:   Special education programs are specially designed programs

in public schools offered at no cost to families of children with

disabilities.  Today, under P.L.102-119, all schools must offer

special education services to eligible 3-5 year olds with

disabilities.</P>



<B>Q:   Who do I contact first for help?</B>



<P>A:   The best place to start is your local public elementary

school.  (In most cases, this would be the school that other

children who live near you attend.)  Call and ask to speak to the

principal or to someone in charge of special education at the

school.</P>



<P>     If this doesn't work, look on the NICHCY State Resource

Sheet under "State Department of Education."  Call the Early

Childhood Specialist for children ages 3-5 years and ask for the

name and phone number of the person in your area in charge of

these programs.  Explain that you want to find out about special

education services for your child.  Ask what you need to do to

arrange for an evaluation.</P>



<P>     Write down the names and phone numbers of everyone you talk

to.  (As a guide, you can use the Sample Record-Keeping Worksheet

at the end of this document.)  Having this information available

may be helpful to you later on.</P>



<B>Q:   What is an evaluation?</B>



<P>A:   Evaluation means the procedures used to determine whether a

child has a disability and the extend of the special education

and related services the child needs.  In regards to your child,

this information may come from:</P>



<P>     -    Doctors' reports;<BR>

     -    Results from developmental tests given to your child;<BR>

     -    Your child's medical history;<BR>

     -    Observations and feedback from all members of the

assessment team, including parents; and<BR>

     -    Any other important observations, records, and/or

reports about your child.</P>



<B>Q:   Who conducts my child's evaluation?</B>



<P>A:   Your child's evaluation will be conducted by a

multidisciplinary team of group of persons.  Who is involved will

depend on the rules in your state or school district.  Ask your

school contact person what the policy is for getting an

evaluation for your child.</P>



<B>Q:   Will I have to pay for the evaluation or for any services my

child may be eligible for?

</B>

<P>A:   Special education services are offered for 3-5-year-olds at

no cost to parents.  The assessment and evaluation process is

considered part of these services and is provided at no cost to

families.</P>



<B>Q:   Are there any parent groups in my area that can give me more

information about special education?

</B>

<P>A:   There are several types of parent programs, including:</P>



<P>     -    Support groups (such as Parent-to-Parent) for families

of children with disabilities;<BR>

     -    Parent training and information programs funded by the

federal government, such as the Technical Assistance for Parent

Programs (TAPP) Project; and<BR>

     -    Groups concerned with a specific disability, such as

United Cerebral Palsy Associations, Inc. (UPCA), or the Arc

(formerly the Association for Retarded Citizens of the United

States).</P>



<P>     We have listed some of these groups on your State Resource

Sheet.  You can also check with someone in your local school or

call NICHCY.</P>



<P>     Parent groups can offer information, support, and/or

training to families of children with disabilities to help them

take a more active role in their children's education.  Through

such groups, families meet other families with similar needs to

discuss local resources, daily problems, and personal insights.

For more details on these and other parent groups, contact NICHCY

and ask for our "Parent's Guide to Accessing Parent Groups."</P>



<B>Q:   I still have a lot of questions.  How can I find out more

about special education programs and services?</B>



<P>A:   See the section entitled <a href="#IDEA">Information About
IDEA</a>  to learn

more about one of the most important special education laws.

Also, see the "References" section towards the end of this

document for information on raising and caring for a young child

with special needs.</P>



<P>     Once your child has been found eligible for special

education, you will most likely have more questions.  For

example:</P>



<P>     -    How do I check on my child's special education program?<BR>

     -    What do I do if I am not satisfied with my child's

assessment, placement, program, or progress?<BR>

     -    What happens to my child when he or she is too old for

the program?<BR>

     -    What about private therapists and private schools?</P>



<P>For answers to these and other questions, talk to your special

education coordinator or school principal or contact a parent

support and/or training group in your area.</P>



<P>Also, write to NICHCY and ask for a copy of "Questions Often

Asked About Special Education Services" and/or the longer, more

detailed "Questions and Answers about the Individuals with

Disabilities Education Act."  Both documents contain information

about special education laws and parents' rights in getting

school services for their children with disabilities.</P>



<P>We hope these materials are useful.  If you need more help or

information from NICHCY, please call us at 1-800-695-0285

<h3> <a name="PART III:">

PART III: Questions and Answers About Programs and Services for

Rural, Native American, Adoptive/Foster, and Military

Families and Their Young Children With Disabilities </a></h3>









<B>Q:   What about services for families in remote or rural areas?</B>



<P>A:   The goals of early intervention or special education

programs and services for young children with special needs is

the same for both rural and urban families.  However, the ways in

which these services are offered may be different.  Two groups

that may be able to offer information specifically about services

for rural families are:</P>



<P>          American Council on Rural Special Education (ACRES)<BR>

          University of Utah<BR>

          Department of Special Education<BR>

          Milton Bennion Hall<BR>

          Salt Lake City, UT 84112<BR>

          Telephone: (801) 585-5659</P>



<P>          Rural Institute on Disabilities<BR>

          52 Corbin Hall<BR>

          The University of Montana<BR>

          Missoula, MT 59812<BR>

          Telephone: (800) 732-0323</P>



<B>Q:   What about services for Native American families living on

reservations?</B>



<P>A:   The lead agency for the state is responsible for seeing that

early intervention programs and services are provided to infants

and toddlers (ages birth through two years) with special needs in

the state.  The State Education Agency (SEA) is responsible for

seeing that programs and services are provided to preschool

children (ages three through five) with special needs.  These

requirements include Native American infants, toddlers, and

children living on reservations.  Information on these services

is available from the lead agency, from the SEA, or by contacting

the office of the tribal leader or the tribal education

committee.  Local public or BIA schools and Indian Health Service

(IHS) offices and clinics are also possible sources of

information.</P>



<B>Q:   What information and support groups are available to help

families?</B>



<P>A:   There are several types of parent groups including:</P>



<P>     -    Support groups (such as Parent-to-Parent) for families

of children with disabilities;<BR>

     -    Parent training and information programs funded by the

federal government, including some specializing in services for

Indian families; and<BR>

     -    Groups concerned with a specific disability, such as

United Cerebral Palsy Associations, Inc. (UCPA) or the Arc

(formerly the Association for Retarded Citizens of the United

States).</P>



<B>Q:   What additional information do families of adopted or foster

children with disabilities need about early intervention or

special education services?</B>



<P>A:   In general, the process for getting early intervention or

special education programs and services for adopted children with

special needs is the same as it is for all children with special

needs.</P>



<P>     An organization that has a nationwide family support network

of adoptive families is Adoptive Families of America (AFA).

While the main focus of this organization is to provide general

help and information to all adoptive families, its bimonthly

parent support magazine includes information and resources for

families of adopted children who have special needs.</P>



<P>     Their address is:</P>



<P>          Adoptive Families of America, Inc. (AFA)<BR>

          3333 Highway 100, North<BR>

          Minneapolis, MN  55422<BR>

          Telephone:  (612) 535-4829</P>



<P>     Families who provide foster homes to children who have

disabilities or who are at risk of developing disabilities may

want to contact the National Foster Parent Association, Inc.

(NFPA).  This national, non-profit group offers information and

support to all foster parents.  Members of the group receive a

bimonthly newsletter and have access to nearly 500 NFPA resource

materials.</P>



<P>     For the Information/Services Office of NFPA, contact:</P>



<P>          National Foster Parent Association, Inc.<BR>

          Information/Services Office<BR>

          226 Kilts Drive<BR>

          Houston, TX  77024<BR>

          Telephone:  (713) 467-1850<BR>

          Fax:  (713) 827-0919</P>



<B>Q:   How do I find out about programs and services for military

families whose young children have special needs?</B>



<P>A:   One way is through a project known as Specialized Training

of Military Parents (STOMP).  This organization provides

information and help to military families (both in the U.S. and

overseas) who have children with special needs.</P>



<P>     The STOMP staff is made up of parents of children with

special needs who are trained to work with other parents of

children with special needs.  As spouses of members of the

military, the staff understands the unique needs of military

families.</P>



<P>     To contact STOMP, call or write:</P>



<P>          Specialized Training of Military Parents (STOMP)<BR>

          12208 Pacific Highway, S.W.<BR>

          Tacoma, WA  98499<BR>

          Telephone:  (206) 588-1741  (Parents can call collect.)</P>



<P>     Another way to learn more about early intervention and

special education programs and services for children in military

families stateside is to contact the Community Service Center

(also called Family Service Center or Family Resource Center) or

the assigned community contact person on your installation.</P>



<P>     While most children of military families attend (or will

attend) public schools, some are in Section VI schools.  Section

VI schools provide early intervention services and special

education services in accordance with the Interim Final Rules

issues in the Federal Register on October 6, 1993 (Federal

Register, Volume 58, Number 192, pages 51996-52010).  As of July

1994, a final Department of Defense Instruction in this regard is

anticipated.  Once this Instruction is issued, copies should be

available at each local military installation, Section VI school,

Superintendent's Office.</P>



<P>     The office of Department of Defense Dependent Schools

(DODDS) overseas issues a handbook for military families with

children who have special needs and who are receiving, or are

eligible to receive, a free appropriate public education through

DODDS overseas.  To order the handbook, write or call:</P>



<P>          Department of Defense Dependent Schools<BR>

          4040 North Fairfax Drive<BR>

<h3> <a name="IDEA">Information About IDEA</a></h3>
<P>For the past 25 years, laws have been passed by Congress

instructing states to provide education for children and youth

with disabilities.  Public Law 94-142, the Education For All

Handicapped Children Act (EHA), was passed by Congress and signed

into law by President Ford in 1975.  This law is well known; it

required states to fully educate all children with disabilities.

It has been amended several times.  In 1986, the EHA was amended

through P.L. 99-457 to, among other things, lower the age at

which children can receive special services to three years old.

It also established the Handicapped Infants and Toddlers Program

(Part H), which is for children who need help from birth to their

third birthday.  The amendments of 1990 and 1991 brought about

more changes, among which was a change in the name.  Now the EHA

will be called IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education

Act.</P>



<B>Information About Programs for Children Ages 3-21</B>



<P>IDEA requires that all states and territories provide a public

school education to children with disabilities from ages 3 to 21,

no matter how severe their disabilities are.</P>



<P>There are several basic rights that this law promises to children

with disabilities (ages 3 to 21) and their parents:</P>



<P>     -    The right to a "free appropriate public education" at

public expense (in some cases, this may include placing a child

in a private school);</P>



<P>     -    The right to an educational placement that is based on

an assessment and evaluation of each child's own special needs;</P>



<P>     -    The right of children with disabilities to receive

teaching or instruction that is designed to meet their needs;

these needs are to be clearly written and included in an

Individualized Education Program (IEP) for each child, with

statements about what services the child will receive;</P>



<P>     -    The right to a full range of educational services that

may include related services such as counseling, special

transportation, speech/language pathology, or occupational or

physical therapy;</P>



<P>     -    The right of parents (or guardians) to be included in

making decisions about their child's educational needs and to

approve the educational plans for their child; and</P>



<P>     -    The right of parents (or guardians) to appeal any

decisions made about the identification, evaluation, and

placement of the child through a due process procedure.</P>



<P>Finally, IDEA requires that children with disabilities be

educated in the "Least Restrictive Environment" (LRE), that is,

in a setting with children who have no disabilities, with special

help provided to those who need it.</P>



<B>Information About Programs for Very Young Children</B>



<P>Under the IDEA, early intervention services are to be made

available to infants and toddlers with disabilities, ages birth

through two years.  Services are not the same in all areas.  To

find out what is available where you live, call the early

childhood specialist in your school system or check under

"Programs for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities" on NICHCY's

State Resource Sheet.  You can also call NICHCY at 1-800-

695-0285 (Voice/TT) ask for assistance.</P>



<P>Congress made funds available to help states and territories plan

a comprehensive service system to provide the following services:</P>



<P>     -    Early intervention services to infants and toddlers

(ages birth through 2 years) with disabilities.  If a state

chooses to, it can also serve infants and toddlers at risk of

developing disabilities; and</P>



<P>     -    Special education programs and related services to

preschoolers (ages 3 through 5 years) who have disabilities.</P>



<P>Services for children 3 years old and up are provided by the

state department of education.  However, programs for children

under age 3 are provided by different agencies in different

states.  Sometimes the department of education will handle all

these programs; in other states it may be the health department

or another agency.</P>



<P>The term "infants and toddlers with disabilities" in the law

refers to children (ages birth through 2 years) who need early

intervention services in any of the following areas:</P>



<UL TYPE=DISC>

     	<LI>    Physical,

     	<LI>    Cognitive,

     	<LI>    Communication,

     	<LI>    Social or emotional, and/or

     	<LI>    Adaptive development.

</UL>



<P>Early intervention services must be provided by people who are

qualified to work with infants and toddlers who have disabilities

or who are at risk of developing disabilities.  Any services

provided must be written into an Individual Family Service Plan

(IFSP) that is reviewed every 6 months.</P>



<P>For more information about the laws that affect children with

disabilities and their families, call NICHCY at 1-800-695-0285

<h3> <a name="Worksheet">Parent's Record-keeping Worksheet</a></h3>

<P>The sample record-keeping worksheet below can help you start a

file of information about your child.  As you contact different

people and places, it's a good idea to keep records of people

you've talked with and what was said.  As time goes by, you will

want to add other information to your file, such as:</P>



<P>     -    Letters and notes (from doctors, therapists, etc.);<BR>

     -    Medical records and reports;<BR>

     -    Results of tests and evaluations;<BR>

     -    Notes from meetings about your child;<BR>

     -    Therapist(s') reports;<BR>

     -    IFSP and IEP records;<BR>

     -    Your child's developmental history, including personal

notes or diaries on your child's development;<BR>

     -    Records of shots and vaccinations; and<BR>

     -    Family medical histories.</P>



<P>Make sure you get copies of all written information about your

child (records, reports, etc.).  This will help you become an

important coordinator of services and a better advocate for your

child.  Remember, as time goes on, you'll probably have more

information to keep track of, so it's a good idea to keep it

together in one place.</P>

<a name="Q1"></a>
<P><H3>1) Where do I begin if I believe my child needs special education services?</H3></P>

<P>Begin by asking questions and developing a better understanding of the <I>Individuals with Disabilities Education Act </I>(IDEA), Public Law 102-119. This law guarantees a free appropriate public education to children with disabilities. The tips and suggestions on the following pages will help you obtain special education and related services for your child.</P>

<P>You may also want to talk to parents of children who are already receiving special education services. Local parent organizations can assist you. For information about parent groups or statewide disability organizations, check the enclosed NICHCY<I> State Resource Sheet</I> for your state.</P>
<a href="#index">Return to Index</a>
<hr>

<a name="Q2"></a>
<P><H3>2) What are the purposes of the IDEA?</H3></P>

<P>The major purposes of the IDEA are to: (1) guarantee the availability of special education programs to eligible children and youth with disabilities; (2) assure that decisions made about providing special education to children and youth with disabilities are fair and appropriate; and (3) financially assist the efforts of state and local governments to educate children with special needs through the use of Federal funds. </P>
<a href="#index">Return to Index</a>
<hr>

<a name="Q3"></a>
<P><H3>3) Are services available to very young children?</H3></P>

<P>Services to very young children are also covered under the IDEA. Through Part H, the Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities, states may make early intervention services available to eligible infants and toddlers (birth through two years). Under the IDEA, states must provide special education and related services to eligible preschool children (ages 3-5).</P>

<P>Services for these young children are provided in different ways than are services for school-aged children. For more information about early intervention and preschool programs, contact NICHCY for a copy of <I>Accessing Programs for Infants, Toddlers, and Preschoolers with Disabilities: Parent's Guide</I>.</P>

<a name="Q4"></a>
<P><H3>4) What is the first step toward obtaining special education services?</H3></P>

<P>The first step is to arrange for your child to receive an evaluation. The term "evaluation" refers to the total process of gathering and using information to determine whether a child has a disability and the nature and extent of the special education and related services that the child needs. The public schools are required to conduct this evaluation of your child at no cost to you.</P>
<a href="#index">Return to Index</a>
<hr>

<a name="Q5"></a>
<P><H3>5) What is included in an evaluation?</H3></P>

<P>The evaluation process should look at the "whole child" and include information about your child's total environment. Tests are an important part of an evaluation, but the family's input is also important. Additionally, the evaluation process should include:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> observations by professionals who have worked with your child;<BR><BR>

	<LI> your child's medical history, when it is relevant to his or her performance in school;<BR><BR>

	<LI> information and observations from the family about your child's school experiences, abilities, needs, and behavior outside of school, and his or her feelings about school.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>A multidisciplinary team should be involved in performing the evaluation. The team conducting the evaluation may include the following professionals, as appropriate:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> school psychologist;<BR><BR>

	<LI> speech and language pathologist;<BR><BR>

	<LI> occupational therapist;<BR><BR>

	<LI> physical therapist and/or adaptive physical education therapist; <BR><BR>

	<LI>medical specialist(s); <BR><BR>

	<LI>educational diagnostician(s); <BR><BR>

	<LI>classroom teacher(s); and <BR><BR>

	<LI>others.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P><I><B>Professionals will observe your child and may administer tests and use other procedures such as interviews</B></I> that examine your child's: </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>speech and language functioning;<BR><BR>

	<LI>personality and adaptive behavior patterns; academic achievement;<BR><BR>

	<LI> potential or aptitude (intelligence);<BR><BR>

	<LI> functioning levels;<BR><BR>

	<LI> perceptual ability; and<BR><BR>

	<LI> vocational interest and aptitude.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>All tests and interviews must be conducted individually in your child's primary language. The tests must also be given in a way that does not discriminate on the basis of disability or racial/cultural background.</P>

<P>The law states that schools may not place children into special education programs based on the results of only one test. Many tests are needed to measure areas that might be problematic. However, the law does not mention the specific tests to be used. There are many tests that measure the same thing. A specialist may choose to use a certain test as long as the test is considered to be nondiscriminatory and measures what the specialist says it will measure. For detailed information about the evaluation process, contact NICHCY and request a free copy of <I>Assessing Children for the Presence of a Disability</I>.</P>
<a href="#index">Return to Index</a>
<hr>

<a name="Q6"></a>
<P><H3>6) How can my child receive an evaluation?</H3></P>

<P>There are at least three ways in which your child may be selected to receive an evaluation:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> <I>You can request an evaluation</I>. You can call or write the Director of Special Education or the principal of your child's school. If the school refuses to evaluate your child, you must be given a written notice that explains the reasons for refusal. This notice must also give you a full explanation of your rights under the IDEA. It is very important that you keep a copy of this letter, as well as all other correspondence that you have received or sent concerning your child.<BR><BR>
	<LI> <I>The school may ask permission to evaluate your child</I>. A school may recommend a child for evaluation based on observations or results from tests given to all children in a grade. If your child is thought to need further testing, the school must tell you. You, as a parent, must give written permission before the school can evaluate your child.<BR><BR>

	<LI> <I>A teacher or doctor may suggest that your child he evaluated</I>. Your child's teacher may recommend that your child have an evaluation. Again, you must give permission in writing before the school can conduct the evaluation.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>Some schools will be able to conduct a child's entire evaluation within the school. Other schools may not have sufficient personnel to conduct all of the testing needed and will have to contract with outside persons or agencies to conduct some or all of the testing. If your child is evaluated by a specialist outside of the school, the school must make the arrangements and will state in writing exactly what type of testing is to be conducted. All of the evaluation procedures arranged for or conducted by the school system are to be done at no cost to you.</P>

<P>In some cases, once the evaluation has begun, the outside specialist may recommend further testing. Because this additional testing will go beyond what the school originally requested, it is important that the school be contacted to agree to any additional testing and any additional costs which may be incurred.</P>

<P>Here are two more considerations to keep in mind: (1) It is generally a good idea to ask any professional working with or evaluating your child about his or her credentials and prior experience working with children like yours; (2) If, for any reason, you will be having your child retested, be aware that when the same tests are repeated in a short time period, the validity of the results will be seriously weakened. Be sure to talk to all evaluators about any previous testing that has taken place.</P>
<a href="#index">Return to Index</a>
<hr>

<a name="Q7"></a>
<P><H3>7) What is done with the results of my child's evaluation?</H3></P>

<P>Information gathered from the evaluation procedures will be used to determine whether or not your child is eligible for special education and related services. If your child is found to be eligible, the evaluation results will form the basis for developing your child's Individualized Education Program (IEP).</P>
<a href="#index">Return to Index</a>
<hr>

<a name="Q8"></a>
<P><H3>8) What is an Individualized Education Program?</H3></P>

<P><I><B>An Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a written statement of the educational program designed to meet a child's special needs. </B></I>Your child's IEP should include statements of your child's strengths and weaknesses and should describe the instructional program developed specifically for your child. The IEP has two purposes: (1) to establish the learning goals for your child: and (2) to state the services that the school district will provide for your child.</P>

<P>The IDEA requires that every child receiving special education services have an IEP, that parents be included in the development of this IEP, and that the child's parents are entitled to receive their own copy of the IEP (upon request) in order to keep track of progress and to maintain home records.</P>

<P><H3>9) Who develops my child's IEP?</H3></P>

<P>The IEP should be developed at the IEP meeting, by the following participants:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Your child's teacher(s): If your child has more than one teacher, your state may specify in its law which teacher(s) should participate;<BR><BR>

	<LI>A representative of the public agency (school system) other than your child's teacher;<BR><BR>

	<LI>You, the parents, one or both;<BR><BR>

	<LI>Your child, when appropriate; and<BR><BR>

	<LI>Other individuals, at your discretion or at the discretion of your child's school.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<a name="Q10"></a>
<H3>10) What type of information is included in an IEP?</H3>

<P>According to the law, an IEP must include the following statements regarding your child:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> His or her present level of educational performance, which could include information concerning: academic achievement, social <BR>adaptation, prevocational and vocational skills, sensory and motor <BR>skills, self-help skills, and speech and language skills;<BR><BR>

	<LI>Specific special education and related services to be provided and who will provide them;<BR><BR>

	<LI>Dates for when the services will begin and how long they will continue;<BR><BR><BR>

	<LI>Percentage of the school day in which your child will participate in regular education and special education programs;<BR><BR>

	<LI>Annual goals;<BR><BR>

	<LI>Short-term instructional objectives (individual steps which make up the goals);<BR><BR>

	<LI>Transition plan, when applicable; and<BR><BR>

	<LI>Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures to be used to measure your child's progress toward these goals on at least an annual basis.<BR><BR>

<P><H3>11) Is it the school's responsibility to ensure that my child reaches all the goals in his or her IEP?</H3></P>

<P>No. The IEP sets out the individualized instruction to be provided to your child, but it is not a contract. The school is responsible for providing the instructional services listed in an IEP.</P>
<a href="#index">Return to Index</a>
<hr>

<a name="Q12"></a>
<P><H3>12) When is the IEP meeting held and may I attend?</H3></P>

<P><B><I>The law is very clear that parents have the right to participate in the meeting where their child's IEP is developed.</I></B> The school staff will try to schedule the IEP meeting at a time that is convenient for parents (and other team members) to attend. If the school suggests a time that makes it impossible for you to attend, explain your schedule and needs to the person who is making the arrangements. Often, an alternative time or date can be arranged. However, if no mutually agreeable time can be set, the school may hold the IEP meeting without you. In this event, the school must keep you informed by telephone or mail.</P>

<P>The law makes provisions for the changing needs and growth of children. At least once a year, whether you request it or not, a meeting must be scheduled with you to review your child's progress and to develop your child's next IEP. A full reevaluation must be conducted every three years. A reevaluation may occur more frequently if you or your child's teacher(s) request it.</P>

<P><H3>13) What should I do before an IEP meeting?</H3></P>

<P>The IEP meeting is scheduled for the purpose of developing your child's Individualized Education Program. You can prepare for this meeting by looking realistically at your child's strengths and weaknesses, talking to teachers and/or therapists, visiting your child's class or other classes which may be appropriate for him or her, and talking to your child about his or her feelings about school. It is a good idea to write down what you feel your child will be able to accomplish during the school year. It also helps to make notes about what you would like to say during the meeting.</P>
<a href="#index">Return to Index</a>

<a name="Q14"></a>
<P><H3>14) What occurs during an IEP meeting?</H3></P>

<P>The IEP meeting takes place after the specialists have tested your child and recorded the test results. In most cases, the school will have held a meeting to look at your child's test results and determine whether or not he or she is eligible for services. You may or may not have been invited to attend the eligibility meeting. If you were not at the eligibility meeting, then the results of the tests will usually be discussed with you at the IEP meeting. The specialists who evaluated your child will explain what they did, why they used the tests they administered, the results of your child's tests, and what your child's scores mean.</P>

<P>As you listen to the results of the tests (either eligibility tests or measures of progress), make sure that you understand what the tests are meant to measure and how the performance of your child compares to other children who are the same age. Take notes on what you hear, and ask questions if you do not understand.</P>

<P>During the IEP meeting, you will be asked to share the special things you know about your child, including how your child behaves and gets along with others outside of school. You will also be asked about your child's school experiences and personal life. After this discussion, everyone involved will have a better idea of your child's needs. This will allow the team to discuss and determine:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> what educational goals and objectives are appropriate for your child;<BR><BR>

	<LI>what type of special education your child needs;<BR><BR>

	<LI>which related services are necessary to ensure your child benefits from his or her special education;<BR><BR>

	<LI>what assistive technology devices or services your child needs to benefit from special education; and<BR><BR>

	<LI> what placement alternatives exist, and which is most appropriate for your child.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P><B>As a parent, you should understand why the school proposes certain special education services and/or related services (such as therapy) for your child, and you should be comfortable with these ideas before listing them in the IEP. </B>If you hear something about your child which is surprising to you, or different from the way you perceive your child, you will want to bring this to the attention of the other members of the team. In order to design the most appropriate program for your child, it is important to work closely with the other team members and share your feelings about your child's educational needs.</P>

<P>Before you sign the IEP, ask any questions you have, so you are sure you understand what is being said. Signing the IEP means that you agree to the services, goals, and other matters listed in the IEP.</P>

<P>It is helpful to remember that the IEP can be changed. If you are unsure about some of the ideas being presented, set a date for evaluating progress and a time to get together again to discuss the results of the evaluation. <B><I>You may request a review or revision of the  IEP at any time.</I></B></P>
<a href="#index">Return to Index</a>
<hr>

<a name="Q15"></a>
<P><H3>15) What if I disagree with the school about what is appropriate for my child?</H3></P>

<P>It is important to know that before the school system can place your child in a special education program <I>for the first time</I>, you, as parents, must give your written consent. School districts can only override your lack of consent through the use of certain procedures specified in federal and/or state law.</P>

<P>Even if your child has been receiving special education services for some time, you have the right to disagree with the school's decisions concerning new IEPs or educational placements for your child. If you do not agree with what has been proposed in your child's IEP, then you should not sign the IEP.</P>

<P>However, in all cases where family and school disagree, it is important for both sides to be able to discuss their concerns and come to a compromise, at least temporarily. It is usually possible to agree on a particular plan of instruction or classroom placement and then establish a time frame for trying this out. At the end of the prearranged time, agree on a time for (and the type of) evaluation to be conducted to measure progress. Set a time to meet again to discuss the results of the evaluation and decide what to do next. The trial period may be very helpful in coming to a comfortable agreement on how to help your child, and it allows everyone involved to be part of the decision-making process.</P>

<P><H3>16) How can I get services for my child increased?</H3></P>

<P>Suppose your child gets speech therapy two times a week, and you think he or she needs therapy three times a week. What do you do?</P>

<P>First, you can talk with your child's speech pathologist and request an IEP review meeting with the purpose of increasing speech therapy. Discuss your child's needs and ask to see the evaluation of his or her progress. If your child is not making progress with the current schedule, talk to the IEP team about the need for making changes in the IEP. The school personnel will either agree with you and change the IEP, or they will disagree with you.</P>

<P>With any disagreement, you can appeal the decision of the IEP team. You may wish to seek advice from the Parent Information and Training Project in your state; it is listed on the NICHCY <I>State Resource Sheet</I>. Appealing a decision can mean bringing in a third party to mediate your concerns, or it may mean requesting a due process hearing. Your local department of special education can provide you with your state's guidelines for providing services in your state and for appealing decisions. If this is not available locally, contact the state department to request a copy; their address and phone number are also listed on the NICHCY <I>State Resource Sheet</I>.</P>

<P><H3>17) How can I support my child's learning?</H3></P>

<P>Here are some suggestions that can help you support your child's learning and maintain a good working relationship with school professionals:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> Let your child's teacher(s) know that you are interested in playing an active part in your child's educational program. Plan and schedule times to talk with the teacher(s) and, if possible, visit the classroom.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Offer to explain any special equipment, medication, or medical problem your child has.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Inform the teacher(s) of any activities or significant events that may influence your child's performance in school.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Ask that samples of your child's work be sent home. If you have questions, make an appointment with the teacher(s) to discuss new strategies for meeting your child's goals.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Ask for suggestions of how you can continue, expand, and reinforce your child's school activities at home.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Volunteer to help in the classroom or school. This will give you the opportunity to see how things work in the school and how your child interacts with others.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Let the school know that you may be contacted if you are needed.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Remember that you and the school want success for your child. Working together can make this happen.<BR><BR>

School signs often seem   unwelcoming. Schools should make every effort to reach out and   communicate with parents in a clear way and listen to what they have   to say. To ensure that all parents have access to information, written   material should be concise and easily readable. Schools should be   parent-friendly. Some school newsletters for parents include a   glossary of terms to help parents understand school improvement   efforts. Other schools use regularly scheduled telephone calls to stay   in contact with families.</P>   <H3>  Encourage parental participation in school improvement efforts</H3>  <P>   When schools develop improvement plans, families ought to be included   at every stage of the process to get their input and to give them a   sense of shared responsibility. Many schools, supported by the new   Goals 2000: Educate America Act, are now developing such plans. They   are working to raise academic standards, improve teaching, make   schools safer, introduce computers and other learning technologies   into the classroom, and to make many other vitally needed changes. The   full involvement of parents and other members of the community is   instrumental to the success of these efforts.</P>     <H3>Involve parents in decision-making</H3>  <P>   Schools can give parents a more effective voice by opening up the   school governance process so that more parents can participate. Many   schools hold evening and weekend meetings and conferences to   accommodate families' work schedules.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="Give"></a>      <H3>Give teachers the tools to reach out to families</H3>  <P>   Staff development can help teachers to understand the benefits of   family involvement and show them how to remove barriers to   involvement. It can also explain techniques for improving two-way   communication between home and schools, and suggest ways to help meet   families' overall educational needs.</P>     <H3>Make parents feel welcome</H3>  <P>   Often the first time a parent comes to school is when a child is in   trouble. Schools can help reduce tensions by making initial contacts   with parents friendly and respectful. Schools can also reduce distrust   by arranging contacts in neutral settings off school grounds. Home   visits by family liaison personnel can be particularly helpful. Some   programs have used home-school coordinators to run weekly clubs for   parents, helping to build parenting skills and trust between families   and schools. Schools might also encourage parents, teachers, and   students to meet at the beginning of the school year to agree on goals   and develop a common understanding.</P>     <H3>Overcome language barriers</H3>  <P>   Reaching families whose first language is not English requires schools   to make special accommodations. Translating materials into a parent's   first language helps, but written communication alone is not enough.   Ideally, a resource person, perhaps another parent, should be   available to communicate with parent communicate with parents in their   first language. Interactive telephone voice-mail systems that have   bilingual recordings for families are also useful. In addition,   English-as-a-second-language classes for parents and grandparents may   be helpful.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="Use"></a>     <H3>Use technology to link parents to the classroom</H3>  <P>   Educators can creatively use new technology from voice-mail to homework   hotlines to educational CD-ROM programs to get parents more involved   in the learning process. For example, voice mail systems have been   installed in several hundred schools across the country. Parents and   students can call for taped messages that describe classroom   activities and daily homework assignments. Audiotapes and videotapes   can also be used to enhance communication with parents. These are   especially helpful in reaching family members who do not read. Even   with all the new technology, teachers and other school staff can still   use the old telephone to connect with parents. Schools can help by   providing teachers with classroom phones.</P>     <H3>Encourage communities to join school-family partnerships</H3>  <P>   This can be especially effective in reducing schools safety problems   that are connected to problems in surrounding neighborhoods. Parents,   community residents, and law enforcement officials can help by joining   together in voluntary organizations, friendship networks, and   neighborhood watches to solve common problems. Schools and community   and religious organizations can help by offering after-school cultural   and recreational activities. Community-supported student services   have also succeeded when families, schools, and community   representatives have made the effort to get involved.</P>   <P><CENTER>      ______________________________________________________________</CENTER></P>                                                     <CENTER>The Family Involvement National Education Goal</CENTER>                                           <BLOCKQUOTE>"We believe that strengthening the connection between familiesand     schools is so important that we have made it one of America's     National Education Goals.

They're discovering that   school-family partnerships are important way to help children learn   and a great way for schools and families to help each other.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="School"></a>     <H3>School-family partnerships: Enjoying the benefits, overcoming thebarriers</H3>  <P>   Despite the many advantages of partnerships, schools and families   remain disconnected in too many communities. There are many reasons   why schools and families fail to join forces. Sometimes parents say   they don't feel welcome at school. Often, work schedules and other   time constraints, language barriers, or the sheer drag of daily life   get in the way. And sometimes parents who didn't like school when they   were students are reluctant to get involved again as adults.</P>   <P>   On the other side of the coin, too many schools don't put out the   welcome mat for their students' families or simply overlook the great   value of getting families involved. Here's what can be done:</P>      <UL>     <LI> <B>Schools can encourage and support greater family involvement in       education</B>. Research shows that when families take an active,       direct role in their children's education, children get better       grades and test scores, graduate from high school at higher rates,       and have greater enrollment in higher education.  It has also has beenshown to       improve teacher morale and job satisfaction.            <LI> <B>Schools should be places where families feel welcome andvalued</B>.       School programs that encourage greater parental involvement are       more important that any other factor in determining whether or not       parents actually do get involved. Some schools make a special       effort to help low-income families get involved because many of       these families wait for the school to approach them.            <LI> <B>Parents and families can support their schools and play their       part at home</B>. Parental involvement can take many forms, including       getting involved in PTA activities; discussing children's progress       with teachers on a regular basis; checking homework every night;       reading to preschoolers; encouraging students to take the       challenging courses.     </UL>       <P><CENTER>      ______________________________________________________________</CENTER></P>                     <BLOCKQUOTE>"Parent who know their children's                    teachers and help with the homework                  and teach their kids right from wrong --                these parents can make all the difference."</BLOCKQUOTE>   <BR>                                   <P>   <CENTER>President Bill Clinton<BR>   State of the Union Address</CENTER></P>   <a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr>                                              <h3><a name="credits"> Credits </a></h3>                                        <H4> Please Join Us!</H4>   <P>     Greater family involvement in education is supported by the Family     Involvement Partnership for Learning, which includes over 100     education, business, family, community, and religious organizations     nationwide.</P>     <P>     Your school is cordially invited to join the Family involvement     Partnership.

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Your Community Can Do To Support Schools And Family Involvement In
Education</H3>

<P>  <B>Combat alcohol, drugs, and violence</B>
 </P>
<P>   These problems threaten children's chances for success in far too many
   of our communities. Prevention programs work best when parents,
   students, schools, law enforcement officials, and communities join
   together to fight back. For example, schools and community members can
   provide mentoring and after-school programs to give children safe
   havens from violence and alternatives to drugs. Communities can also
   put students on the right path by providing a quality education and
   school-to-work programs that lead to college, technical training, or
   good jobs after high school.  A future filled with hope and promise is
   the best answer to the hopelessness of drugs.  Solving drug and safety
   problems is a difficult task, and each community will have to find its
   own answers. But when communities unite, real progress can be made.</P>

<P>  <B>Teach parenting skills</B>
 </P>
<P>   Programs for parents can include academic classes, literacy training,
   career preparation, early childhood education, children's health, and
   assistance in finding helpful services in the community. When adults
   become involved in parenting education, parent-child communication
   improves and children with developmental delays in speech, social
   skills, and other areas overcome these challenges more readily.
   High-quality parenting programs engage parents early, sometimes even
   before their child's birth, and focus on the critical early years of a
   child's development.</P>

<P>   A recent study of family literacy found that economically at-risk
   preschool children whose parents received significant amounts of
   parenting education performed better on vocabulary test -- an
   important measure of literacy -- than children whose parents received
   little parenting instruction.
  </P>
<P>  <B>Provide mentor programs</B>
 </P>
<P>   Changes in families and communities have limited the amount of contact
   many youths have with adults who can offer advice and act as role
   models. To help fill in the gap, interested citizens -- from employers
   to college students to senior citizens -- can participate in mentor
   programs which can provide emotional support and guidance to young
   people. Mentors can help with schoolwork, job skill development,
   career planning, parenting, and the many other challenges that face
   young people today.
  </P>
<P> <B> Enlist community volunteers</B>
 </P>
<P>   Many different kinds of community organizations, such as civic groups,
   men's and women's associations, service clubs, and religious groups
   can organize support for youngsters. In many communities, senior
   citizens are putting their experience and expertise to work on behalf
   of children. Nearly 40 percent of Americans over 60 years of age are
   now involved in some type of volunteer activity. Volunteers can serve
   as tutors or teacher aides, work in the library, or help with
   after-school activities, such as music and story telling. In one
   school, grandparents served on patrol and as school guards to help
   keep kids safe.  </P>

<P>  <B>Offer summer learning programs</B> </P>

<P>   Communities can make summer activities available to young people
   through schools, cultural institutions, park districts, and other
   public and private agencies. Activities might include programs at
   recreation centers, science and art museums, libraries, and camping
   sites. These programs are particularly important for low-income
   children. With limited access to such learning resources at home as
   books and computers, low-income children can suffer serious academic
   losses over the summer. Those months need not become a time for losing
   ground academically or getting into trouble. With the help of
   community resources, it can be a time of productive learning.  </P>

<P>  <B>Support preschool programs</B> </P>

<P>   Two examples of community programs that support family involvement are
   Parents as Teachers (PAT) and Home Instruction Program for Preschool
   Youngsters (HIPPY). Missouri's Parents as Teachers program operates in
   every district of the state and works with parents of children up to 3
   years of age. HIPPY is for mothers of children aged 4 and 5, and it
   offers a curriculum and materials to help moms get their children
   ready for kindergarten. Local parent aides visit families to explain
   the program and review lessons. PAT and HIPPY have been found to
   improve children's achievement and adjustment to school.</P>

<a name="Supporting"></a>
       <H3> Supporting Family Involvement In Education Makes Good Sense</H3>

<P>     Encouraging family involvement is a good way to enhance your
     community's financial investment in education. If all parents of
     children ages 1 through 9 spent just one hour a day, five days a
     week, reading with their children or helping with schoolwork, the
     total number of learning hours would be in the thousands, maybe
     even millions. The total dollar value of all that teaching is
     enormous -- and the value of our children is incalculable.</P>

<a name="Communities"></a>
<H3>Communities That Support Schools And Families Are Better Places To
Live, Work, And Learn</H3>

<P>   All across America, communities are pulling together to strengthen
   education because they know it's the key to a strong local economy, a
   good quality of life, and a brighter future for everyone.
  </P>
<P>   For communities, making education better means supporting families and
   schools. Families are responsible for raising children, of course, and
   schools are responsible for teaching children. But in these difficult
   times, schools and parents often can't do the job alone, try as they
   might. They need to reach out for the help of neighbors and others in
   their community.
  </P>
<P>   That's where service organizations and agencies, religious groups,
   volunteer groups, clubs, community leaders, and caring citizens can
   help build a true " community partnership for learning"  -- and make
   their community a better place to live, work, and learn.</P>

 <B> How to build your community partnership for learning</B>

<P>   Here's what your community can do:
  </P>
<P>     * Support greater family involvement in education.  Parents and
       families can't sit on the sidelines when it comes to their
       children's education. They need to be personally involved, every
       day. Parents need to read with children, help with homework, stay
       in touch with teachers, and participate in school activities.
      </P>
<P>   Research shows that when parents do get more involved, their children
   get better grades and test scores, graduate from high school at higher
   rates, have greater enrollment in higher education, and are better
   behaved. In all these ways, family involvement in education helps
   children to grow up to be productive, responsible members of the
   community. 
  </P>
<P>     * Support schools. Community members can serve as mentors and
       volunteers in school. In addition, communities can offer after-
       school, summer learning, and recreation programs; locate library
       and cultural services near to schools; make neighborhoods safer
       and drug-free; encourage the development of business-school
       partnerships to create school-to-work programs; support schools'
       efforts to develop challenging academic standards; and work to
       improve education in many other ways.</P>

<P>   These efforts will be rewarded. Communities that have good schools and
   better educated residents are almost always safer, more stable
   communities where businesses and families thrive. And these
   communities can be magnets for new businesses and jobs.
  </P>
<P>  Children: 20% of our population, 100% of our future
 </P>
<P>   Support the effort to help children learn. Find out what resources are
   available in your community for young people and help expand them. Get
   personally involved as a volunteer. For more information about these
   and other ways you and your neighbors can help support and connect
   schools and families, just turn the page.</P>

<P>Young gifted people between the ages of 11 and 15 frequently report a
range of problems as a result of their abundant gifts: perfectionism,
competitiveness, unrealistic appraisal of their gifts, rejection from
peers, confusion due to mixed messages about their talents, and
parental and social pressures to achieve, as well as problems with
unchallenging school programs or increased expectations. Some
encounter difficulties in finding and choosing friends, a course of
study, and, eventually, a career. The developmental issues that all
adolescents encounter exist also for gifted students, yet they are
further complicated by the special needs and characteristics of being
gifted. Once counselors and parents are aware of these obstacles, they
seem better able to understand and support gifted adolescents. Caring
adults can assist these young people to "own" and develop their
talents by understanding and responding to adjustment challenges and
coping strategies.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<a name="Challenges"></a>
<H3>Challenges To Adjustment</H3>

<P>Several dynamics of giftedness continually interfere with adjustment
gains during adolescence. Buescher (1986) has found that, during the
early years of adolescence, gifted young people encounter several
potent obstacles, singly or in combination.</P>

<P><B>Ownership:</B>  Talented adolescents simultaneously "own" and yet question
the validity and reality of the abilities they possess. Some
researchers (Olszewski, Kulieke, &amp; Willis, 1987) have identified
patterns of disbelief, doubt, and lack of self-esteem among older
students and adults:  the so-called "impostor syndrome" described by
many talented individuals. While talents have been recognized in many
cases at an early age, doubts about the accuracy of identification and
the objectivity of parents or favorite teachers linger (Delisle &amp;
Galbraith, 1987; Galbraith, 1983). The power of peer pressure toward
conformity, coupled with any adolescent's wavering sense of being
predictable or intact, can lead to the denial of even the most
outstanding ability. The conflict that ensues, whether mild or acute,
needs to be resolved by gaining a more mature "ownership" and
responsibility for the identified talent.</P>

<P>A second basic pressure often experienced by gifted students is that,
since they have been given gifts in abundance, they feel they must
give of themselves in abundance. Often it is subtly implied that their
abilities belong to parents, teachers, and society.</P>

<P><B>Dissonance:</B>  By their own admission, talented adolescents often feel
like perfectionists. They have learned to set their standards high, to
expect to do more and be more than their abilities might allow.
Childhood desires to do demanding tasks PERFECTLY become compounded
during adolescence. It is not uncommon for talented adolescents to
experience real dissonance between what is actually done and how well
they expected  it to be accomplished. Often the dissonance perceived
by young people is far greater than most parents or teachers realize.</P>

<P><B>Taking Risks:</B>  While risk taking has been used to characterize younger
gifted and talented children, it ironically decreases with age, so
that the bright adolescent is much less likely  to take chances than
others. Why the shift in risk-taking behaviors? Gifted adolescents
appear to be more aware of the repercussions of certain activities,
whether these are positive or negative. They have learned to measure
the decided advantages and disadvantages of numerous opportunities and
to weigh alternatives. Yet their feigned agility at this too often
leads them to reject even those acceptable activities that carry some
risk (e.g., advanced placement courses, stiff competitions, public
presentations), for which high success is less predictable and lower
standards of performance less acceptable in their eyes. One other
possible cause for less risk taking could be the need to maintain
control--to remain in spheres of influence where challenging
relationships, demanding coursework and teachers, or intense
competition cannot enter without absolute personal control.</P>

<P><B>Competing Expectations:</B>  Adolescents are vulnerable to criticism,
suggestions, and emotional appeals from others. Parents, friends,
siblings, and teachers are all eager to add their own expectations and
observations to even the brightest students' intentions and goals.
Often, others' expectations for talented young people compete with
their own dreams and plans. Delisle (1985), in particular, has pointed
out that the "pull" of an adolescent's own expectations must swim
against the strong current posed by the "push" of others' desires and
demands. The dilemma is complicated by the numerous options within the
reach of a highly talented student:  The greater the talent, the
greater the expectations and outside interference.</P>

<P>Gifted adolescents consistently report dramatic episodes of being
pushed to the point of doubt and despair by insensitive teachers,
peers, and even parents. Teachers in secondary schools, in particular,
have tried to disprove the talents of individual students, saying, in
effect, "Prove to me you are as gifted as you think you are."  Coping
with the vagaries of adolescence while also proving oneself again and
again in the classroom or peer group significantly drains energy
allocated for the normal tasks of adjustment and leads to frequent
frustration and isolation.</P>

<P><B>Impatience: </B> Like most other adolescents, gifted students can be
impatient in many ways:  eager to find solutions for difficult
questions, anxious to develop satisfying friendships, and prone to
selecting difficult but immediate alternatives for complex decisions.
The predisposition for impulsive decision making, coupled with
exceptional talent, can make young adolescents particularly intolerant
of ambiguous, unresolved situations. Their impatience with a lack of
clear-cut answers, options, or decisions drives them to seek answers
where none readily exist, relying on an informing, though immature,
sense of wisdom. The anger and disappointment when hasty resolutions
fail can be difficult to surmount, particularly when less capable
peers gloat about these failures.</P>

<P><B>Premature Identity: </B> It appears that the weight of competing
expectations, low tolerance for ambiguity, and the pressure of
multiple potentials each feed very early attempts to achieve an
adultlike identity, a stage normally achieved after the age of 21.
This can create a serious problem for talented adolescents. They seem
to reach out prematurely for career choices that will short-cut the
normal process of identity crisis and resolution.</P>

<H3>Coping Strategies</H3>

<P>How can talented adolescents cope with the myriad obstacles to
developing their talents? A study of young adolescents who
participated in a talent search program Buescher &amp; Higham (1985)
suggested various strategies. Table 1 depicts the strategies suggested
by the adolescents, arranged according to  their assessment of
acceptablity for use.</P>

<P>Table 1. Coping Strategies Suggested by Adolescents (In Order by
Weighted Ranking; 0 = Least Acceptable to Students; 10 = Most
Acceptable):</P>

<blockquote>
	(0) Pretend not to know as much as you do.<BR><BR>

	(1) Act like a "brain" so peers leave you alone.<BR><BR>
	 
	(2) Adjust language and behavior to disguise true abilities from your peers.<BR><BR>
	 
	(3) Avoid programs designed for gifted/talented students.<BR><BR>
	 
	(4) Be more active in community groups where age is no object.<BR><BR>
	 
	(5) Develop/excel in talent areas outside school setting.<BR><BR>
	 
	(6) Achieve in areas at school outside academics.<BR><BR>
	 
	(7) Build more relationships with adults.<BR><BR>
 
	(8) Select programs and classes designed for gifted/talented students.<BR><BR>
	 
	(9) Make friends with other students with exceptional talents.<BR><BR>
	 
	(10) Accept and use abilities to help peers do better in classes.<BR><BR>
</blockquote>

<P>The strategies were influenced by such factors as age, sex, and
participation in programs for gifted students. For example, over the
course of 4 years (ages 11 to 15), "using one's talent to help others"
moved from second place to first, by way of third. "Achieving in
school in areas outside academics" appeared to rise in popularity
until the age of 14 but then dropped to third place. Students
participating in special programs for the gifted were less likely, as
they grew older, to mask their true abilities. Other studies have
indicated that gifted females appear to be somewhat vulnerable to the
pull of cultural expectations that drive them toward seeking peer
acceptance rather than leadership and the full development of their
abilities (Olszewski-Kubilius &amp; Kulieke, 1989).</P>

<P>Versions of the following conversation can often be heard when 
young gifted children start school.  "Bill doesn't belong in kindergarten!" the parent cries.  "Look, he's reading at the fourth-grade 
level and has already learned two-column addition."  The teacher 
or principal, having already decided this is a 'pushy parent,' 
replies, "Well, Mrs. Smith, Bill certainly doesn't belong in first 
grade; he hasn't learned to tie his shoelaces, and he can't hold a 
pencil properly, and he had a tantrum yesterday in the hall."</P>

<P>The problem in this continuing controversy is that both parties are usually correct. Some gifted children entering kindergarten have acquired academic skills far beyond those of their 
age mates.  Such children master the academic content of 
kindergarten when they are 3 years old.  However, their physical 
and social development may be similar to that of other 5-year-olds, making an accelerated placement a mismatch as well.  The 
usual solution is to place a child like Bill in a program matched to 
his weaknesses, rather than to his strengths.  Bill usually ends up 
in kindergarten, where his advanced intellectual development becomes a frustration to his teacher, an embarrassment to his 
peers, and a burden to Bill.  </P>

<P>        Educators justify this placement by saying, "Bill needs socialization; he's already so far ahead academically, he doesn't 
need anything in that area."  There are two major problems with 
this rationale.  First, educators are essentially telling such students that there is no need for them to learn anything in school.  
The second problem is revealed by examining the so called 
"socialization" experienced by a brilliant 5-year-old like Bill in a 
kindergarten class of 25 to 30 students.  A major component of 
early socialization involves a child's feeling that she or he is accepted by others,teachers and children alike.  If the teacher 
does not validate a gifted child's advanced abilities and intellectual interests by making them part of the on going curriculum, the 
child experiences no feelings of acceptance from the teacher.  If, 
as is highly likely, this child makes the additional discovery that 
she or he is quite different from most classmates and that communication is extremely difficult because of differences in vocabulary and modes of expression, then the child misses peer 
acceptance as well.  In fact, this first school experience, which 
should furnish the impetus for future enthusiasm about learning, 
can be a dismal failure for the brilliant child in a lockstep kindergarten program.  Often these children learn to hide or deny their 
abilities, so as to fit in better with the other children.  Or, they may 
develop behavioral problems or psychosomatic symptoms such 
as stomachaches and headaches, causing parents to confront 
the school with justifiable concern.</P>

<a name="Understanding"></a>
<H3>Understanding Uneven Development
</H3>
<P>        It is important to remember that these children very often do 
not develop evenly.  In fact, young gifted children frequently show 
peaks of extraordinary performance rather than equally high skill 
levels in all cognitive areas.  The child who learns to read at age 3 
or who shows unusually advanced spatial reasoning ability, for 
example, may not be the child with the highest IQ or the earliest 
language development.  Unique patterns of development can be 
observed within a group of gifted children, and uneven development is frequently evident in the pattern of a single child.  In some 
cases, it seems as though children's abilities develop in spurts, 
guided by changes in interest and opportunity.  Reading ability, 
for example, might develop almost overnight.  Children who know 
all their letters and letter sounds by age 2 1/2 may remain at that 
level for some time, perhaps until age 4 or 5, and then in a matter 
of months develop fluent reading skills at the third or fourth grade 
level.  </P>

<P>        Another area of unevenness in the development of gifted 
young children is found in the relationship between advanced intellectual development and development of physical and social 
skills.  Evidence seems to indicate that intellectually gifted children's performance in the physical domain may only be advanced 
to the extent that the physical tasks involve cognitive organization.  And, although intellectually advanced children tend to possess some advanced social-cognitive skills, they do not necessarily demonstrate those skills in their social behavior.  In other 
words, they may understand how to solve social conflicts and interact cooperatively, but not know how to translate their understanding into concrete behavior.</P>

<P>        It is not uncommon to find gifted young children experiencing 
a vast gap between their advanced intellectual skills and their 
less advanced physical and emotional competencies.  For example, 4- and 5-year old children may converse intelligently about 
abstract concepts such as time and death and read fluently at the 
fourth-grade level, yet find it difficult to hold a pencil or to share 
their toys with others.  </P>

<P>        Often these uneven developmental levels can lead to extreme frustration, as children find that their limited physical skills 
are not sufficiently developed to carry out the complex projects 
they imagined.  These children may throw tantrums or even give 
up on projects without trying.  Adult guidance in developing coping 
strategies can help such children set more realistic goals for 
themselves and learn how to solve problems effectively when 
their original efforts do not meet their high expectations.</P>
  
<P>        Adults, too, can be misled by children's advanced verbal 
ability or reasoning skill into expecting equally advanced behavior 
in all other areas.  It is unsettling to hold a high-level conversation 
with a 5 year-old who then turns around and punches a classmate 
who stole her pencil.  Sometimes young children's age-appropriate social behavior is interpreted as willful or lazy by parents and 
teachers whose expectations are unrealistically high.  The only 
accurate generalization that can be made about the characteristics of intellectually gifted young children is that they demonstrate 
their unusual intellectual skills in a wide variety of ways and that 
they form an extremely heterogeneous group with respect to interests, skill levels in particular areas, social development, and 
physical abilities.</P>

<P>        Understanding the unique developmental patterns often present in gifted children can help parents, and teachers as well, adjust their expectations of academic performance in young children 
to a more reasonable level.</P>

 <a name="Choosing"></a>
<H3>Choosing a Program or School
</H3>

<P>One of the few psychological truths educators and psychologists 
agree upon states that the most learning occurs when an optimal 
match between the learner's current understanding and the challenge of new learning material has been carefully engineered.  
Choosing a program or school for a gifted child who masters ideas 
and concepts quickly but who behaves like a typical  4- or 5-year-
old is indeed a challenge.  </P>

<P>        Many intellectually gifted children master the cognitive content of most preschool and kindergarten programs quite early.  
They come to school ready and eager to learn concepts not usually taught until an older age.  However, academic tasks designed 
for older children often require the learner to carry out teacher-directed activities while sitting still and concentrating on written 
work sheets.  Young children, no matter how bright they are, require active involvement with learning materials and often do not 
have the writing skills required for above-grade-level work. </P>
 
<P>        Since many gifted children will hide their abilities so as to fit in more closely with classmates in a regular program, teachers may 
not be able to observe advanced intellectual or academic abilities 
directly.  If a kindergartner enters school with fluent reading ability, the parent should share this information at the beginning of 
the year instead of waiting until the end of the year to complain 
that the teacher did not find out that the child could read.  When 
parents and teachers pool their observations of a child's skills, 
they begin to work together to develop appropriate educational 
options for nurturing those abilities.  Parents whose children have 
some unusual characteristics that will affect their learning needs 
have an obligation to share that information with educators, just 
as educators have an obligation to listen carefully to parent concerns.  </P>

<P>        When the entry level of learners is generally high but extremely diverse, an appropriate program must be highly individualized.  Children should be encouraged to progress at their own 
learning rate, which will result in most cases in subject matter acceleration.  The program should be broadly based, with planned 
opportunities for development of social, physical, and cognitive 
skills in the informal atmosphere of an early childhood classroom.</P>

<P>        One primary task of teachers is to make appropriately advanced content accessible to young children, taking into account 
individual social and physical skills.  Lessons can be broken into 
short units, activities presented as games, and many concepts 
taught through inquiry-oriented dialogue and experimentation with 
manipulatable materials.  Language experience activities in reading and the use of manipulatable math materials as described in 
products like Mathematics Their Way  (Baratta-Lorton, 1976), are 
good examples of appropriate curriculum approaches.</P>

<P>        An appropriate learning environment should also offer a gifted 
young child the opportunity to discover true peers at an early age.  
Parents of gifted children frequently find that, while their child can 
get along with other children in the neighborhood, an intense 
friendship is likely to develop with a more developmentally equal 
peer met in a special class or interest-based activity.  Such parents may be dismayed to discover that this "best friend" does not 
live next door but across town, and may wonder whether or not to 
give in to their child's pleas for inconvenient visits.  Probably one 
of the most supportive activities a parent can engage in is to help 
a child find a true friend and make the effort required to permit the 
friendship to flower.</P>

<P>        In looking for an appropriate program for their gifted 
preschooler, then, parents must be aware of the learning needs of 
young children and not be misled by so-called experts who advocate rigid academic approaches with an emphasis on rote memorization and repetition.  Rather wise parents will look for open-endedness, flexible grouping, and opportunities for advanced activities in a program that allows their child to learn in the company 
of intellectual peers.</P>

<H3>What is Stress?</H3>

<P>Stress is the body's general response to any intense physical, emotional, or
mental demand placed on it by oneself or others.  While racing to meet a
deadline, dealing with a difficult person, or earning a poor grade are all
stressful, so are the excitement of playing a lively game of tennis, falling in
love, and being selected to join a special program for gifted students.</P>

<H3>How Can a Youngster Experience Stress When Nothing Bad is
Happening?</H3>
<P>Anything can be a stressor if it lasts long enough, happens often enough, is
strong enough, or is perceived as stress.  Working diligently on a project,
performing many simple but boring tasks, or earning an "A" grade when
one expected an "A+" may all be stressful.</P>

<H3>Is a Gifted Student More Likely to Feel Stress than Others?</H3>

<P>Many gifted youngsters have a heightened sensitivity to their
surroundings, to events, to ideas, and to expectations.  Some experience
their own high expectations for achievement as a relentless pressure to
excel.  Constant striving to live up to self-expectations--or those of others--
to be first, best, or both can be very stressful.   With every new course,
new teacher, or new school questions arise about achievement and
performance, since every new situation carries with it the frightening risk
of being mediocre.  Striving becomes even more stressful when unrealistic
or unclear expectations are imposed by adults or peers.  The pressure to
excel, accompanied by other concerns such as feeling different, self-doubt
(the "imposter" syndrome), and the need to prove their giftedness can
drain the energy of gifted students and result in additional stress.</P>

<P>        Stress occurs even when everything is going well.  Youngsters get
tired from their constant efforts and may secretly fear that next time they
will not be as successful.  </P>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Are Some Other Stresses on a Gifted Student?
</H3>
<P>Many gifted students accept responsibility for a variety of activities such
as a demanding courseload; leadership in school activities, clubs, or sports;
and part-time jobs.  Even if it were humanly possible, doing everything
well would be physically and emotionally stressful.</P>

<P>        Vacations may be stressful if students are comfortable only when
achieving and succeeding.  Taking time off may make them feel nervous
and lacking control.  </P>
<P>        Gifted students need intellectual challenge.  Boring, monotonous
busy-work is very stressful for individuals who prefer thinking and
reasoning activities.  Boredom may result in anger, resentment, or, in some
cases, setting personal goals for achievement and success that significantly
exceed those of parents or school.</P>
<P>        Some gifted students value independence and leadership, yet the
separation they feel from their peers results in loneliness and fewer
opportunities to relieve stress.  Finding a peer group can be difficult,
particularly for adolescents.  Some experience a conflict between belonging
to a group and using their extraordinary abilities.  </P>
<P>        Gifted students are complex thinkers, persuasively able to argue
both
sides of any question.  This ability, however, may complicate decisions.
Students may lack information about and experience with resources,
processes, outcomes, or priorities that help tip an argument toward a clear
solution.  Furthermore, not every problem has one obviously correct
answer.  Compromise and accommodation are realities in the adult world,
but they are not easily perceived from a young person's viewpoint.  Thus,
decision making may be a very stressful process.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="How"></a>
<H3>How Can Stress Hurt A Gifted Student's Self-Esteem?</H3>
<P>During the early years, school may be easy, with minimum effort required
for success.  If students are not challenged, they conclude that "giftedness"
means instant learning, comprehension, and mastery, and that outstanding
achievement follows naturally.  As years pass, however, schoolwork
becomes more difficult. Some students discover that they must work
harder to earn top grades and that they have not developed productive
study habits.  Many suspect they are no longer gifted, and their sense of
self-worth is undermined.</P>
<P>        Stress can hamper the very abilities that make these students
gifted.
Stress clouds thinking, reduces concentration, and impairs decision making.
It leads to forgetfulness and a loss of ability to focus keenly on a task, and
it makes students overly sensitive to criticism.  Under these conditions,
they perform less well and are more upset by their failures.</P>

<H3>Gifted Students Have So Much Potential.  How Can That Be
Stressful?</H3>
<P>Abundant gifts and the potential for success in many different subjects
and careers may increase opportunities and lead to complex choices.
Limiting options is a confusing and upsetting process because it means
saying "no" to some attractive alternatives.  A person cannot prepare to
become an architect and a financial planner, or an advertising executive
and a scientist.  At some point, the education needed for one career splits
from that needed for the other.  To set career goals, students must know
themselves well as individuals.  They must understand their own
personalities, values, and goals and use self-awareness as a guide for
making decisions.  These activities are all stressful.</P>

<a name="How Can"></a>
<H3>How Can Gifted Students Cope With Stress?</H3>
<P>Some ways of coping with stress are healthy; others are not.  Some healthy
ways of handling stress include the following:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B>Change the source of the stress.</B>  Do something else for a
while.  Put down
	those study notes and jog for an hour.

	<LI><B>Confront the source of the stress. </B> If it is a person, persuade
him or her to
remove the stress.  Ask the teacher for an extension on a project.  Sit down
with the person driving you crazy and talk about ways you might better
work together.

<LI><B>Talk about the source of stress. </B> Rid yourself of frustration.
Find a good
listener and complain.  Talk through possible solutions.

<LI><B>Shift your perspective. </B> Tell yourself that each new situation
or problem is
a new challenge, and that there is something to be learned from every
experience.  Try to see the humorous side of the situation.

<LI><B>Learn skills and attitudes that make tasks easier and more
successful.  </B>
Practice effective organization and time-management skills.  For example,
large projects are easier and less overwhelming when broken down into
manageable steps.  Learn to type and revise assignments on a word
processor.  Learn about yourself and your priorities, and use the
information to make decisions.  Learn how to say "no" gracefully when
someone offers you another attractive (or unpleasant) task about which
you have a choice.  Tell yourself that this unpleasantness will be over soon
and that the whole process will bring you closer to reaching your goal.
Mark the days that are left on the calendar, and enjoy crossing out each
one as you near the finish.

<LI><B>Take time out for enjoyable activities.   </B> Everyone needs a
support system.
Find friends, teachers, or relatives with whom you have fun.  Spend time
with these people when you can be yourself and set aside the pressures of
school, work, or difficult relationships.   As a reward for your efforts, give
yourself work breaks.  Listen to your favorite music, shoot baskets, or
participate in some other brief activity that is mentally restful or fun.

<LI><B>Ignore the source of the stress.</B>   Practice a little healthy
procrastination
and put a pleasant activity ahead of the stressful one.  This, is, of course,
only a short-term solution.

<LI><B>Get regular physical exercise and practice sound nutrition. </B>
Physical
activity not only provides time out, but also changes your body chemistry
as you burn off muscle tension built up from accommodating stress.
Exercise also increases resistance to illness.  Nutritious food and regular
meals help regulate your body chemistry and keep you functioning at your
sharpest.  Eating healthy and attractively prepared food can be an
enjoyable activity on its own.
</UL>
<P>The following are some unhealthy ways students cope with stress:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><B>Escaping through alcohol, drugs, frequent illness, sleep, overeating, or
starving themselves. </B> These strategies suggest a permanent withdrawal or
avoidance rather than a time out.

<LI><B>Selecting strategies to avoid failure.</B>  Gifted students closely
link their
identities to excellence and achievement.  Failure, or even the perception
of failure, seriously threatens their self-esteem.  By not trying, or by
selecting impossible goals, students can escape having their giftedness
questioned.  Only their lack of effort will be questioned.

<LI><B>Aiming too low.</B>  This reduces stress by eliminating intense
pressure or
possible feelings of failure.  Dogged procrastination in starting projects,
selecting less competitive colleges or less rigorous courses, or dropping out
of school rather than bringing home poor grades allows students to avoid
feelings of failure in the short run.  Sadly, this sets the stage for long-term
disappointment caused by a destructive coping style.

<LI><B>Overscheduling daily life with schoolwork and extracurricular
activities, </B>
selecting impossibly demanding courseloads, or fussing endlessly over
assignments in vain attempts to make them perfect.  With this strategy, it
is possible to succeed only through superhuman effort; thus the student
can save face by setting goals too high for anyone to achieve.<BR><BR>

<a name="How I"></a>
<H3>How Can I Tell Whether Or Not a Gifted Student Is Experiencing
Burnout?</H3>
<P>Not all gifted youngsters are stressed by the same events.  Individual
responses to stress also differ: Younger students do not tend to respond to
stress in the same way that teenagers do.  Since each student is unique,
parents and teachers will have to watch carefully to know whether a child
is stressed to the point of constructive excitement or to the point of
damaging overload.</P>

<P>The following checklist includes many, but not all, symptoms of burnout:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Student is no longer happy or pleasantly excited about school
        	activities, but, rather, is negative or cynical toward
        	work, teachers, classmates, parents, and the whole
        	school- and achievement-centered experience.

<LI>Student approaches most school assignments with
        resignation or resentment.
<LI>Student exhibits boredom.
<LI>Student suffers from sleeplessness, problems in falling asleep,
        or periodic waking.
<LI>Student overreacts to normal concerns or
         events.
<LI>Student experiences fatigue, extreme tiredness, low energy level.
<LI>Student exhibits unhappiness with self and accomplishments.
<LI>Student has nervous habits such as eye blinking, head shaking,
        or stuttering.
<LI>Student has physical ailments such as weekly or daily
        stomachaches or headaches.
<LI>Student is frequently ill.
<LI>Student exhibits dependency through increased clinging
        or needing and demanding constant support and reassurance.
<LI>Student engages in attention-getting behaviors such as
        aggressive or acting-out behaviors.
<LI>Student has a sense of being trapped or a feeling or
        being out of control.
<LI>Student is unable to make decisions.
<LI>Student has lost perspective and sense of humor.
<LI>Student experiences increased feelings of physical,
        emotional, and mental exhaustion in work and activities
        that used to give pleasure.<BR><BR>

<a name="How Parents"></a>
<H3>How Can Parents, Teachers, and Counselors Reduce Stress on
Gifted Students?</H3>
<P>Help each gifted student understand and cope with his or her intellectual,
social, and emotional needs during each stage of development.  In some
ways, the needs of gifted students mirror those of more typical children.
Giftedness, however, adds a special dimension to self-understanding and
self-acceptance.  If gifted youngsters are to develop into self-fulfilled
adults, the following differential needs must be addressed:  (a) the need to
understand the ways in which they are different from others and the ways
in which they are the same; (b) the need to accept their abilities, talents,
and limitations; (c) the need to develop social skills; (d) the need to feel
understood and accepted by others; and (e) the need to develop an
understanding of the distinction between "pursuit of excellence" and
"pursuit of perfection."  VanTassel-Baska (1989) and Delisle (1988) have
offered useful suggestions on how to meet these needs.</P>

<P>Help each gifted student develop a realistic and accurate self-concept.
Giftedness does not mean instant mastery or winning awards.  Parents and
teachers need to set realistic expectations for efforts and achievements and
help the student choose appropriate goals.  It is important to recognize and
appreciate efforts and improvement.  </P>
<P>        On the other hand, giftedness permits people to learn and use
information in unusual ways.  Given parental support and encouragement,
personal motivation, and opportunities to learn and apply their knowledge,
gifted students may enjoy the process of creating new ideas, especially if
they believe that it is all right to think differently than age-mates.</P>

<P>Help each gifted student be a whole person.  Gifted youngsters are children
first and gifted second.  While their learning styles may be special, they
are individuals with emotions, likes and dislikes, and unique personalities.
They will not wake up one day and be "not gifted." They should not feel
responsible for solving world problems, nor does the world owe them
tribute.  It is up to each student to make life meaningful.  Understanding
these realistic limits to the bounty of giftedness can reduce stress on
confused students.</P>
<P>        Gifted students have strong emotions that give personal meaning to
each experience.  Emotions should be recognized, understood, and used as a
valid basis for appropriate behaviors.</P>

<P>Show patience.  Let students select and strive toward their own goals.  Do
not compare them or their achievements to others.
        Some gifted students are intensely curious and may have less
tolerance for ambiguity and unpredictability than their age-mates.  Help
them develop patience with themselves.</P>

<P>Show acceptance and encouragement.  Encourage students to work
purposefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly and do the best they can.  It is
not necessary to excel in every situation.  Help them develop priorities to
decide which tasks require the best efforts and which require simply "good
enough."</P>
<P>        Accept and reward efforts and the process of working on tasks.
Sincere effort is valuable in itself and deserves reinforcement.  The means
may be more deserving of merit than the ends.  Efforts are within the
gifted students' control; the outcomes (high grades, prizes, honors, etc.) are
not.  Show love and acceptance, regardless of the outcome.  These
youngsters need to be cherished as individuals, not simply for their
accomplishments.  They must know that they can go home and be loved--
and continue to love themselves--even when they do not finish first or
best.</P>

<P>Encourage flexibility and appropriate behavior.  Curiosity is frequently
mentioned as a characteristic of gifted learners.  Many individuals agree
that gifted students seem to question rules automatically, asking "How
come?"  Concerned adults can reduce stress on gifted students by helping
them distinguish between hard-and-fast rules that should be followed and
those that can safely be questioned or altered and helping them
understand why rules sometimes change from time to time.</P>
<P>        Many people recognize that new ideas come from reshaping and
discarding old notions of right and wrong and want students to be
inquiring, creative, and resourceful thinkers.  But society, schools, teachers,
and academic subjects have rules.  In our society, flagrant rule breakers
may be penalized and shut out of opportunities for further growth and
enrichment.  Our students will become better thinkers by learning that
rules are man-made guides to behavior, not perfect or divine, but they are
to be learned, understood, and followed appropriately in certain situations.
For instance, not every student will like every teacher, but showing
respect is appropriate behavior even if the student privately thinks
otherwise.  Wise adults can model problem-solving methods that result in
workable solutions and help gifted students learn when and how to use
their novel perceptions, creativity, and independent thoughts
appropriately and effectively.</P>
<P>        Understanding and following rules does not mean conforming to
every situation.  There are some occasions when gifted students should not
be expected to accommodate others.  For example, a severe mismatch
between a youngster's ability level and a school program may be very
stressful.  Altering the student's curriculum may solve the problem.  </P>
<P>        Some parents unintentionally send mixed messages regarding
behavior.  When children are rude or uncooperative and offend teachers,
other adults, or peers, their parents behave as though giftedness somehow
excuses such behavior and the offending actions highlight their child's
specialness.  Some even seem pleased.   These parents do their children a
great disservice by denying them the opportunity to learn empathy,
teamwork, and tolerance for individual differences.  </P>

<P>Let students live their own lives.  Caring adults support, encourage, and
celebrate students' efforts and successes, but they stand back a bit from
these efforts and achievements.  They let students select and master
activities for personal enjoyment.  Unfortunately, some students wonder
whether their efforts and gains are for personal satisfaction or to please
overly involved parents, teachers, or others.  When these students wish to
give up an activity that no longer brings pleasure or interest, they fear
they will disappoint others, and they are likely to feel trapped.</P>

<P>Be available for guidance and advice.  Some gifted students appear to be
more mature than their chronological age indicates.   They have advanced
verbal skills and can talk a good line.  Nevertheless, they are still children
and need realistic, clearly stated guidelines about limits, values, and
proper behavior.  These young people may not have enough information or
experience to make wise and effective decisions.  They may not
understand decision-making processes, and they need wise adults to listen
and guide as they talk through the problem, the alternatives, and the pro's
and con's and try out choices.  Knowing that they can be independent and
still talk through their thoughts with others without losing face reduces
stress for these students.  </P>
<P>        Gifted students need to hear adults openly state some of their
perspectives to understand expectations and acceptable limits.  While
these students are very perceptive, they cannot read minds.</P>
<P>        Gifted students may know more facts about their interest area than
do their parents and other adults.  However, they have not lived longer;
they need loving concern and guidance.</P>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Is Attention  Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?</H3>

<blockquote>
<P>ADHD is a disorder characterized by three behaviors:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
 	<LI>HYPERACTIVITY
 	<LI>DISTRACTIBILITY 
 	<LI>IMPULSIVITY 
</UL>

<P>You may see one or more of these behaviors. It is not necessary to have all three to have ADHD: e.g., one does not have to be hyperactive.</P>

<P>ADHD is related, to but different than, learning disabilities (LD). Some people only have learning disabilities. Some have ADHD only. Some have both. A number of professionals  believe that as many as 50%-80% of those with ADHD will have LD. There is an overlap. It is important to remember each disorder requires different treatment.</P>

<H3>What Are These Three Behaviors?</H3>

<blockquote>
<P><B>Hyperactivity:</B> The child exhibits an unusual degree of activity. Most are fidgety;
something is always in motion - fingers, pencil, feet. They squirm in their seat, or cannot remain seated, etc. </P>

<P><B>Distractibility:</B> The child has difficulty blocking out unnecessary input from the environment.</P>

<P><B>Auditorily  Distractible </B></P>

<P>Means paying attention to all sounds, not just appropriate ones, e.g., voices in  halls, ringing of
telephone.</P>

</blockquote>

<P><B>Visually  Distractible </B></P>
<blockquote>
<P>Means paying attention to all things seen rather than the appropriate items, e.g., clouds, rug,
pictures. </P>

<P><B>Impulsivity:</B> The child does not think before acting or talking and does not consider the impact of his/her actions on others. Thus, they do not learn from experience. This child may be accident prone because of impulsive behavior combined with poor judgment. </P>

<a name="The"></a>
<H3>Who Makes The Diagnosis?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>Parents, teachers, and professionals may find evidence suggesting ADHD. However a physician usually confirms the diagnosis.</P>
</blockquote>
<H3>How Is The Diagnosis Made?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>ADHD is the least common reason for hyperactivity, distractibility or impulsivity. The most common causes for these behaviors are anxiety or depression.</P>

<P>The history of the problem is the best indication. If the behaviors have been chronic, that is, present almost since birth, and pervasive, present all day, every day, it is probably ADHD.</P>

<P>Check list and rating scales can be of assistance. However, the history of the behavior combined with clinical observations remain the best procedure for establishing the diagnosis of ADHD. </P>

<a name="Causes"></a>
<H3>What Causes ADHD?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>The final answer is not known. Current research strongly suggests that ADHD is due to a deficiency in a specific neurotransmitter in the lower area of the brain. Research should lead to a greater understanding of this disorder in coming years.</P>
</blockquote>

<H3>How Long Does It Last?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>Current information suggests about 50% of children with ADHD will no longer have ADHD by puberty. The  remainder will continue into adolescence and possibly into adulthood.</P>
</blockquote>

<H3>How Is ADHD Treated?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>Behavioral approaches can be attempted to help the child concentrate on sitting still, staying on task or thinking before acting. Most of these are effective for short periods of time. </P>

<P>Several nutritional approaches have been proposed. The Feingold Diet appears to work at best for 1-2% of children with ADHD. Too much refined sugar can increase hyperactivity in some children.</P>

<P>The generally accepted treatment in this country is the use of medications.</P>
</blockquote>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Treatment"></a>
<H3>Treatment With Medication:</H3>
<blockquote>
Each medication has its own characteristics, effects and possible side effects. Thus, the physician should review these issues with the parents before beginning any medication. The goal is to decrease or stop the behavior without side effects.

<P>Medications have been used since 1937 and are considered to be safe and effective. These medications do not "drug" or "alter the mind" of the child.  Rather, research suggests that each medication increases the amount of the chemical that is deficient in the brain, allowing the brain to function normally; therefore, the behaviors are diminished. Thus, the child becomes less active, less distractible and more able to think before acting.</P>

<P>The current approach is to use one of three groups of medications. The physician will generally begin with Group One progressing to the others if no improvement is seen or side effects occur.</P>

<P>Since ADHD can interfere with classroom work, peer interactions and family life, it is  recommended that the child be on medication throughout each day, not just during school hours.</P>

<H4>Group One medications are:</H4>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Ritalin (methylpenidate)

	<LI>Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)

	<LI>Cylert (pemoline)	 
</UL>

<H4> Group Two medications are </H4>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Tofranil (imipramine)

	<LI>Noripane (desipramine)
</UL>

 <H4>Group Three medications are:</H4>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
 	<LI>Mellaril (thioridazine)	 

 	<LI>Tegretol (carbamazepine)	 
</UL>


<P>Clonidine may be used with Group One or Two  medications to increase their effectiveness.</P>

 <H3>Remember The Total Child: </H3>
<blockquote>
<P>Many children with ADHD also have learning  disabilities. Treating the ADHD will not treat the learning disabilities. Each must be treated if the child is to make sufficient progress.</P>

<P>If children have ADHD and learning disabilities they may develop emotional, social and family  problems. Each must be recognized and helped. Unless the total child, in his or her total environment is considered, neither the child nor the family will make as much improvement as necessary.</P>

<H3>Definition of Speech and Language Disorders</H3>

<P>     Speech and language disorders refer to problems in
communication and related areas such as oral motor function. 
These delays and disorders range from simple sound substitutions
to the inability to understand or use language or use the
oral-motor mechanism for functional speech and feeding.  Some
causes of speech and language disorders include hearing loss,
neurological disorders, brain injury, mental retardation, drug
abuse, physical impairments such as cleft lip or palate, and
vocal abuse or misuse.  Frequently, however, the cause is
unknown.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Incidence"></a>
<H3> Incidence</H3> 

<P>     One quarter of the students served in the public schools'
special education programs (almost 1 million children in the
1992-93 school year) were categorized as having a speech or
language impairment.  This estimate does not include children who
have speech/language problems secondary to other conditions such
as deafness.  Language disorders may be related to other
disabilities such as mental retardation, autism or cerebral
palsy.  It is estimated that communication disorders (including
speech, language and hearing disorders) affect one of every 10
people in the United States.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
 <H3>Characteristics</H3> 

<P>     A child's communication is considered delayed when the child
is noticeably behind his or her peers in the acquisition of
speech and/or language skills.  Sometimes a child will have
greater receptive (understanding) than expressive (speaking)
language skills, but this is not always the case.  </P>

<P>     Speech disorders refer to difficulties producing speech
sounds or problems with voice quality.  They might be
characterized by an interruption in the flow or rhythm of speech,
such as stuttering, which is called dysfluency.  Speech disorders
may be problems with the way sounds are formed, called
articulation or phonological disorders, or they may be
difficulties with the pitch, volume or quality of the voice. 
There may be a combination of several problems.  People with
speech disorders have trouble using some speech sounds, which can
also be a symptom of a delay.  They may say "see" when they mean
"ski" or they may have trouble using other sounds like "l" or
"r".  Listeners may have trouble understanding what someone with
a speech disorder is trying to say.  People with voice disorders
may have trouble with the way their voices sound.</P>

<P>     A language disorder is an impairment in the ability to
understand and/or use words in context, both verbally and
nonverbally.  Some characteristics of language disorders include
improper use of words and their meanings, inability to express
ideas, inappropriate grammatical patterns, reduced vocabulary and
inability to follow directions.  One or a combination of these
characteristics may occur in children who are affected by
language learning disabilities or developmental language delay. 
Children may hear or see a word but not be able to understand its
meaning.  They may have trouble getting others to understand what
they are trying to communicate.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Educational"></a> 
 <H3>Educational Implications</H3> 

<P>     Because all communication disorders carry the potential to
isolate individuals from their social and educational
surroundings, it is essential to find appropriate timely
intervention.  While many speech and language patterns can be
called "baby talk" and are part of a young child's normal
development, they can become problems if they are not outgrown as
expected.  In this way an initial delay in speech and language or
an initial speech pattern can become a disorder which can cause
difficulties in learning.  Because of the way the brain develops,
it is easier to learn language and communication skills before
the age of 5.  When children have muscular disorders, hearing
problems or developmental delays, their acquisition of speech,
language and related skills is often affected.</P>

<P>     Speech-language pathologists assist children who have
communication disorders in various ways.  They provide individual
therapy for the child; consult with the child's teacher about 
the most effective ways to facilitate the child's communication
in the class setting; and work closely with the family to develop
goals and techniques for effective therapy in class and at home.
Technology can help children whose physical conditions make
communication difficult.  The use of electronic communication
systems allow nonspeaking people and people with severe
physical disabilities to engage in the give and take of shared
thought.</P>

<P>     Vocabulary and concept growth continues during the years
children are in school. Reading and writing are taught and, as
students get older, the understanding and use of language becomes
more complex.  Communication skills are at the heart of the
education experience. Speech and/or language therapy may continue
throughout a student's school year either in the form of direct
therapy or on a consultant basis.  The speech-language
pathologist may assist vocational teachers and counselors in
establishing communication goals related to the work experiences
of students and suggest strategies that are effective for the
important transition from school to employment and adult life.</P>


<P>     Communication has many components.  All serve to increase
the way people learn about the world around them, utilize
knowledge and skills, and interact with colleagues, family and
friends.</P>

<P>May 1995</P>

<P> The development of spoken/oral language normally occurs without formal teaching. It develops as a result of exposure to spoken language. Problems with language development may not be recognized for a long time unless the child simply fails to begin talking. Oral language is the basis for learning reading and written language and for benefitting from instruction in other areas. It is important to identify children whose language is not developing normally so that more specific stimulation and actual intervention can begin as early as possible.</P>

<p> Language problems, like other learning disabilities, are called by several different names including: delayed language, language disorder, language disability, specific language disability, etc. Some people distinguish between children who appear to be developing all aspects of language at a slower rate (delayed language) and those who do not appear to be developing language in the expected way or have uneven language development (language disability). Regardless of the label, language problems should be assessed. A language evaluation must include a hearing test since hearing loss is one reason for delayed language acquisition. Speech-language pathologists typically do the testing for spoken language disabilities. When children are of school age, the evaluation must include the language of instruction and reading and written language.</P>

<p> Like other types of learning disabilities, language disabilities differ in type and severity. In young children there are many known milestones that can be observed by parents and preschool teachers. Some of these are listed on the enclosed sheet along with some activities to encourage language development. (KidSource OnLine Editors note:  See <a href="speech_language.html">Speech &amp; Language Milestone Chart </a>)</P>

<p> Even mild problems in spoken language can have an impact on learning in school. A child should enter first grade with the majority of the language needed for learning. Problems in understanding language will affect almost every aspect of school: following directions, learning vocabulary, understanding instruction, reading comprehension, etc. Problems in using language are often seen in children who do not understand. Some children understand spoken language but have difficulty expressing themselves. A common problem seen in expressive language is difficulty recalling words they know (word retrieval problems). These children understand the word, know it when they hear it, but cannot always call it up when they need it. These children may
say, "you know that thing you sweep the floor with"; "I know it, but I can't think of the word"; "Umm,umm, I forget"; etc. Retrieval problems can make children unwilling to participate in class because they interfere with a child's demonstration of what he/she has learned. For example, children may have learned color or letter names, but are unable to give the names when asked. These children can point to the color or letter when the name is said to them.</P>

<p> Some children have difficulty with spoken grammar. They omit words or word endings or get words in the wrong order. Some have difficulty putting their ideas into words in an organized way.</P>

<p> Problems in pronunciation of words can be the result of mishearing sounds (Starvation Army/Salvation Army), getting sounds in the wrong order (aminal/animal), or difficulty producing specific sounds (fum/thumb). Problems with the sound system of language have been reported in many children who have difficulty learning to read. While some speech sounds are acquired later than others, children who have many sounds they cannot make and are difficult to understand may have later problems with phonics.</P>

<p> Language activities with young children are fun for them and can stimulate more language. Reading to children and talking about the pictures and the "story" is an important activity. Making certain new vocabulary is used in many ways and in different situations helps children learn new words.</P>

<p>It is important to have children's language evaluated if there is any concern. Too often, parents are told "he'll outgrow it" or "just wait, she'll talk when she's ready". This is not good advice when the child is not doing what is expected for his/her age. Speech-language pathologists can determine what the problem is, if any, and make recommendations for working with the child. Oral language is important for social development and effective communication, as well as being the foundation for school learning. Problems should not be overlooked or disregarded.</P>

<P>
PHILADELPHIA, March 11, 1996  -- Patients be aware! Are the contents inside your medicine cabinet hazardous? To kick off Poison Prevention Week (March 17-23) the Philadelphia Association of Retail Druggists (PARD), a non-profit organization which represents independent community pharmacies throughout the Delaware Valley, encourages patients to take time out of their busy schedules to poison proof their homes. </p>

<P>"Taking the time to make sure medication is properly labeled can save lives. Talking to your pharmacist about the safest ways to store and use your medicines can also help prevent accidental poisonings," stresses Gerald Mazzucca, PARD Executive Director.</P>

<P>To ensure that patients don't fall victim to accidental poisonings, PARD provides these recommendations:</P>

<P>Clean out your medicine cabinet periodically and throw out all of the following:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Any medication that has changed color or formed a residue at the bottom of the bottle.<BR><BR>
 	<LI>Medications that are expired or more than two years old.<BR><BR>
 	<LI>Aspirin that is crumbly or gives off a vinegary odor.<BR><BR>
 	<LI>Hydrogen peroxide that no longer bubbles when applied to skin or scalp.<BR><BR>
	<LI>Ointments that have separated or become discolored.<BR><BR>
	<LI>Leftover eye wash or eye drops (fungus growth may develop).<BR><BR>
</UL>


<P>Each year in the United States, half of the 2 billion filled prescriptions are taken improperly and the majority of patients don't ask any questions about their prescriptions. PARD pharmacists are committed to reducing these statistics. Most provide one-on-one consultations for patients with questions about their medications.</P>
                         
<P>In support of this year's poison prevention theme, "Children Act Fast ... So do Poisons," PARD recommends the following:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Never refer to medication as candy.<BR><BR>
	<LI>Keep all medications safely out of children's reach. All cabinets, drawers and medicine cabinets should have child-proof locks.<BR><BR>
	<LI>Use products with child-resistant packaging, especially medicines
                    	and household chemicals and close securely.<BR><BR>
	<LI>Store medicines and household products in their original containers -- never in cups or soft-drink bottles.<BR><BR>
</UL>
                         
<P>For senior adults, PARD advises:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Never mix medications in a single container. Some chemicals react with each other and neutralize the medicines or cause harmful side.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Keep your pharmacist informed about additions and deletions your medications to prevent hazardous drug interactions.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Categorize all your medications to prevent confusion. Talk to  your community pharmacist about developing a medication management schedule.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Keep all medications out of the reach of your grandchildren.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>Poison prevention tips regardless of age:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Never administer or take medications prescribed to someone else, even if the symptoms are similar.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Always turn on the lights before taking or giving any medications to ensure that you are able to identify medication properly. <BR><BR>

	<LI>In an emergency situation, call the Poison Control Center immediately at 215-386-2100, or 800-722-7112 outside the 215 area code.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>To receive free literature on preventing accidental poisonings, call PARD at 215-387-6180.</P>

<P>     The home areas listed below are the most common site of
accidental poisonings. Follow this checklist to learn how to
correct situations that may lead to poisonings.  If you answer
"No" to any questions, fix the situation quickly.  Your goal is
to have all your answers "Yes."
                                                                </P>

     have child-resistant caps?  Products like
     furniture polishes, drain cleaners and

     their original containers?  There are two
     dangers if products aren't stored in
     their original containers.  Labels on the
     original containers often give first aid
     information if someone should swallow the
     product.  And if products are stored in
     containers like drinking glasses or pop
     bottles, someone may think it is food and
     swallow it.                         </td><td> ____ </td><td>

     been put up high and out of reach of
     children?  The best way to prevent
     poisoning is making sure that it's
     impossible to find and get at the
     poisons.  Locking all cabinets that hold
     dangerous products is the best poison
     prevention.      </td><td> ____ </td><td>

<tr><th>Item</th><th>Questions</th><th> Yes</th> <th> No</th></tr> <tr>
<td>1.</td><td>   Did you ever stop to think that medicines
     could poison if used improperly?  Many
     children are poisoned each year by
     overdoses of aspirin.  If aspirin can
     poison, just think of how many other
     poisons might be in your medicine
     cabinet.             </td><td> ____ </td><td>
                  ____</td></tr><tr>

<td>2.</td><td>    Do your aspirins and other potentially
     harmful products have child-resistant
     closures?  Aspirins and most prescription
     drugs come with child-resistant caps.
     Check to see yours have them, and that
     they are properly secured.  Check your
     prescriptions before leaving the pharmacy
     to make sure the medicines are in child-
     resistant packaging.  These caps have
     been shown to save the lives of children.     </td><td> ____ </td><td>

                  ____</td></tr><tr>

<td>3.</td><td>    Have you thrown out all out-of-date
     prescriptions?  As medicines get older,
     the chemicals inside them can change.  So
     what was once a good medicine may now be
     a dangerous poison.  Flush all old drugs
     down the toilet.  Rinse the container
     well, then discard it.       </td><td> ____ </td><td>
                  ____</td></tr><tr>

<td>4.</td><td>    Are all medicines in their original
     containers with the original labels?
     Prescription medicines may or may not
     list ingredients.  The prescription
     number on the label will, however, allow
     rapid identification by the pharmacist of
     the ingredients should they not be
     listed.  Without the original label and
     container, you can't be sure of what
     you're taking.  After all, aspirin looks
     a lot like poisonous roach tablets.             </td><td> ____
</td><td>
                  ____</td></tr><tr>

<td>5.</td><td>   If your vitamins or vitamin/mineral
     supplements contain iron, are they in
     child-resistant packaging?  Most people
     think of vitamins and minerals as foods
     and, therefore, nontoxic, but a few iron
     pills can kill a child.      </td><td> ____ </td><td>____ </td></tr>

<P>When all your answers are "Yes," then continue this level of

potentially harmful products, they have child-resistant closures
and are kept out of sight and reach. Post the number of the

<P>     In 1986 the Consumer Product Safety Commission conducted a
survey of 2,015 accidental ingestions of oral prescription drugs
by children under five that had been reported to 9 Poison Control
Centers around the country.  The findings of this study indicate
that all consumers regardless of whether they have young children
of their own or not, should always take care to obtain their
prescriptions in child-resistant packaging, to close the caps
tightly, and to keep medicine stored out of sight and out of
reach.</P>

<P>     Thirty-one percent of all medication involved in the
reported accidental ingestions belonged to someone other than the
child's immediate family, such as grandparents and other older
adults.  The medicines belonging to this group were some of the
most toxic in the study and therefore presented the greatest
potential for real tragedy.  In addition, these individuals may
not always think about taking extra precautions to keep their
medicine out of reach when young children are around.</P>

<P>     According to the survey results, many of the ingestions
involved non child-resistant containers that had been dispensed
to parents with young children.  This indicates that some
pharmacists are not aware that all oral prescription drugs must
be dispensed in child-resistant packaging unless non
child-resistant packaging is specifically requested.  These
parents were dangerously unaware that the packaging provided no
child-resistant protection.</P>

<P>     Just prior to the accidental ingestion, most medicine was
stored where it was convenient to take, which made it readily
accessible to children.  Kitchen counters, kitchen tables, and
kitchen cabinets were some of the most common storage places.</P>

<P>     The Consumer Product Safety Commission the American
Association of Poison Control Centers, and the Poison Prevention
Week Council urge all consumers to use child-resistant packaging
and to store medicines out of sight and out of reach whenever
young children are around.</P>

Don't wait for the school to contactyou.  It's important to resolve problems as soon as possible whenthey occur.  When parents work with teachers, they are often ableto improve a child's performance in school.  Children also get thesense that education is really important when they see their parentsinvolved with their teachers and their school.  Parents feel a senseof accomplishment, too, when they help their children succeed inschool.  Ask your child's teacher for specific activities you can doat home with your child and help the teacher better understandwhat works best with your child.  Make it clear that if the teachersees a problem developing, you want to hear about it immediately. Then, meet with your child's teacher frequently until the problemis resolved.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR><a name="Child"></a><H3> What If My Child Doesn't Like School?</h3> <P>Using your unique knowledge of your child, try to find out whyhe or she seems unhappy with school.  Observe and listen to yourchild.  The problem may not lie with school itself, but with peersor friends.  It may also be a family problem or an issue of self-esteem.  Arrange for a conference with the teacher or schoolcounselor.  Work toward being able to discuss problems with yourchild openly, and listen carefully to his or her views before youoffer any solutions.</P> <P>Children whose parents are involved in their education have bettergrades, a more positive attitude toward school, and moreappropriate school behavior than those with less involved parents. So don't underestimate what YOU, as a parent, can contribute toyour child's learning experiences, no matter how much educationyou yourself have.

<H3>Steps You Can Take To Improve Your Children's Education</H3>

  <H4>Read together</H4>

<P>   Children who read at home with their parents perform better in school.
   Show your kids how much you value reading by keeping good books,
   magazine, and newspapers in the house. Let them see you read. Take
   them on trips to the library and encourage them to get library cards.
   Let children read to you, and talk about the books. What was the book
   about? Why did a character act that way? What will he or she do next?
  </P>
<P>   Look for other ways to teach children the magic of language, words,
   and stories. Tell stories to your children about their families and
   their culture. Point out words to children wherever you go -- to the
   grocery, to the pharmacy, to the gas station. Encourage your children
   to write notes to grandparents and other relatives.</P>

  <H4>Use TV wisely</H4>

<P>   Academic achievement drops sharply for children who watch more than 10
   hours of television a week, or an average of more than two hours a
   day. Parents can limit the amount of viewing and help children select
   educational programs. Parents can also watch and discuss shows with
   their kids. This will help children understand how stories are
   structured.</P>

  <H4>Establish a daily family routine with scheduled homework time</H4>

<P>   Studies show that successful students have parents who create and
   maintain family routines. Make sure your child goes to school every
   day. Establish a regular time for homework each afternoon or evening,
   set aside a quiet, well lit place, and encourage children to study.
   Routines generally include time performing chores, eating meals
   together, and going to bed at an established time.</P>


 <HR>
 <blockquote>
<P>     "The American family is the rock on which a solid education can be
     built. I have seen examples all over this nation where two-parent
     families, single parents, stepparents, grandparents, aunts, and
     uncles are providing strong families support for their children to
     learn. If families teach the love of learning, it can make all the
     difference in the world to their children."</P>

<P>     -Richard W. Riley<BR>
     U.S. Secretary of Education</P>

</blockquote>
<HR>

  <H4>Talk to your children and teenagers -- and listen to them, too</H4>

<P>   Talk directly to your children, especially your teenagers, about the
   dangers of drugs and alcohol and the values you want them to have. Set
   a good example. And listen to what your children have to say. Such
   personal talks, however uncomfortable they may make you feel, can save
   their lives.</P>

  <H4>Express high expectations for children by enrolling them in challenging
  courses</H4>

<P>   You can communicate to your children the importance of setting and
   meeting challenges in school. Tell your children that working hard and
   stretching their minds in the only way for them to realize their full
   potential. Expect and encourage your children to take tough academic
   courses like geometry, chemistry, computer technology, a second
   language, art, and advanced occupational courses. Make sure they never
   settle for doing less than their best.
  </P>
  <H4>Find out whether your school has high standards</H4>

<P>   Your school should have clear, challenging standards for what students
   should know. For example, what reading, writing and math skills is
   your child expected to have by fourth grade? By eighth and twelfth
   grades? What about history, science, the arts, geography, and other
   languages? Are responsibility and hard work recognized? If your school
   doesn't have high standards, join with teachers, principals, and other
   parents to set these standards.</P>

  <H4>Keep in touch with the school
  </H4>
<P>   Parents cannot afford to wait for schools to tell them how children
   are doing. Families who stay informed about their children's progress
   at school have higher-achieving children. To keep informed, parents
   can visit the school or talk with teachers on the telephone. Get to
   know the names of your children's teachers, principals, and
   counselors.
  </P>
<P>   Parents can also work with schools to develop new ways to get more
   involved. Families can establish a homework hotline, volunteer on
   school planning and decision-making committees, help create family
   resource centers, serve as mentors, and even help patrol school
   grounds.</P>

  <H4>Use community resource</H4>

<P>   Activities sponsored by community and religious organizations provide
   opportunities for children and other family members to engage in
   positive social and learning experiences. Family- oriented community
   resources may include health care services, housing assistance, adult
   education, family literacy, and employment counseling. Families can
   reinforce their children's learning by going to libraries, museums,
   free concerts, and cultural fairs together.
  </P>
<P>When parents and families get personally involved in education, their
children
do better in school and grow up to be more successful in life.</P>

  <H3> Sounds like common sense, doesn't it?</H3>

<P>   Yet parental involvement is one of the most overlooked aspects of
   American education today. The fact is, many parents don't realize how
   important it is to get involved in their children's learning. As one
   dad said when he began to read to his daughter ever day and discovered
   that it improved her learning, "I never realized how much it would
   mean to her to hear me read." Other parents would like to be involved,
   but have trouble finding the time.
  </P>
<P>   All parents and family members should try to find the time and make
   the effort because research shows that when families get involved,
   their children:
  </P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI> Get better grades and test scores.
     	<LI> Graduate from high school at higher rates.
     	<LI> Are more likely to go on to higher education.
     	<LI> Are better behaved and have more positive attitudes.
       	
</UL>
<P>   Family involvement is also _one of the best investments_ a family can
   make. Students who graduate from high school earn, on average,
   $200,000 more in their lifetimes than students who drop out. College
   graduate makes almost $1 million more!
  </P>
<P>   Most important of all, ALL parents and families can enjoy these
   benefits. It doesn't matter how much money you have. It doesn't matter
   how much formal education you've had yourself or how well you did in
   school. And family involvement works for children at all grade levels.

<a name="What"></a>  
  <H3>What is "Family Involvement in Education"?
  </H3>
<P>   It's a lot of different types of activities. Some parents and families
   may have the time to get involved in many ways. Other may only have
   the time for one or two activities. But whatever your level of
   involvement, remember: -If you get involved and stay involved, you can
   make a world of difference.-
  </P>
<P>   Family involvement in education can mean: -Reading a bedtime story to
   your preschool child...checking homework every night...getting
   involved in PTA...discussing your children's progress with
   teachers...voting in school board elections...helping your school to
   set challenging academic standards...limiting TV viewing to no more
   than two hours on school nights...getting personally involved in
   governing your school...becoming an advocate for better education in
   your community and state...and insisting on high standards of behavior
   for children.-
  </P>
<P>   Or, family involvement can be as simple as asking your children, "How
   was school today?" But ask every day. That will send your children the
   clear message that -their schoolwork is important to you and you
   expect them to learn.-
  </P>
<P>   Many children and parents are yearning for this kind of togetherness
   these days. Among student aged 10 to 13, for example, 72 percent say
   they would like to talk to their parents more about their homework.
   Forty percent of parents across the country believe that they are not
   devoting enough time to their children's education. And teachers say
   that increasing parental involvement in education should be the number
   one priority for public education in the next few years.
  </P>

<a name="Foreword"></a>
<h3>Foreword </h3>

     This is the question we parents are always trying to
answer. It's good that children ask questions: that's the best
way to learn. All children have two wonderful resources for
learning--imagination and curiosity. As a parent, you can
awaken your children to the joy of learning by encouraging
their imagination and curiosity.
<br><br>
     Helping Your Child Succeed in School is one in a series of
books on different education topics intended to help you make
the most of your child's natural curiosity. Teaching and
learning are not mysteries that can only happen in school. They
also happen when parents and children do simple things
together.
<br><br>
     For instance, you and your child can: sort the socks on
laundry day--sorting is a major function in math and science;
cook a meal together--cooking involves not only math and
science but good health as well; tell and read each other
stories--storytelling is the basis for reading and writing (and
a story about the past is also history); or play a game of
hopscotch together--playing physical games will help your child
learn to count and start on a road to lifelong fitness.

  <br><br>   By doing things together, you will show that learning is
fun and important. You will be encouraging your child to study,
learn, and stay in school.
<br><br>
     All of the books in this series tie in with the National
Education Goals set by the President and the Governors. The
goals state that, by the year 2000: every child will start
school ready to learn; at least 90 percent of all students will
graduate from high school; each American student will leave the
4th, 8th, and 12th grades demonstrating competence in core
subjects; U.S. students will be first in the world in math and
science achievement; every American adult will be literate,
will have the skills necessary to compete in a global economy,
and will be able to exercise the rights and responsibilities of
citizenship; and American schools will be liberated from drugs
and violence so they can focus on learning.
<br><br>
     This book is a way for you to help meet these goals. It
will give you a short run-down on facts, but the biggest part
of the book is made up of simple, fun activities for you and
your child to do together. Your child may even beg you to do
them. At the end of the book is a list of resources, so you can
continue the fun.
<br><br>
     As U.S. Education Secretary Lamar Alexander has said:
<br><br>
     The first teachers are the parents, both by example and
     conversation. But don't think of it as teaching. Think of
     it as fun.
<br><br>
     So, let's get started. I invite you to find an activity in
this book and try it.

<h3> <a name ="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

What is the earliest memory you have of being in school?

<ul>
<li>Excitement? 
<li>Fear? 
<li><li>Wonder? 
Rejection? 
<li>Joy? 
</ul>

     How do you feel about your years in school? If you have
happy memories, chances are you can help your children be
excited about learning and have good memories, too. If you
disliked school, it's harder, but you can do lots of things to
help make school a better experience for your children than it
was for you.
<br><br>
     The good news is that every child in every family has the
power to succeed in school and in life, and every parent,
grandparent, and caregiver can help.
<br><br>
     But how do we help our children succeed? How do we give
them the power? The most important thing we can do is be
involved with our children's education even before they are in
school, then stay involved once they are in school.
<br><br>
     This book is about what we can do in our own homes, right
now, that will help our children go to school wanting to learn.
It includes:
<br><br>
   * Basic information on what we know about success in school;
<br><br>
   * Activities for children ages 5-11 to help them acquire the
     skills to succeed;
<br><br>
   * Questions and answers about when to talk to the teacher
     and how to handle parent-teacher conferences.
<br><br>
     Success in school takes hard work, planning, a few basic
skills, and the will to want to succeed. How do we pass these
ideas on to our children?
<br><br>
     What we know about success in school is a combination of
common sense mixed with new ideas about learning.
<br><br>

     We do know the following:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>1. Where our children learn is important. We can find
     inexpensive and easy things to do at home--where our 
     children first start learning--that will make them want to
     learn. We can also strengthen our ties with the community
     and the schools, where learning continues.

 <li>2. What our children learn from us is important. What we say
     and do can build their maturity and self-confidence.

  <li>3. How our children learn from us is important. All of us
     teach our children every day, whether we realize it or
     not. We can make sure we show them a variety of ways to
     learn.
</ul>

     Now, how do we take these facts and turn them into ways to
help our children do well in school?<BR><BR>

<h4>Where Our Children Learn</h4>

<B><I>At Home</I></B>
<br><br>
     It's no surprise to anyone that children need time with
their parents. And even though most parents are extremely busy,
whether they work outside of the home or not, they do find time
to spend with their children. But they want that time to count
in helping prepare their children for the world they will find
outside the home.
<br><br>
     What counts most is what we say and do at home, not how
rich or poor we are or how many years of school we have
finished. When children can count on getting attention at home,
they have a greater sense of security and self-worth. This will
help them do better not only in school, but also when they grow
up.
<br><br>
     If you think about it, school, while very important, does
not really take up very much time. In the United States, the
school year averages 180 days; in other industrialized nations,
the school year can extend up to 240 days, and students are
often in school more hours per day. So, the hours and days a
child is not in school are important for learning, too.
<br><br>
     Communicating. This is probably the most important
activity we can do in our home, and it doesn't cost anything.
Ask questions, listen for answers. These are no-cost,
high-value things to do.
<br><br>
     Think of conversation as being like a tennis game with
talk, instead of a ball, bouncing back and forth. Communication
can happen any time, any place--in the car, on a bus, at
mealtime, at bedtime.
<br><br>
     When our children enter and continue school with good
habits of communication, they are in a position to succeed--to
learn all that has to be learned, and to become confident
students.<br><br>

<b><I>Starting early.</I> </b><br><br>

Here are some things you can do when your
children are young:<br>
<ul><li>Let them see you read, and read to them and with them.
     Visit the library. If they are old enough, make sure they
     have their own card. Keep books, magazines, and newspapers
     around the house.
<li>Keep pencils and paper, crayons, and washable markers
     handy for notes, grocery lists, and schoolwork. Writing
     takes practice, and it starts at home.
<li>Teach children to do things for themselves rather than do
     the work for them. Patience when children are young pays
     off later.
<li>Help children, when needed, to break a job down into small
     pieces, then do the job one step at a time. This works for
     everything--getting dressed, a job around the house, or a
     big homework assignment.
<li>Develop, with your child, a reasonable, consistent
     schedule of jobs around the house. List them on a
     calendar, day by day.
<li>Every home needs consistent rules children can depend on.
     Put a plan into action, and follow through.
<li>Give each child an easy-to-reach place in which to put
     things away.
<li>Set limits on TV viewing so that everyone can get work
     done with less background noise.
<li>
   Watch TV with your children and talk about what you see.
</ul>

<b><I>Handling homework.</I></b><br><br>
 These are the messages to get across to
your children about homework:
<br>
<ul>

   <li>Education is important. Homework has to be done. Let
     children know that this is what you value.

   <li>Try to have a special place where each child can study.

   <li>Help your children plan how to do all the things they need
     to do--study, work around the house, play, etc.

  <li>Let your children know that you have confidence in them.
     Remind them of specific successes they have had in the
     past perhaps in swimming, soccer, cooking, or in doing a
     difficult homework assignment.

   <li>Don't expect or demand perfection. When children ask you
     to look at what they've done--from skating a figure 8 to a
     math assignment--show interest and praise them when
     they've done something well. If you have criticisms or
     suggestions, make them in a helpful way.
</ul>

     The time we spend exchanging ideas at home with our
children is vitally important in setting the tone, the
attitudes, and the behaviors that make the difference in
school.<br><br>

<B><I>In the Community</I></B><br><br>

     In many parts of our nation, the ties among neighbors have
been weakened. For the sake of our children, they need to be
rebuilt, and you can help. Be sure to introduce your children
to your neighbors. You might even try a "child watch" program
where adults who are home during the day keep an eye out for
children when they walk to and from school and stand at bus
stops.<br><br>

     Some schools are helping families connect with the
community by, for example, becoming centers for social services
as well as for education. Getting to know your child's school
can help you, in a very real way, get to know a major part of
your community. It can also help you build a network of wider
community support for your family.<br><br>


<B><I>At School</I></B><br><br>

     Parents can become involved with the schools in several
different ways, by working with children at home, volunteering,
sharing information, and helping to make policy. We need to
remember that what works in one community (or for one family)
may not necessarily work in another.<br><br>

     It may no longer be possible for parents to volunteer as
often for school activities. However, working with children at
home and sharing information with the school are two things all
parents can do.<br><br>

     The section after the activities, "Parents and the
Schools," has some suggestions on how to get the most out of
talking to your child's teacher. Many teachers say they rarely
receive information from parents about problems at home. Many
parents say they don't know what the school expects of their
child. Sharing information is essential, and both teachers and
parents are responsible for making it happen.<br><br>

     With our help, our children can become confident students,
able to handle the challenges of school. This means:<br>
<ul>

   <li>Talking with our children about the value of hard work and
     about the importance of education;

   <li>Talking about what's happening in school;

   <li>Reading report cards and messages that come from school;

   <li>Going to school and meeting with teachers;

   <li>Taking part in school events when you can; and

   <li>Finding out about resources in the community.
</ul>


<h4>What Our Children Learn From Us</h4>


     Sometimes we think that all our children need to know to
be ready to start school are the ABCs and how to count. The
reality is that most children can learn these things pretty
fast once they get to school. What they do need--and what you
can give--is the message that education is valuable: through
education, people can shape their own future.<br><br>

     So, talk about learning, share the fun and excitement of
new skills. Show your children that you are always learning,
too. Read aloud, play games, and talk about events around the
block and around the world.<br><br>

     Children tend to follow the examples set for them. When we
say one thing and do another, children watch and learn. When we
practice what we preach, children watch and learn.<br><br>

     The bottom line is that when we give our children the
support and information they need, and expect them to do well,
they do better in school and in life.<br><br>

<h4>How Our Children Learn From Us</h4>


     Children need active, even noisy, learning as well as
quiet learning such as reading. Active learning includes asking
and answering questions (and trying to get more than just "yes"
or "no" answers); solving problems; and discussing a variety of
topics.<br><br>

     Active learning can also take place when a child plays
sports, spends time with friends, or goes to a museum or zoo.
The active learning suggestions in the next section will help
you think of even more things for you and your children to do.<br><br>

     Limit TV watching. Watching TV is an example of a quiet
activity that children can learn from, but one that is a
problem in almost every home. We know that children who watch a
lot of TV learn less and get lower grades than students who
watch little TV. And in international comparisons, U.S.
students rank high in watching TV, but are near the bottom in
doing homework. The result is that U.S. students know less than
those in other countries.<br><br>

     Encourage active learning. What can we do? We can listen
to our children's ideas and respond to them. We can let them
jump in with questions and opinions when reading books
together. When this type of give-and-take between parent and
child happens at home, a child's participation and interest in
school increases.<br><br>

<h4>What Messages To Send</h4>


     Three of the important messages our children need about
success in school can be sent by:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>1. Sharing our own experiences and goals with our children,
     because children tend to adopt our ideals. They need to
     know how we feel about making an effort, working hard, and
     planning ahead.

  <li>2. Establishing realistic, consistent family rules for work
     around the house so our children can develop schedules and
     stable routines. Children need limits set even though they
     will test these limits over and over again. Children need
     to know what they can depend on--and they need to be able
     to depend on the rules we make.

  <li>3. Encouraging our children to think about the future. Our
     children need realistic, reasonable expectations, and they
     need the satisfaction of having some of these expectations
     met. They need to take part in making decisions (and to
     learn that sometimes this means sacrificing fun now for
     benefits later) and they need to find out what happens as
     a result of decisions they have made.
</ul>
<br>

     Throw a stone into a pool and the circles widen and
overlap. None of us lives in isolation. The circles of home,
community, and school overlap also. For our children to learn
and thrive, they need the support and encouragement of all of
the circles in which we live. But the circle in the center is
the home and that's where it all starts.<br><br>

<h3>What We Can Do
To Help Our Children Learn</h3>

<ul>
<li>Listen to them and pay attention to their problems. Read with
them.

<li>Tell family stories.

<li>Limit their television watching.

<li>Have books and other reading materials in the house.

<li>Look up words in the dictionary with them.

<li>Encourage them to use an encyclopedia.

<li>Share favorite poems and songs with them.

<li>Take them to the library--get them their own library cards.

<li>Take them to museums and historical sites, when possible.

<li>Discuss the daily news with them.

<li>Go exploring with them and learn about plants, animals, and
geography.

<li>Find a quiet place for them to study 

<li>Review their homework.

<li>Meet with their teachers.

<li>Do you have any other ideas?<BR><BR>

<P>Students who are gifted and talented are found in full-time
self-contained classrooms, magnet schools, pull-out programs, resource
rooms, regular classrooms, and every combination of these settings. No
matter where they obtain their education, they need an appropriately
differentiated curriculum designed to address their individual
characteristics, needs, abilities, and interests.</P>

<a name="Developing"></a>
<H3>Developing An Effective Curriculum</H3>

<P>An effective curriculum for students who are gifted is essentially a
basic curriculum that has been modified to meet their needs. The
unique characteristics of the students must serve as the basis for
decisions on how the curriculum should be modified (Feldhusen, Hansen,
&amp; Kennedy, 1989; Maker 1982; TAG, 1989; VanTassel-Baska et al., 1988).</P>

<P>It is difficult to generalize about students who are gifted because
their characteristics and needs are so personal and unique. However,
as a group they comprehend complex ideas quickly, learn more rapidly
and in greater depth than their age peers, and may exhibit interests
that differ from those of their peers. They need time for in-depth
exploration, they manipulate ideas and draw generalizations about
seemingly unconnected concepts, and they ask provocative questions.</P>

<P>A program that builds on these characteristics may be viewed as
qualitatively (rather than quantitatively) different from the basic
curriculum; it results from appropriate modification of content,
process, environment, and product (Maker, 1982).</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Content"></a>
<H3>Modifying Content</H3>

<P>Content consists of ideas, concepts, descriptive information, and
facts. Content, as well as learning experiences, can be modified
through acceleration, compacting, variety, reorganization, flexible
pacing, and the use of more advanced or complex concepts,
abstractions, and materials. When possible, students should be
encouraged to move through content areas at their own pace. If they
master a particular unit, they need to be provided with more advanced
learning activities, not more of the same activity. Their learning
characteristics are best served by thematic, broad-based, and
integrative content, rather than just single-subject areas. An entire
content area arranged and structured around a conceptual framework can
be mastered in much less time than is traditionally allotted
(VanTassel-Baska, 1989). In addition, such concept-based instruction
expands opportunities to generalize and to integrate and apply ideas.
(See Bruner, 1966, MAN: A COURSE OF STUDY MACOS for an example of a
thematic, integrated curriculum.)</P>

<P>Middle and secondary schools are generally organized to meet student
needs within content areas. Providing an interdisciplinary approach is
another way of modifying curriculum . Jacobs and Borland (1986) found
that gifted students benefit greatly from curriculum experiences that
cross or go beyond traditional content areas, particularly when they
are encouraged to acquire an integrated understanding of knowledge and
the structure of the disciplines.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Process"></a>
<H3>Modifying Process</H3>

<P>To modify process, activities must be restructured to be more
intellectually demanding. For example, students need to be challenged
by questions that require a higher level of response or by open-ended
questions that stimulate inquiry, active exploration, and discovery.
Although instructional strategies depend on the age of the students
and the nature of the disciplines involved, the goal is always to
encourage students to think about subjects in more abstract and
complex ways. Activity selection should be based on student interests,
and activities should be used in ways that encourage self-directed
learning. Bloom's TAXONOMY OF EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES (1956) offers the
most common approach to process modification. His classification
system moves from more basic levels of thought, such as memory or
recall, to more complex levels of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.
Parnes (1966), Taba (1962), and others have provided additional models
for structuring thinking skills. Every teacher should know a variety
of ways to stimulate and encourage higher level thinking skills. Group
interaction and simulations, flexible pacing, and guided
self-management are a few of the methods for managing class activities
that support process modification.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Environment"></a>
<H3>Modifying Environment</H3>

<P>Gifted students learn best in a receptive, nonjudgmental,
student-centered environment that encourages inquiry and independence,
includes a wide variety of materials, provides some physical movement,
is generally complex, and connects the school experience with the
greater world. Although all students might appreciate such an
environment, for students who are gifted it is essential that the
teacher establish a climate that encourages them to question, exercise
independence, and use their creativity in order to be all that they
can be.</P>

<a name="Product"></a>
<H3>Modifying Product Expectation and Student Response</H3>

<P>Teachers can encourage students to demonstrate what they have learned
in a wide variety of forms that reflect both knowledge and the ability
to manipulate ideas. For example, instead of giving a written or oral
book report, students might prefer to design a game around the theme
and characters of a book. Products can be consistent with each
student's preferred learning style. They should address real problems,
concerns, and audiences; synthesize rather than summarize information;
and include a self-evaluation process.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Assessing"></a>
<H3>Assessing Curriculum Effectiveness</H3>

<P>In their synthesis of curriculum effectiveness studies and effective
practice, VanTassel-Baska et al. (1988) suggested that differentiated
curriculum would respond to diverse characteristics of gifted learners
in the following three ways: </P>
<UL Type=Disc>
    <LI> By accelerating the mastery of basic skills through testing-out
procedures and reorganization of the curriculum according to higher
level skills and concepts. <BR><BR>

     <LI> By engaging students in active problem-finding and
problem-solving activities and research. <BR><BR>

     <LI> By providing students opportunities for making connections
within and across systems of knowledge by focusing on issues, themes,
and ideas.<BR><BR>
</UL>
<P>Curriculum development is a dynamic, ongoing process. Special
attention needs to be paid to articulation, scope, and sequence to
avoid gaps and repetition through grade levels; ensure that the
understandings and skills we expect children to develop fit together;
and assure that children are provided with the knowledge and skills
that will prepare them for the future. Periodic evaluations of
curriculum effectiveness allow corrections to be made when needed, and
they are essential if curriculum is to meet the long-term needs of
gifted students for increasingly complex and challenging
opportunities.</P>

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>The curriculum committee of the Leadership Training Institute (Passow,
1982) developed seven guiding principles for curriculum
differentiation that reflect the considerations described in this
Digest. </P>
<OL Type=1 Start="1">
    <LI> The content of curricula for gifted students should focus on
and be organized to include more elaborate, complex, and in-depth
study of major ideas, problems, and themes that integrate knowledge
within and across systems of thought.<BR><BR>

       <LI> Curricula for gifted students should allow for the development
and application of productive thinking skills to enable students to
reconceptualize existing knowledge and/or generate new knowledge. <BR><BR>

    <LI> Curricula for gifted students should enable them to explore
constantly changing knowledge and information and develop the attitude
that knowledge is worth pursuing in an open world. <BR><BR>

     <LI> Curricula for gifted students should encourage exposure to,
selection, and use of appropriate and specialized resources. <BR><BR>

     <LI> Curricula for gifted students should promote self-initiated
and self-directed learning and growth. <BR><BR>

     <LI> Curricula for gifted students should provide for the
development of self-understanding and the understanding of one's
relationship to persons, societal institutions, nature, and culture. <BR><BR>

       <LI> Evaluations of curricula for gifted students should be
conducted in accordance with the previously stated principles,
stressing higher level thinking skills, creativity, and excellence in
performance and products.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>Developing curriculum that is sufficiently rigorous, challenging, and
coherent for students who are gifted is a challenging task. The
result, however, is well worth the effort. Appropriately
differentiated curriculum produces well-educated, knowledgeable
students who have had to work very hard, have mastered a substantial
body of knowledge, and can think clearly and critically about that
knowledge. Achieving such results for one or for a classroom full of
students who are gifted will produce high levels of satisfaction, not
only for the students who are beneficiaries, but also for every
teacher who is willing to undertake the task.</P>

<P> A particular challenge for middle school teachers is being able to 
differentiate or adapt instruction to respond to the diverse student 
needs found in inclusive, mixed-ability classrooms.  This digest 
provides an overview of some key principles for differentiating 
instruction, with an emphasis on the learning needs of academically 
advanced learners.    </P>

<a name="Why"></a>
<H3>Why Differentiate Instruction?  </H3>

<P>A single seventh grade heterogeneous language arts class 
is likely to include students who can read and comprehend 
as well as most college learners; students
who can barely decode words, comprehend meaning, or apply basic 
information; and students who fall somewhere between these extremes.  
There are students whose primary interests lie in science, sports, 
music, or a dozen other fields.  There are students who learn best by 
working alone and those who are most successful working in groups.  
Further, the learning profiles of young adolescents often change 
rapidly as they develop.  There simply is no single learning template 
for the general middle school class.  If middle school students differ
in readiness, interest, and learning profiles, and if a good middle 
school attempts to meet  each student where he or she is and foster 
continual growth, a one-size-fits-all model of instruction makes 
little sense.  Rather, differentiated instruction seems a better 
solution for meeting the academic diversity that typifies the middle 
school years.   </P>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Differentiation Is--And Is Not </H3>

<P>A differentiated classroom offers a variety of learning options 
designed to tap into different readiness levels, interests, and 
learning profiles.  In a  differentiated class, the teacher uses (1) a
variety of ways for students to  explore curriculum content, (2) a 
variety of sense-making activities or processes through which 
students can come to understand and "own" information  and ideas, and 
(3) a variety of options through which students can demonstrate  or 
exhibit what they have learned.          </P>

<P>A class is not differentiated when assignments are the same for all  
learners and the adjustments consist of varying the level of 
difficulty of  questions for certain students, grading some students 
harder than others, or letting students who finish early play games 
for enrichment.  It is not  appropriate to have more advanced learners
do extra math problems, extra book reports, or after completing their
"regular" work be given extension assignments.  Asking students to do
more of what they already know is hollow.   Asking them to do "the 
regular work, plus" inevitably seems punitive to them   (Tomlinson, 
1995a).    </P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
<H3>Characteristics of a Differentiated Class  </H3>

<P>Four characteristics shape teaching and learning in an effective 
differentiated classroom (Tomlinson, 1995a):  </P>
<OL Type=1>
<LI>  Instruction is concept focused and principle driven.  All students
have the  opportunity to explore and apply the key concepts of the 
subject being studied.  All students come to understand the key 
principles on which the study is based.  Such instruction enables 
struggling learners to grasp and use powerful ideas  and, at the same 
time, encourages advanced learners to expand their  understanding and 
application of the key concepts and principles.  Such  instruction 
stresses understanding or sense-making rather than retention and  
regurgitation of fragmented bits of information.  Concept-based and  
principle-driven instruction invites teachers to provide varied 
learning  options.  A "coverage-based" curriculum may cause a teacher 
to feel compelled to see that all students do the same work.  In the 
former, all students have the  opportunity to explore meaningful ideas
through a variety of avenues and  approaches. <BR><BR>

<LI>  On-going assessment of student readiness and growth are built 
into the  curriculum.  Teachers do not assume that all students need a
given task or  segment of study, but continuously assess student 
readiness and interest,  providing support when students need 
additional instruction and guidance, and  extending student 
exploration when indications are that a student or group of  students 
is ready to move ahead.    <BR><BR>

<LI> Flexible grouping is consistently used.  In a differentiated class,
students  work in many patterns.  Sometimes they work alone, sometimes
in pairs, sometimes in groups.  Sometimes tasks are readiness-based, 
sometimes interest-based,  sometimes constructed to match learning 
style, and sometimes a combination of  readiness, interest, and 
learning style.  In a differentiated classroom,  whole-group 
instruction may also be used for introducing new ideas, when  
planning, and for sharing learning outcomes.  <BR><BR>

<LI> Students are active explorers.  Teachers guide the exploration.  
Because  varied activities often occur simultaneously in a 
differentiated classroom, the  teacher works more as a guide or 
facilitator of learning than as a dispenser of  information.  As in a 
large family, students must learn to be responsible for  their own 
work.  Not only does such student-centeredness give students more  
ownership of their learning, but it also facilitates the important 
adolescent  learning goal of growing independence in thought, 
planning, and evaluation.   Implicit in such instruction is (1) 
goal-setting shared by teacher and student  based on student 
readiness, interest, and learning profile, and (2) assessment  
predicated on student growth and goal attainment.  <BR><BR>

<a name="How"></a>
<H3>How to Think About Differentiating Instruction  </H3>

<P>There are many ways to shake up the classroom to create a better fit 
for more  learners-including those who are advanced.  In general, 
interest-based  adjustments allow students to have a voice in deciding
whether they will apply  key principles being studied to 
math-oriented, literature-based, hobby-related,  science-oriented, or 
history-associated areas.  For example, in studying the  American 
Revolution, one student might opt to write a short story about the 
life of a teenager during the Revolutionary period.  Another might 
elect to apply key ideas about the American Revolution to an 
investigation of heroes then and now.  Yet another might prefer to 
study ways in which the Revolution affected the  development of 
science.</P>

  <P> Adjustments based on learning profile encourage 
students to understand  their own learning preferences.  For example, 
some students need a longer period to reflect on ideas before 
beginning to apply them, while others prefer quick  action.  Some 
students need to talk with others as they learn, while others need a 
quiet work space.  Some students learn best as they tell stories about
ideas  being explored, others as they create mind maps, and still 
others as they  construct three-dimensional representations.  Some 
students may learn best  through a practical application of ideas, 
others through a more analytical  approach.</P>

<P>        Readiness-based adjustments can be created by teachers 
offering students a range of learning tasks developed along one or 
more of the following continua:  </P>
<OL Type=1>
<LI>      Concrete to abstract.  Learners advanced in a subject often 
benefit from tasks that involve more abstract materials, 
representations, ideas, or  applications than less advanced peers.  <BR><BR>

<LI>     Simple to complex.  Learners advanced in a subject often 
benefit from  tasks that are more complex in resources, research, 
issues, problems, skills, or goals than less advanced peers.  <BR><BR>

<LI>      Basic to transformational.  Learners advanced in a subject 
often benefit from tasks that require greater transformation or 
manipulation of information,  ideas, materials, or applications than 
less advanced peers.  <BR><BR>

<LI>      Fewer facets to multi-facets.  Learners advanced in a subject 
often  benefit from tasks that have more facets or parts in their 
directions,  connections within or across subjects, or planning and 
execution than less  advanced peers.  <BR><BR>

<LI>      Smaller leaps to greater leaps.  Learners advanced in a 
subject often  benefit from tasks that require greater mental leaps in
insight, application, or transfer than less advanced peers.  <BR><BR>

<LI>      More structured to more open.  Learners advanced in a subject 
often  benefit from tasks that are more open in regard to solutions, 
decisions, and  approaches than less advanced peers. <BR><BR>

<LI>      Less independence to greater independence. Learners advanced 
in a  subject often benefit from greater independence in planning, 
designing, and  self-monitoring than less advanced peers.  <BR><BR>

<LI>      Quicker to slower.  Learners advanced in a subject will 
sometimes  benefit from rapid movement through prescribed materials 
and tasks.  At other  times, they may require a greater amount of time
with a given study than less  advanced peers so that they may explore 
the topic in greater depth and/or  breadth.  <BR><BR>

<H3>Final Thoughts  </H3>

<P>Teachers moving toward differentiated instruction in an inclusive, 
integrated  middle school classroom find greater success if they (1) 
have a clear rationale  for differentiation, (2) prepare students and 
parents for a differentiated  classroom, (3) attend to issues of 
classroom structure and management as they  move toward more 
student-centered learning, (4) move toward differentiation at a pace 
comfortable to both teacher and learners, and (5) plan with team 
members  and other colleagues interested in differentiation 
(Tomlinson, 1995b).    </P>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>How do teachers develop an instructional plan that will be
challenging, enlightening, and intriguing to students of different
abilities, and still maintain a sense of community within the
classroom? This is the central question for educators as they begin
the quest of bringing sound instruction to gifted students in regular
classroom settings.</P>

<P>Research tells us that a large majority of gifted and talented
students spend most of their day in regular classroom settings (Cox,
Daniel, &amp; Boston, 1985). Unfortunately, instruction in the regular
classroom setting is generally not tailored to meet their unique needs
(Archambault et al., 1993; Cox, Daniel, &amp; Boston, 1985; Westberg,
Archambault, Dobyns, &amp; Salvin, 1993). This situation is putting gifted
students at risk of failing to achieve their potential. Achievement
scores below what might be expected from our brightest population
provide the evidence (Callahan, 1990; Kantrowitz &amp; Wingert, 1992; Ness
&amp; Latessa, 1979).</P>

<P>The challenge for educators is twofold. Our gifted and talented
population must have a full service education if we expect these
students to thrive in the manner in which they are capable. Second,
these students must be involved in educational experiences that are
challenging and appropriate to their needs and achievement levels. The
place to begin is in the regular classroom.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Steps"></a>
<H3>What Are the Steps to Full Service?</H3>

<P>The goal for program planners dealing with the challenges of meeting
instructional needs of gifted and talented students in regular
classroom settings is to create a learning environment in which these
students can fully develop their abilities and interests without
losing their sense of membership as part of the class. This is a tall
order for teachers and students, because the usual remedy is to
segregate these students into small homogeneous groups or to assign
individual projects. While both of these strategies have their place,
neither is sufficient to accomplish the goal. Therefore, we must look
beyond the conventional, consider the overall dynamics of the
classroom, and plan for a working environment in which all the
students can fully develop their abilities and interests within the
confines of one organizational unit.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
<H3>What Are the Characteristics of Students Who Are Gifted and Talented?</H3>

<P>When asked this question, most teachers will respond by citing three
observations. First, gifted youngsters tend to get their work done
quickly and may seek further assignments or direction. Second, they
ask probing questions that tend to differ from their classmates in
depth of understanding and frequency. Finally, they have interests in
areas that are unusual or more like the interests of older students.
In fact, these observations define the characteristics that challenge
regular classroom teachers the most as they attempt to bring full
instructional service to gifted and talented students. These students
potentially differ from their classmates on three key dimensions
(Maker, 1982): (1) the pace at which they learn; (2) the depth of
their understanding; and (3) the interests that they hold. In order to
develop instructional programs that will meet the needs of gifted
students in regular classroom settings, it is necessary to address and
accommodate these defining characteristics.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Role"></a>
<H3>What Is the Role of the Regular Classroom Teacher?</H3>

<P>Most teachers have, on occasion, had students in their classes who
know more than they do about some specific topics they are teaching.
Teachers who see themselves as facilitators of learning can find a
great deal to offer these students. As a facilitator, orchestrator,
designer, or coach, the teacher presents the conditions for learning.
He or she helps the student develop the skills necessary to learn,
understand, and interpret an appropriately differentiated curriculum.
This role requires teachers to have skills in both their subject areas
(understanding its content, the manner in which its professionals
think) and in the management of learning.</P>

<H3>What Program Options Are Needed to Meet the Needs
of These Students?</H3>

<P>One of the greatest mistakes made by school districts attempting to
deliver programming to their gifted and talented students is that they
look for unidimensional approaches. The heterogeneity of the gifted
population leaves only one remedy that has any chance of succeeding
over the long haul. That is a multiple programming approach (Cox,
Daniel, &amp; Boston, 1985; Parke, 1989)--one in which a constellation of
programs is available in which students can participate based on their
abilities, needs, and interests. Some of these options may be
specifically tailored to high ability students (such as Advanced
Placement, honors, or resource room programs). Others may be found in
the course listings for general education that are available to all
students but which serve gifted and talented students well (such as
student council, school newspaper, Future Problem Solving, computer
club, etc.). Profiles of students' abilities, derived from
comprehensive assessment batteries, can be used to match students to
appropriate programs.</P>

<H3>What Instructional Provisions Must Be Made?</H3>

<P>Designing instructional opportunities for gifted students in regular
classrooms finds its inspiration at the source of the concern--the
students. The characteristics of these students lead to the
instructional accommodations that are appropriate (The Association for
Gifted, 1989). The accelerated pace at which gifted and talented
students learn information requires that flexible pacing strategies
(Daniel &amp; Cox, 1988) such as skill grouping, curricular compacting,
contracting, and credit by examination be integrated into classroom
management formats. The need to explore topics in depth leads program
planners to include provisions such as original research, independent
studies or investigations, mentorships, or classes at another school
or institution of higher learning. When addressing the unique or
advanced interests of these students, planners might be inspired to
include opportunities such as minicourses, interest groups, clubs,
science or art fairs, or internships. The teachers' challenge is to
identify student needs, develop and gain access to appropriate
programs and curricula that correspond to those needs, and monitor
student progress throughout the course of study. The students'
challenge is to make the best possible use of the resources available
while becoming fully responsible for their own learning.</P>

<LI>Have preestablished consequences for misbehavior.<BR><BR>

<LI>Administer consequences immediately, and monitor proper behavior
frequently.<BR><BR>

<LI>Enforce classroom rules consistently.<BR><BR>

<LI>Make sure the discipline fits the "crime," without harshness.<BR><BR>

<LI>Change rewards if they are not effective in motivating behavioral
change.<BR><BR>

<LI>Find ways to encourage the child.<BR><BR>

<LI>Teach the child to reward himself or herself. Encourage positive
self-talk (e.g., "You did very well remaining in your seat today. How
do you feel about that?"). This encourages the child to think
positively about himself or herself.<BR><BR>

<H3>Other Educational Recommendations</H3>



<P>Educational, psychological, and/or neurological testing to determine
learning style and cognitive ability and to rule out any learning
disabilities (common in about 30% of students with ADD).</P>

<P>A private tutor and/or peer tutoring at school.</P>

<P>A class that has a low student-teacher ratio.</P>

<P>Social skills training and organizational skills training.</P>

<P>Training in cognitive restructuring (positive "self-talk," e.g., "I
did that well.").</P>

<P>Use of a word processor or computer for schoolwork.</P>

<P>Individualized activities that are mildly competitive or
noncompetitive such as bowling, walking, swimming, jogging, biking,
karate. (Note: Children with ADD may do less well than their peers in
team sports.)</P>

<P>Involvement in social activities such as scouting, church groups, or
other youth organizations that help develop social skills and
self-esteem.</P>

<P>Allowing children with ADD to play with younger children if that is
where they fit in. Many children with ADD have more in common with
younger children than with their age-peers. They can still develop
valuable social skills from interaction with younger children.</P>

<P>Every year the National Information Center for Children and Youth with Disabilities (NICHCY) receives thousands of requests for information about the education and special needs of children and youth with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Over the past several years, ADD has received a tremendous amount of attention from parents, professionals, and policymakers across the country; so much so, in fact, that nearly everyone has now heard about ADD.</P>

<P>While helpful to those challenged by this disability, such widespread recognition creates the possibility of improper diagnostic practice and inappropriate treatment. Now, more than ever, parents who suspect their child might have ADD and parents of children diagnosed with the disorder need to evaluate information, products, and practitioners carefully.</P>

<P>This <B><I>NICHCY Briefing Paper</I></B> is intended to serve as a guide to help parents and educators know what ADD is, what to look for, and what to do. While acknowledging that adults, too, can have ADD, this paper focuses on the disorder as it relates to children and youth.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<a name="Definition"></a>
<HR>
<H3>Is ADD Something New?</H3>

<P>References to ADD-type symptoms have been found in the medical literature for almost 100 years. In fact, this syndrome is one of the most widely researched of all childhood disorders. Scientific experts have long understood ADD as a disability that can and does cause serious lifelong problems, particularly when nothing is done to manage the difficulties associated with the disorder.</P>

<P>Throughout all these years of research, the children with ADD have not changed. The characteristics of ADD evident 40 years ago are still the same seen today. It is our understanding of ADD that has evolved. The knowledge we have gained through research has, in fact, led to a change in the disorder's name and in </P>the way it is viewed.

<H3>What is Attention Deficit Disorder?</H3>

<P>ADD is officially called Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or AD/HD (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), although most lay people, and even some professionals, still call it ADD (the name given in 1980). The disorder's name has changed as a result of scientific advances and the findings of careful field trials; researchers now have strong evidence to support the position that AD/HD (as we will refer to the disorder throughout the remainder of this Briefing Paper) is not one specific c disorder with different variations. In keeping with this evidence, AD/HD is now divided into three subtypes, according to the main features associated with the disorder: inattentiveness, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. The three subtypes are:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> AD/HD Predominantly Combined Type,<BR><BR>

	<LI> AD/HD Predominantly Inattentive Type, and<BR><BR>

	<LI> AD/HD Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type. These subtypes take into account that some children with AD/ HD have little or no trouble sitting still or inhibiting behavior, but may be predominantly inattentive and, as a result, have great difficulty getting or staying focused on a task or activity. Others with AD/HD may be able to pay attention to a task but lose focus because they may be predominantly  hyperactive-impulsive and, thus, have trouble controlling impulse and activity. The most prevalent subtype is the Combined Type. These children will have significant symptoms of all three characteristics.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P><B><I>"Maybe you know my kid. He's the ore who says the first thing that comes to mind. He's the youngster who can't remember a simple request. When he scrapes his knee, he screams so load and long that the neighbors think I am beating him. He's the kid in school with arts in his parts who could do the work if he really tried. Or so his parents have been told over and over again."</I></B></P>

<P>From Mary Fowler's (1993), <I>Maybe you know my kid: A parent's guide to identifying, understanding, and helping your child with ADHD</I> (2nd ed.) Used  with permission.</P>

<H3>Defining Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder*</H3>

<P>Instead of a single list of 14 possible symptoms as listed in the prior edition of the DSM (the DSM-III-R), the DSM -IV categorically sorts the symptoms into three subtypes of the disorder:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> Combined Type: multiple symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity;<BR><BR>

	<LI> Predominantly Inattentive Type: multiple symptoms of inattention with few, if any, of hyperactivity-impulsivity;<BR><BR>

	<LI> Predominantly Hyperactive:Impulsive Type/multiple symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity with few, if any, of inattention.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>Other essential diagnostic features of AD/HD include:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> Symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity must persist for at least six months and be maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental levels;<BR><BR>

	<LI> Some of the symptoms causing impairment must he present before age 7 years;<BR><BR>

	<LI> Some impairment from the symptoms is present in two or more settings (e.g., at school/work, and at home);<BR><BR>

	<LI> Evidence of clinically significant impairment is present in social, academic, or occupational functioning;<BR><BR>

	<LI> Symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Schizophrenia, or other Psychotic Disorder and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Mood Disorder, Anxiety disorder, Dissociative Disorder, or Personality Disorder).<BR><BR>

<HR>

<H3>Don't All Children Show These Signs Occasionally?</H3>

<P>From time to time, all children will be inattentive, impulsive, and overly active. In the case of AD/ HD, <I>these behaviors are the rule. not the exception</I>. When a child exhibits the behaviors listed above as symptomatic of AD/HD, even if he or she does so consistently, do not draw the conclusion that the child has the disorder. <B>Until a proper evaluation is completed, you can only <I>assume</I> that the child <I>might</I> have AD/HD</B>.</P>

<P>Conversely, people have been known to read symptom lists and, finding one or two exceptions, rule out the possibility of the disorder's presence. AD/HD is a disability that, without proper identification and management, can have long-term complications. Parents and teachers are cautioned against making the diagnosis by themselves.</P>

<p>
The HEATH Resource Center has recently received a number of requests for 
information on issues associated with postsecondary education for 
individuals with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).  In order to collect 
information on this emerging topic, the HEATH staff contacted Chesapeake 
Psychological Services, one of several Washington, DC metropolitan area 
resources offering comprehensive testing and follow-up support to 
individuals with varying types of disabilities.  Chesapeake Psychological 
Services has an Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Clinic, which offers 
a full range of treatment services - from educational recommendations to 
consultation with physicians. As a result of that contact, Dr. Susan Biggs and 
Dr. Kathleen Nadeau on staff at Chesapeake Psychological Services accepted 
the invitation to present a professional development program to the 
members of  the Nation's Capital Area Disability Support Services Coalition.  
What follows is a summary of the Biggs-Nadeau presentation in December 
1992. </p>

<a name="Defining"></a>
<H3>Defining ADD</H3>
<p>
The basic characteristics of adults with ADD include inattention and 
impulsivity.  Adults with ADD may be disorganized, may lose things 
frequently, and may be easily distracted from the task-at-hand.  Impulsiveness  may include a perceived need to move on immediately to a new task, thus  leaving another unfinished (they may be enthusiastic beginners but poor  completers); impatience in waiting situations, such as in stalled traffic or  standing in a slow-moving line;  a short temper; or the tendency to respond  poorly to stress and thus become easily hassled. </p>

<p>The education community divides ADD, by definition, into two similar yet 
slightly different groups.  Individuals may be defined as having either ADD 
- Attention Deficit Disorder, or ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder, or attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity.  Adults with ADD 
or ADHD may be either slow and lethargic, or restless and fidgety.  Medical 
researchers now believe that differences in chemistry in the parts of the brain  which control inhibition may cause ADD, and may be inherited.</p>

<a name="Historical"></a>
<H3>Historical Trends</H3>
<p>Medical and educational researchers over the past century have addressed 
various aspects of attention-related disability.  In the early 1900's,  attention- related patterns and behavior problems following brain injury were the focus  of research.  During the 1930's and 1940's, attention-related characteristics  among individuals who had not sustained brain injury or brain damage were  recognized and studied.  Our knowledge became much more defined in the  1960's, with the awareness of some of the components that play a part in an attention-related disability, such as learning disabilities, neurologic dysfunction, or behavioral symptoms.  More precision regarding the 
definition of behavioral characteristics became possible in the 1970's.  Finally,  in the 1980's, the definition of ADD was included in the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of the Mental Disorders (DSM-III).  The DSM-III is the 
official glossary of descriptions of mental health diagnosis.  The addition of 
ADD to the DSM-III led to wide recognition of it as a specific disorder.
</p>

<a name="ADD"></a>
<H3>ADD and Adults</H3>
<p>
It is becoming clear that ADD is not a disability limited to childhood or 
adolescence.  More and more adults are discovering that they have ADD; 
current estimates are that between eight and 15 million American adults 
have the disability.  It is a high frequency and low visibility disability, 
meaning that many individuals have the disability, but its characteristics are 
not readily apparent. </p>
<p>
Some report that between one-third and one-half of children with ADD grow 
up to be adults with ADD.  While adults may be more likely to have an 
attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity, the adult will likely continue 
to experience difficulties with concentration; achieving his or her potential; 
impulsivity; behavior problems at home, school, or work; or will use poor 
judgment or have self-destructive tendencies.  Adults with ADD often 
present additional diagnoses as well, such as mild chronic depression, mood 
and energy swings, nervousness, sleep disorders, muscular tension, and/or 
learning disabilities. </p>

<p>The presence within a person of an ADD is pervasive.  It is more likely to 
affect many, or all, of an individual's life areas, rather than just one isolated 
area.  As a result, adults with ADD may experience difficulties with most life 
issues.  Some adults may be unable to complete formal education or may do 
so only with overwhelming drive.  Others may have trouble with 
interpersonal relationships.  Career problems may be present for others with 
ADD.  Career-related problems may stem from frequent job terminations 
because of poor job performance, attention and/or organization problems, 
interpersonal problems with supervisors and/or co-workers, or becoming 
easily bored and quitting a job.  Regardless of the life area in which  an adult 
with ADD is experiencing difficulties, each is likely to feel that he or she is not 
living up to his or her potential.  For relief, some may turn to intense 
physical or mental activity; others may use drugs or alcohol for self-
medication.

<a name="Diagnosis"></a>
<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
<p>Psycho-educational  diagnosticians use a system similar to the six steps 
described below when evaluating for ADD or ADHD. </p>
  
<ol><li><h4>Understanding Current Concerns and History</h4> 
<p>Diagnosticians interview the student, and possibly his or her family in order 
to garner as much information as possible.  Given the field's emerging 
knowledge about heredity and ADD, a diagnostician may look for clues to 
indicate if characteristics were present early in an individual's life, regardless 
of whether or not the individual and/or his or her family were identified as 
having any of the characteristics of this disability. </p>

<p>Some diagnosticians develop a questionnaire, such as one described by Biggs 
and Nadeau, during this phase of the evaluation process to elicit information 
about ADD or ADHD.  Such questions as "Do you feel that you are 
organized?", or "Would you describe for me your method of organization?" 
begin to provide diagnosticians with useful insights.  Throughout the 
individual's responses, the diagnostician looks for evidence that ADD 
characteristics seem to be present in situations both in and out of the school 
or campus environment.  Questions are asked to discover the areas affected by 
ADD including reading and writing skills, mathematics, attention and 
concentration abilities, language processing, visual and spatial abilities, 
memory, processing speed, social skills, and general concerns. </p>

<li><h4>Selecting Appropriate Measures to Address Concerns</h4>
<p>Diagnosticians select tests from a large inventory of assessment tools.  The  selection is based on questions raised from the client's history.  For example,  during the evaluation process, a diagnostician may administer tests which 
will produce information about the possibilities of ADD or ADHD, learning 
disabilities, emotional problems, and/or neurological issues. </p>

<li><h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
Since each individual is unique, there is no pre-determined number of tests 
that a psychlogist or psychiatrist may administer in order to assess for ADD or 
ADHD.  
The assessments usually cover the following areas: intelligence, 
cognitive/information processing, personality, and educational - if learning 
disability is suspected. </p>

<li><h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>
During this stage of the evaluation process, the diagnosticians "play 
detective" and "put clues together." </P>
  
<li><h4>Treatment Planning Conference</h4>
<p>
The treatment planning conference always includes the diagnostician and the 
student, but may also include parents, spouse, and/or an educational 
specialist.  In the conference, test results are shared and interpreted and 
recommendations are discussed.  These may include specific 
recommendations to the student regarding study skills, and 
recommendations to the college regarding needed supports and 
accommodations.  It may include recommendations for a medication 
evaluation, for psychological counseling, and/or for tutoring.  School 
placement issues may be discussed if the student is not satisfied with his or 
her current school.  For a working adult, both school and career issues may be 
discussed. </p>

<li><h4>Written Report</h4>
<p>
The diagnostician completes a full written report, including sections that list 
the tests which were given and the scores obtained, the interpretation of those 
scores, and individualized educational recommendations based on the 
students strengths and weaknesses.  Students should review the report 
thoroughly and ask any questions that they may have, or ask for the 
diagnostician to go over the report with them.  Most diagnosticians will 
schedule a follow-up appointment with the student, after he or she has 
received the written report and has had a chance to review it.  It is extremely 
important that the student understand the full contents of the report, as such 
an understanding will help the student advocate for his or her future needs.  
In addition, students should always keep a copy of the report, as well as any 
other relevant information, for their personal reference or future need. </p>
</ol>

<p>Costs of thorough evaluations, such as the six-step process described above, do 
vary and students are encouraged to become familiar with all options 
available to them before making a final choice.  Students should also check 
with their health insurance companies to see if such an evaluation is covered 
under their policy.</p>

<H3>Relevance to Campus Disability Support Services</H3>
<p>College Offices for Disability Support Services are likely to see an increase in 
requests for services for students with ADD or ADHD.  The disability is now 
recognized in the K-12 school system and public awareness about it has been 
raised by popular media. Accommodations commonly provided by colleges 
and universities, based on the student's functional limitations, include 
extending time to complete exams or papers; using notetakers, tutors, or 
organizational supports; carrying reduced courseloads; and preferential 
registration for smaller classes. </p>

<li><p>ADD and the College Student -A Guide for High School and College 
Students with Attention Deficit Disorder (1994), by Patricia O. Quinn, M.D. 
(editor), is a 113-page compilation of user-friendly information. While ADD 
and the College Student begins by stating that it has been written for high 
school juniors and seniors and college students with attention deficit disorder  (ADD), a diverse audience can benefit from the collection of easy-to-read 
practical advice, including adults who suspect that they may have ADD, 
family members of individuals with ADD, postsecondary service providers, 
psychologists, diagnosticians, vocational rehabilitation workers, as well as 
high school teachers and college counselors. <br><br>
The first half of this 12-chapter book answers commonly asked quesitons, lists 
the major symptoms of ADD, and contains a checklist that can be used to help 
evaluate various symptoms, gain self-awareness, and provide guidance 
regarding the necessity of seeking a professional assessment. The 
biochemistry of ADD, medication, and other treatments for ADD also are 
covered. While Dr. Quinn states that she cannot endorse any of the 
alternative therapies at this point in time, she explains the basics of 
biofeedback therapy, self-control or cognitive therapy, and diet and 
megavitamin therapy. How ADD Affects You focuses on the most common 
issues faced by adolescents with ADD, both academic and social, and ends 
with personal commentaries from two college students with ADD. <br><br>

The second half of ADD and the College Student begins with Preparing for 
College: A Mother's Perspective. This personal story concludes with helpful 
hints for college students with ADD and for their parents. The remainder of 
the book leads readers through senior year at high school, college programs, 
and accommodations for students with ADD. The support services that 
postsecondary students with ADD may find helpful are described. Dr. Quinn 
points out that students can best understand which support services may be 
most helpful to them only after they understand their own learning strengths 
and weaknesses. She discusses common academic and emotional difficulties 
and then goes on to offer suggested accommodations. Quinn explains the 
three major sources from which the rights of college students with ADD 
stem: the Constitution, statues and regulations that prohibit discrimination, 
and cases decided by the courts. ADD and the College Student concludes with 
Commonly Asked Questions, which cover medicaiton, treatment programs, 
college admission and SAT's, parent involvement, learning 
accommodations, and legal issues. References to other relevant publications 
and organizations also are provided, as are the definitions of ADHD 
(Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder) used by both the American 
Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
ADD and the College Student is available from MAGINATION PRESS, 19 
Union Square West, New York, NY 10003. (800) 825-3089. The cost is $13.95, 
plus a shipping and handling fee of $2.75.

</p>

<li><p>Approaching College for the Student with ADD is one in a series of videos 
that seeks to inform students with ADD and their parents about the paths to 
success in college. In Approaching College for the Student with ADD, Dr. 
Patricia Quinn dispels the myth that ADD students could do better in school if 
only they tried harder. Quinn argues that many of these students already are 
putting considerable effort into their studies, and that for student with ADD, 
they key to success lies in developing and putting into practice strategies for 
time management, considering medication options, and continuing to seek 
supportive services. In the video, Quinn cautions students that the transition 
from high school and home to college involves enough major changes 
without making a clean break from medication or deciding to "turn over a 
new leaf" by attempting to handle course work without support services. 
Comments from Quinn are augmented by the remarks of several students 
with ADD, whose advice lends a "front  lines" pragmatism to the video. 
These students recount experiences with teachers and administrators and 
offer suggestions for effectively discussing the need for special 
accommodations. </p>

<li><p>In ADD and the College Student, another video in the series, Quinn provides 
a comprehensive list of personality traits associated with attention deficit 
disorder. For someone recently diagnosed with ADD, or for someone who 
suspects the presence of ADD, Quinn's overview of the disability is 
particularly informative. Her description of the disability emphasizes the 
increased tasks and responsibilities of personal care and academic workload 
that are associated with college life. Quinn's assessment provides a positive 
framework for understanding the disability and for developing strategies for 
the college student with ADD. <br><br>
Ann McCormick, an advisor at the American University (Washington, DC), 
follows Dr. Quinn's discussion of symptoms with examples of 
accommodations that her office commonly employs in providing for the 
needs of students with ADD. McCormick provides practical advice on 
choosing a college, and her presentation on accommodations is helpful in 
that it prepares a student with ADD for the kind of dialogue that must take 
place for an effective accommodation program to be developed. This 
discussion includes pragmatic strategies that a student with ADD can employ 
to improve his or her chances of succeeding in a college environment.
The cost of each video is $29.95. To order, prepay the Pediatric Development 
Center, 3262 Arcadia Place, NW, Washington, D.C. 20015. (202) 966-1561.
</p>

<li><p>The ABC's of ADD (1993) is a 30-minute videotape that contains basic 
information for adults with ADD, those who suspect they have ADD, family 
members of individuals with ADD, or any of the many professionals who 
may be interested in the issues associated with adults with ADD. The adult 
focus of the video is conveyed from the start of the tape, which begins with 
snippets of personal stories told by three young adults with ADD and 
segments from various professionals speaking to an audience at an earlier 
conference. <br><br>
Each section is brief, conveying basic information. First, the primary 
symptoms of ADD, including some of the most characteristic symptoms of 
both children and adults with ADD, are discussed. The video expands upon 
this discussion by presenting characteristic secondary symptoms of 
individuals with ADD. Each of the medications most commonly prescribed to 
individuals with ADD is discussed briefly and some of the common side-
effects of the various medications are mentioned. The young adults with 
ADD who appeared at the beginning of the video tell longer versions of their 
own personal stories, touching on issues associated with postsecondary 
education and employment. Common characteristics of adults with ADD also 
are presented in a personal story format. A section on legal rights concludes 
the tape, briefly laying a foundation for understanding the legislation that has 
helped prevent discrimination against individuals with disabilities.
The ABC's of ADD is available from JKL Communications, P.O. Box 41057, 
Washington, DC 20016. The cost is $29.

<P>RIVERHEAD, N.Y., April 10 -- An increasing body of evidence supports diet as an effective treatment for ADD and ADHD according to the Feingold Association of the United States. Persistent hyperactivity and difficulty paying attention are among symptoms commonly associated with these disorders.</P>

<P>According to the Feingold Association, a non-profit organization supporting a dietary approach to these problems, nearly four million children in this country are affected. Three million have been prescribed amphetamine-like drugs, such as Ritalin.</P>

<P>"Many of them can be helped by simply avoiding eating certain food chemicals. Changing brands, not necessarily the child's diet, can help them to avoid having to rely on powerful drugs," says Feingold Association President, Pat Palmer.</P>

<P>According to immunologist Robert Sinaiko, MD, "The research connecting diet and behavior often goes unread. For two decades, the scientific literature and parents have noted that certain synthetic, petroleum-based food additives act like drugs on certain children, impairing learning and triggering symptoms which look exactly like ADD and ADHD."</P>

<P>He cites a number of studies based on double-blind, placebo-
controlled food challenges published in major scientific journals such as Science and the Lancet. "These and others prove that learning or behavior in certain children is significantly impaired for several hours following the ingestion of artificial food colors," according to Sinaiko.</P>

<P>"Many children could truly benefit from this information but it is being ignored in favor of drug therapy. Unfortunately, drugs have side effects and medicating the child doesn't cure anything. Any root causes often will persist through adulthood if not addressed. It's time we physicians saved recommending drug therapy as a last resort," says Sinaiko.</P>

<P>Dr. Sinaiko and the Feingold Association echo the concern recently announced by the United Nation's International Narcotics Control Board. The U.N. board is alarmed that effective and proven non-drug treatments may be ignored and addictive psychostimulant medications like Ritalin and the amphetamines are being over-used in this country.</P>

<P>"In many cases, the treatment depends more on the practitioner than on the symptoms presented,' says Jane Hersey, author of Why Can't My Child Behave&#63; She continues, 'A psychologist will focus on family dynamics; an allergist will prefer allergy testing; a doctor who favors drugs will provide a prescription, and one who favors diet will suggest the family consult the Feingold Association."</P>

<P>"Diet is, by far, the least expensive alternative," says Hersey. "It also is risk-free. If diet is not sufficient, a parent can then explore other options."</P>

<P>"Some parents feel their child needs both diet and medication. We don't judge parents' decisions or add more pressure to them," states Palmer. "We just want parents and physicians to know that diet therapy is another option for treating behavior and attention problems. Parents have that right."</P>

<P>The Feingold Association offers a free brochure by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope to F.A.U.S., 127 E. Main St., No. 106, Riverhead, NY 11901. </P>

<H3>Suggested Interventions  </H3>





<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>       Teach metacognitive strategies.  Teach children similarities

and differences between speech sounds and visual patterns across
words.<BR><BR>

<LI>      Provide direct instruction in language analysis and the
alphabetic code.  Give explicit instruction in segmenting and blending
speech sounds.  Teach children to process progressively larger chunks
of words.<BR><BR>

<LI>        Use techniques that make phonemes more concrete.  For example,
phonemes and syllables can be represented with blocks where children
can be taught how to add, omit, substitute, and rearrange phonemes in
words.<BR><BR>

<LI>        Make the usefulness of metacognitive skills explicit in
reading.  Have children practice them.  Try modeling skills in various
reading contexts.  Review previous reading lessons and relate to
current lessons.<BR><BR>

<LI>        Discuss the specific purposes and goals of each reading
lesson. Teach children how metacognitive skills should be applied.<BR><BR>

<LI>        Provide regular practice with reading materials that are
contextually meaningful.  Include many words that children can decode.
Using books that contain many words children cannot decode may lead to
frustration and guessing, which is counterproductive.<BR><BR>

<LI>       Teach for automaticity.  As basic decoding skills are
mastered, regularly expose children to decodable words so that these
words become automatically accessible.  As a core sight vocabulary is
acquired, expose children to more irregular words to increase reading
accuracy.  Reading-while-listening and repeated reading are useful
techniques for developing fluency.<BR><BR>

<LI>       Teach for comprehension.  Try introducing conceptually
important vocabulary prior to initial reading and have children retell
the story and answer questions regarding implicit and explicit
content.  Teach children the main components of most stories (i.e.,
character, setting, etc.) and how to identify and use these components
to help them remember the story.<BR><BR>

<LI>       Teach reading and spelling in conjunction.  Teach children the
relationship between spelling and reading and how to correctly spell
the words they read.<BR><BR>

<LI>        Provide positive explicit and corrective feedback.  Reinforce
attempts as well as successes.  Direct instruction and teacher-child
interactions should be emphasized.<BR><BR>

<P>/ADVANCE/ BETHESDA, Md., July 3 /PRNewswire/ -- Brain imaging studies at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) have revealed dramatic evidence of a deficit in the brain's visual system in people with dyslexia, a disorder that affects the reading ability of millions of American school children and adults. While it has been commonly believed that only the language-related areas of the brain are affected in dyslexia, this study adds to the growing body of research pointing to dysfunction of another portion of the brain known as V5/MT.</P>

<P>Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), NIH scientists Guinevere Eden, D.Phil., and colleagues demonstrated in a small controlled study of adult males that people with dyslexia showed no activation in the V5/MT brain area, which specializes in movement perception. Dr. Eden's research confirms that people with dyslexia, hobbled by problems with reading, writing, and spelling, have trouble processing specific visual information. "We found that maps of brain activity measured while subjects were given a visual task of looking at moving dots were very different in individuals with dyslexia compared to normal control subjects," said Dr. Eden.</P>

<P>The eight control subjects showed robust activity in brain region V5/MT when viewing a moving dot pattern. Almost no activity was present in those areas in people with dyslexia. In fact, a clear finding in all six subjects showing no response in the V5/MT area is a step toward improving the understanding, diagnosis, and eventually, treatment for the disorder.</P>

<P>"This research confirms that dyslexia is a discrete brain disorder, not, as some people have believed, a by-product of a poor education or upbringing," said NIMH Director Steven H. Hyman, M.D. Furthermore, if confirmed by additional research, functional brain imaging may be used as a tool for early and accurate diagnosis of this common and disabling disorder.</P>

<P>Whether the motion perception deficit uncovered by this study contributes to the reading disability characteristic of dyslexia is still unknown. It is possible that the visual disturbances we found and the reading disturbances others have found may be caused by an underlying, common information processing deficit," said Dr. Eden. According to the research team, the anatomical changes underlying these functional differences are thought to occur during the early stages of development, when regional functional specialization occurs. Abnormal function in the specialized brain area V5/MT explains previously reported visual behavioral problems in dyslexia.</P>

<P>Future research will provide further insights into the details of visual end language deficits and their effects on reading. Dr. Eden's study suggests a broader definition of the underlying mechanisms of dyslexia, thus opening the way for development of special help and effective treatment for more people with the disorder.</P>

<P>All of the dyslexic subjects in this study had a childhood history of reading disability, a measurable reading deficit, a discrepancy of at least 2 standard deviations between their reading and verbal IO, and poorer phonological awareness compared to controls, and none had neurological disorders. Normal controls were closely matched to dyslexics in age, education, socioeconomic status, and IQ.</P>

<P>The technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging is based on the principle that blood flow, rich in oxygen, increases locally in active areas of the brain. Usually used to obtain information on structural details of the brain, EMRI can also pinpoint regions where oxygenation levels are changing as a result of neural activity. The procedure is noninvasive, as it exploits a magnetic tracer, namely hemoglobin, that is a normal constituent of blood.</P>

<P>The study, "Abnormal Processing of visual Motion Processing in Dyslexia Revealed by Functional Brain Imaging," was published July 4 in Nature. Co-authors are Judith M. Rumsey, Ph.D., and Jose Ma. Masog, M.D., of NIMH, Thomas A. Zeffiro, M.D., Ph.D., and John W. VanMeter, Ph.D., of Sensor Systems, Inc., and Roger Woods, M.D., of U.C.L.A.</P>

<H3>Definition of Learning Disabilities</H3>
 
<P>     The regulations for Public Law (P.L.) 101-476, the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), formerly P.L.
94-142, the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA),  define a
learning disability as a "disorder in one or more of the basic
psychological processes involved in understanding or in using
spoken or written language, which may manifest itself in an
imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell or
to do mathematical calculations."</P>

<P>     The Federal definition further states that learning
disabilities include "such conditions as perceptual disabilities,
brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and
developmental aphasia."  According to the law, learning
disabilities do not include learning problems that are
primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor disabilities;
mental retardation; or environmental,cultural, or economic
disadvantage.  Definitions of learning disabilities also vary
among states.</P>

<P>     Having a single term to describe this category of children
with disabilities reduces some of the confusion, but there are
many conflicting theories about what causes learning disabilities
and how many there are.  The label "learning disabilities" is
all-embracing; it describes a syndrome, not a specific child with
specific problems.  The definition assists in classifying
children, not teaching them.  Parents and teachers need to
concentrate on the individual child. They need to observe both
how and how well the child performs, to assess strengths and
weaknesses, and develop ways to help each child learn.  It is
important to remember that there is a high degree of
interrelationship and overlapping among the areas of learning. 
Therefore,children with learning disabilities may exhibit a
combination of characteristics. </P>

<P>     These problems may mildly, moderately, or severely impair
the learning process.</P>

<a name="Incidence"></a>
<H3> Incidence</H3> 

<P>     Many different estimates of the number of children with
learning disabilities have appeared in the literature (ranging
from 1% to 30% of the general population).  In 1987, the
Interagency Committee on Learning Disabilities concluded that 5%
to 10% is a reasonable estimate of the percentage of persons
affected by learning disabilities.  The U.S. Department of
Education (1994) reported that more than 4% of all school aged
children received special education services for learning
disabilities and that in the 1992-93 school year over 2 million
children with learning disabilities were served.  Differences in
estimates perhaps reflect variations in the definition.</P>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
 <H3>Characteristics</H3> 

<P>     Learning disabilities are characterized by a significant
difference in the child's achievement in some areas, as compared
to his or her overall intelligence.</P>

<P>     Students who have learning disabilities may exhibit a wide
range of traits, including problems with reading comprehension,
spoken language, writing, or reasoning ability. Hyperactivity,
inattention, and perceptual coordination problems may also be
associated with learning disabilities.  Other traits that may be
present include a variety of symptoms, such as uneven and
unpredictable test performance, perceptual impairments, motor
disorders, and behaviors such as impulsiveness, low tolerance for
frustration, and problems in handling day-to-day social
interactions and situations.</P>

<P>     Learning disabilities may occur in the following academic
areas:</P>

<ol>
     	<LI>   Spoken language: Delays, disorders, or discrepancies in
          	listening and speaking
     	<LI>   Written language: Difficulties with reading, writing,
          	and spelling
     	<LI>   Arithmetic: Difficulty in performing arithmetic
          	functions or in comprehending
          	basic concepts
     	<LI>   Reasoning: Difficulty in organizing and integrating
          	thoughts
     	<LI>   Organization skills:  Difficulty in organizing all
          	facets of learning<BR><BR>
	</ol>

<a name="Educational"></a> 
 <H3>Educational Implications</H3> 

<P>     Because learning disabilities are manifested in a variety of
behavior patterns, the Individual Education Program (IEP) must be
designed carefully.  A team approach is important for educating
the child with a learning disability, beginning with the
assessment process and continuing through the development of the
IEP.  Close collaboration among special class teachers, parents,
resource room teachers, regular class teachers, and others will
facilitate the overall development of a child with learning
disabilities.</P>

<P>     Some teachers report that the following strategies have been
effective with some students who have learning disabilities:</P>

<ul>
     <li>    Capitalize on the student's strengths 
     <li>    Provide high structure and clear expectations 
     <li>    Use short sentences and a simple vocabulary 
     <li>    Provide opportunities for success in a supportive
          atmosphere to help build self-esteem 
     <li>    Allow flexibility in classroom procedures (e.g.,
          allowing the use of tape recorders for note-taking and
          test-taking when students have trouble with       
          written language) 
     <li>    Make use of self-correcting materials, which provide
          immediate feedback
          without embarrassment 
     <li>    Use computers for drill and practice and teaching word
          processing 
     <li>    Provide positive reinforcement of appropriate social
          skills at school and home 
     <li>    Recognize that students with learning disabilities can
          greatly benefit from the gift of time to grow and
          mature <BR><BR>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), Russ Berrie and Company Inc. of Oakland, N.J., is
recalling about 67,600 hand-shaped, five wick Glowing Gore Halloween
candles and about 17,600 hand-shaped, five wick Dem Bones Halloween
candles. The hand-shaped wax candles generate high flames that may
present a fire hazard.</P>

<P>The Dem Bones and Glowing Gore wax candles are hand shaped with five
fingers each having individual wicks. The candle flames may reach 10
inches high as the candles melt down to the palm with the wicks of the
five fingers burning together  Russ Berrie and Company has received no
reports of excess flames or injuries associated with the Glowing Gore and
Dem Bones Halloween candles. This recall is being conducted to prevent
injuries and fires.</P>

<P>The hand-shaped Glowing Gore wax candle is skin-toned and red colored with
candle wicks in each finger. The Dem Bones wax candle is pale green and
dark green colored with candle wicks in each finger. Both candles are 7.5
inches high with labels on the plastic wrapping under the hand
reading either, "DEM BONES ...DRIPPING OOZE CANDLE," or "GLOWING GORE
..DRIPPING BLOOD CANDLE."</P>

<P>Specialty gift stores, drug stores, and some grocery stores sold the
candles nationwide (the Glowing Gore wax candle from March 1994 to October
1996 and the Dem Bones candles beginning March 1996) for about $6.  </P>

<P>Consumers should immediately stop using the hand shaped Glowing Gore and
Dem Bones five wick wax candles and return them to the place of purchase
for a refund of the purchase price. For more information consumers should
call Russ Berrie and Company Inc. at (800) 272-7877.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
More children die from injuries than any other cause. The good news is that most
injuries can be prevented by following simple safety guidelines. Talk with your
doctor or other health care provider about ways to protect your child from injuries.
Fill out this safety checklist.</P>

<br>
<center>
<H3>Safety Guidelines Checklist </H3>
</center>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Read the list below and check off each guideline that your family already follows.
Work on those you don't.</P>

<H3>FOR ALL AGES:</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Use smoke detectors in your home. Change the batteries every year and check
to see that they work once a month.

	<LI>Keeping a gun in your home can be dangerous. If you do, make sure that the
gun and ammunition are locked up separately and kept out of reach.

	<LI>Never drive after drinking alcohol.

	<LI>Teach your child traffic safety. Children under 9 years of age need
supervision when crossing streets.

	<LI>Learn basic life-saving skills (CPR). 

	<LI>Keep a bottle of ipecac at home to treat poisoning. Talk with a doctor or the
local Poison Control Center before using it. Post the Poison Control Center number
near your telephone and write it in the space provided on the inside front cover. 
</UL>

<BR>

<H3>INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN:</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Use a car safety seat at all times until your child weighs at least 40
pounds. When possible, secure it in the center of the back seat. 

	<LI>Keep medicines, cleaning solutions, and other dangerous substances in
childproof containers, locked up and out of reach. 

	<LI>Use safety gates across stairways (top and bottom) and guards on windows
above the first floor. 

	<LI>Keep hot water heater temperatures below 120&#176; F. 

	<LI>Keep unused electrical outlets covered with plastic guards.</P>

	<LI>Baby walkers can be dangerous. Children using them should be closely
supervised. Access should be blocked to stairways and to objects that can fall (such
as lamps) or cause burns (such as stoves). 

	<LI>Keep objects and foods that can cause choking away from your child, such as
coins, balloons, small toy parts, hot dogs (unmashed), peanuts, and hard candies. 

	<LI>Use fences that go all the way around pools and keep gates to pools locked. 
</UL>

<br>

<H3>A SPECIAL MESSAGE ABOUT SIDS </H3>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of death for infants. Some
authorities believe that placing sleeping infants on the side or back, instead of the
stomach, decreases the risk of SIDS.</P>

<BR>

<H3>FOR OLDER CHILDREN:</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Use car safety belts at all times. Use with a booster seat if your child
weighs less than 70 lbs. The lap belt should be snug and low on the hips. The
shoulder belt should cross the chest, not the face, neck, or stomach. If it does not
fit properly, tuck it behind the shoulders instead. 

	<LI>Make sure your child uses a safety helmet while riding on a bicycle or
motorcycle. 

	<LI>Make sure your child uses protective equipment (such as mouth guards, pads,
sports goggles, and helmets) when playing contact sports, rollerskating, or
skateboarding.

	<LI>Don't let your child use alcohol or illegal drugs. Many driving-, sports-,
and violence- related injuries are caused by the use of alcohol or drugs. 

	<LI>Read all instructions for safe handling of household tools, such as saws and
lawn mowers. Teach your child to use these tools safely. 

	<LI>Don't allow your child to ride on or drive heavy farm equipment, such as
tractors, without special training. 

	<LI>Teach your child to deal with anger and conflict without using violence. Set
a good example for your child.

<H3>Section 4: Toys They Play With ... </H3>



<P>     Teach children to play safely by showing them how to use
their toys in a safe manner and by teaching them to put their
toys away after play.      </P>
<P>     Be particularly aware of safe and unsafe toys.  These
are some toy dangers you should be aware of:  </P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	


<LI>  SMALL PARTS.
     Tiny toys and toys with small removable parts can be
swallowed or become lodged in a child's throat, windpipe, ears or
nose. The seams of poorly constructed stuffed dolls or animals
can break open and release small pellets that can be swallowed or
inhaled.  <BR><BR>

<LI> SHARP EDGES. <BR>
     Toys of brittle plastic or glass can be broken easily,
leaving dangerous, sharp, cutting edges.  Metal and plastic
toys sometimes have sharp edges due to poor construction.  <BR><BR>

<LI> SHARP POINTS. <BR>
     Broken toys can expose dangerous prongs and knifelike
sharp points.  Pins and staples on dolls' clothes, hair and
accessories can easily puncture an unsuspecting child.  <BR><BR>

<LI> LOUD NOISES.  <BR>
     Toy caps and some noise-making guns and other toys can
produce sounds at noise levels that can damage hearing.  Do not
allow children to fire cap guns closer than one foot to the ear;
also, do not use indoors.  <BR><BR>

<LI>  PROPELLED OBJECTS. <BR>
     Projectiles -- guided missiles and similar flying toys --
can be turned into weapons and can injure eyes in particular.
Children should never be permitted to play with adult lawn darts
or other hobby or sporting equipment that have sharp points.
Arrows or darts used by children should have soft cork tips,
rubber suction cups or other protective tips intended to prevent
injury.  Teach children that these toys should never be aimed at
people or pets.  <BR><BR>

<LI>  ELECTRIC TOYS. <BR>
     Electric toys that are improperly constructed, wired or used
can shock or burn.  Electric toys with heating elements are only
recommended for children over eight years old.  Children should
be taught to use electric toys cautiously and under adult
supervision. <BR><BR>

<LI>  WRONG TOY FOR THE WRONG AGE.  <BR>
     Toys that may be safe for older children -- like a chemistry
or hobby set or games with small pieces -- can be extremely
dangerous in the hands of little ones.<BR><BR>

<LI>  CORDS AND STRINGS.  <BR>
     Toys with long strings or cords may be dangerous for infants
and very young children.  The cords may become wrapped around an
infant's neck, causing strangulation. Never hang toys with long
strings, cords, loops or ribbons in cribs or playpens.  Pacifiers
should never be attached to strings or ribbons around a baby's
neck.

<H3>Section 5: Super Sitter's Surprise Box </H3>



<P>     To overcome any outbursts from the children when the parents
are leaving, you may want to have your own Super Sitter's
Surprise Box. This can be anything in the way of toys or
treasures for them to play with, to stimulate curiosity and to
take away fear of being left "forever."
    </P>
<P>     The box can be of your own design.  It can be as complicated
and complex as an overnight case filled with colorful, new,
exciting and safe toys you buy (or borrow from a younger sister
or brother).  It can be as simple as a shoe box filled with toys
you have made.  It will help ease those first difficult moments
and many more besides.      </P>

<P>     Here's how you can make your Super Sitter's Surprise Box:
       </P>
<P>     A variety of colors of "sticky-back" tape and a medium sized
box with a lid or an old overnight case are all you need.  Cut
the tape into strips, squares, triangles and circles and tape
them on to the box or case. Besides being attractive and
eye-catching, the shapes can be educational.  Fill the Surprise
Box with any of the "surprises" below:  </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>    rubber animals
     	<LI>    plastic or wooden animals with smooth edges
     	<LI>    soft plastic or cloth covered books
     	<LI>    plastic or wooden toy cars or trucks with no small
          	detachable parts
     	<LI>    large rubber ball
     	<LI>    playing cards
     	<LI>    set of measuring cups
     	<LI>    different colored bandage strips to use as "puppets" on
          	your fingers, or on the baby's fingers.
</UL>
<P>     Try to put a surprise or two -- a book, coloring book, game,
puzzle or some item of amusement into your box for an older
brother or sister.
</P>
<P>     When making your Surprise Box, remember to use only safe
toys! Check to see that they don't have any of the toy dangers.
Make your Super Sitter's Surprise Box a safe surprise!   </P>

<a name="Playing"></a>
<H3>Section 6: Playing Outdoors  </H3>


<P>     Some of your daytime sitting may include playing outdoors
with the children. Outdoor play equipment -- swings, seesaws and
slides -- can be fun, but can be dangerous too.  Play safety can
be taught to even the youngest toddlers. </P>

<P>     Children often do the unexpected on playground equipment.
They are naturally and normally curious and adventuresome.
Standing in a swing is "bigger and better" than sitting in one.
Climbing to the top, sitting or swinging on it shows great
daring.  Little ones are unaware of risk ... often jumping off or
in front of swings, seesaws or gliders.  They may walk in front
or in back of a moving swing.  In an atmosphere of "the more the
merrier," they may overload any one piece of equipment and tip
the entire structure.  Hanging "rings" are particularly dangerous
to small children whose heads may be small enough to go through
the ring, turning it into a hanging "noose."</P>

<P>    All children should be supervised when playing on this kind
of equipment.  They should be told to sit in the center of a
swing. Explain the following hazards: walking in front or in back
of a swing; pushing other children off of the swing; swinging
empty seats; twisting the swing chains; and, climbing up the
front of the slide.  Roughhousing, overloading equipment and
misuse can be curbed from the start if you're there supervising
their play.   </P>

<P>     Older children can be taught certain safety rules and why
they are important.  Asking them to assist you in supervising the
younger ones will help them to understand these rules better.
Dangerous roughhousing, stunts, overloading, abuse and misuse of
equipment and showing off are unacceptable.   </P>

<a name="Pool"></a>
<H3>Section 7: Pool Safety     </H3>



<P>     Daytime sitting can also include time in or around a
swimming pool, wading pool or spa.  Children are naturally
attracted to water, therefore, a "super sitter" must take
precautions at all times to prevent accidents from happening.
Drowning is the third leading cause of accidental death
nationwide to children under five years of age. In addition, some
3,000 youngsters in the same age group are treated each year in
hospital emergency rooms as a result of near-drownings; some of
these children are hospitalized for life as a result of
near-drowning.
     </P>
<P>     Drowning is a silent killer. When a child drowns, a baby
sitter won't hear a cry or even a splash. Drownings can happen
very quickly. </P>

<P>     How do children drown? How can you prevent a tragedy from
happening?  </P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	


<LI>   Seconds count. In seconds, a child can leave the house and
     walk to the edge of the pool.  In seconds, a child can drown
     in only a few inches of water.  A child can drown in the few
     seconds taken to answer a telephone in the house.  <BR><BR>
<LI>   Eyes on the child at all times is your best bet.  There is
     no substitute for constant supervision of the child.  <BR><BR>
<LI>   Children should be supervised and accompanied at all times,
     even though the parents previously instructed the children
     not to go near the water.  <BR><BR>
<LI>   Make sure gates leading to the pool are closed and locked.
     Lock all doors leading from the house to the pool area.
     Locks should always be out of reach of children.  <BR><BR>
<LI>   Don't consider a child to be water-safe even if the
     youngster has had swimming lessons or water-familiarity
     class.<BR><BR>
<LI>   Don't assume a pool to be safe, even one with a pool cover
     or a fence.  <BR><BR>
<LI>   Don't allow children to play on the apron surrounding the
     pool.  <BR><BR>
<LI>  If the pool is above-ground, remove the ladder to prevent
     access by anyone.  <BR><BR>
<LI>   Learn how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on
     infants and young children.  Contact your local chapter of
     the American Heart Association or American Red Cross about
     registering for classes.  <BR><BR>
<LI>   If for any reason you discover the child to be missing,
     check the pool, wading pool, spa or hot tub first. <BR><BR>
<LI>   Know the telephone numbers to call for emergency medical
     service. In some locations you dial 911, in others a
     seven-digit number. As a "super sitter" you can teach the
     children that safe play can still be fun play!  <BR><BR>

<H3>Section 8: Poison: Food For Thought Only! </H3>



<P>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT...
  </P>
<P>     Not everything that goes into a child's mouth falls into the
category of food. Too often, what ends up in mouths and stomachs
may be deadly! Growing children are curious about things that
glitter and shine, pretty colored pills, bottles and containers
of all kinds, and what's in them.  Children under the age of five
are in stages of growth where they are constantly exploring and
investigating.  This is how they learn.  Unfortunately, what
children see and reach for, they put into their mouths and
swallow. </P>

<P>     Every year thousands of youngsters across the country
receive emergency hospital or doctor's care because of accidental
poisoning. These are chiefly children under five who have
ingested some common household item which suddenly becomes poison
in the wrong hands (and mouths). These include medicines,
cleaning products and preparations, insect sprays, lighter fluid
and kerosene, turpentine and paints.
   </P>
<P>     You can help prevent accidental poisonings, while baby
sitting and in your own home too.  Here are some things you
should remember:  </P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
     <LI>    All household products and medicines should be stored
out of sight and reach of young children -- preferably locked up!
(If you are sitting where household cleaning agents are stored
under the sink and you are in charge of a "crawler" -- or the
medicine cabinet is accessible to a "climber" -- you can put
protective tape across the front of the cabinet as an extra
precaution.)  <BR><BR>

     <LI>    As a baby sitter you should not be expected to
give any medication.  But in certain circumstances, you may
be asked to give a medication during the time the parents are
away.  If it is absolutely necessary that you do this, have
the parents leave explicit, written instructions for you.

 </UL>

<P>SOME GENERAL POINTS TO REMEMBER ABOUT MEDICATIONS ARE:  </P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">


     <LI>  Read the label on the container carefully as well as the
instructions from the parents.
    <LI>  Never leave the child alone with the medication.  If the
phone rings take the medication with you.
     <LI>  Return the medication to its safe storage place with the
safety closure on securely.
     <LI>  Do not call the medication candy.
     <LI>  Do not give the medication in the dark.
     <LI>  Do not take any medication yourself in the presence of
the child.
    <LI>  Be careful of what you might be bringing into the house.
</OL>

<P>Children are normally curious and can get into a pocketbook,
briefcase or overnight case of a guest which could contain
medications.  An otherwise "poison-proof" household can become
the scene of an accidental poisoning incident.  </P>

<P>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW TO DO...
     IF THERE IS A POISONING ACCIDENT:</P>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	


     <LI>  DON'T WAIT to see what effect it may have.  If you think
the child has swallowed medicine or a household product, call a
Poison Control Center, doctor, or hospital IMMEDIATELY! (These
should be emergency numbers on your list.)  Describe what was
taken and how much, giving as much information as you can.
Describe the condition of the child -- vomiting, drowsiness,
change of color, coldness of skin.  In the event no medical
instructions are available, check the label on the container
for emergency procedures and directions, if any.  DO NOT
INDUCE VOMITING UNLESS INSTRUCTED BY MEDICAL PERSONNEL OR THE
LABEL GIVES SUCH INSTRUCTIONS.  IF INSTRUCTED TO INDUCE
VOMITING, GIVE SYRUP OF IPECAC.  (NOTE: PARENTS SHOULD KEEP
ON HAND A ONE-OUNCE BOTTLE OF SYRUP OF IPECAC FOR EACH CHILD
IN THE HOME). <BR><BR>
     <LI> Call in a neighbor who can help you take care of this
emergency; get the child medical aid, or help take care of
other children in the family.  At this point, don't try to
take on all of the care and responsibility yourself. <BR><BR>
     <LI>  Call the parents.  Explain what has happened, what has
already been done and what is yet to be done.  If the child is to
be taken to a hospital or doctor's office, it may be more
expedient to get the child there and have the parents go there
immediately rather than come home first. Speed, of course, is
important. But equally important is the way you handle the
situation.  Try to keep control.  A frightened and sick child
will become more frightened if you are excited or show panic.
Accidental poisoning is a frightening experience, but if you know
preventive measures, you will be able to handle the situation
when it happens.  (Tell the parents about child resistant safety
packaging which can help prevent these kinds of accidents.)

<H3>Section 9: Time To Leave!   </H3>



<P>     Before you realize it, the parents have arrived to find you
and their children safe and sound, and to see you home safely.
During your first sitting experience, you may have been nervous,
but with each new one, you will gain confidence, especially if
you remember the Super Sitter Tips we have discussed. Here is a
summary of those tips which you should keep foremost in your mind
until you are confident that you know them:  </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>

     <LI> Know what to do in emergencies by being prepared for one,
knowing what could happen and how to react to it.  Take first
aid instructions.<BR><BR>
     <LI> Always know where the emergency exits are located. <BR><BR>
     <LI> Keep doors and windows locked for the safety of both
yourself and the children. <BR><BR>
     <LI> Know where the "danger" items are -- medicines,
bleaches, household cleaners and electrical appliances.  Keep
them out of children's reach if the parents have not locked
them away in a secure place. <BR><BR>
     <LI> In case of accident or illness, don't try to be a doctor
or nurse except for minor cuts and bruises. <BR><BR>
     <LI>Keep your emergency telephone list handy -- use these
numbers when you need them. <BR><BR>
     <LI>Depend on the parents or a neighbor in any emergency
situation that you are not sure how to handle yourself. <BR><BR>
     <LI> Prevent play accidents by keeping the
youngsters safe. <BR><BR>
<LI> Supervise where they play, what they play
with and teach them safe play. Keep these safety tips
in mind ... they will make your baby sitting experience both safe
and fun for you and the children.  They will make you a SUPER
SAFE SITTER.

 <p> WASHINGTON. May 1, 1996-- Hazards in the home account for over 26,000 deaths and approximately seven million injuries each year in the United States, according to the American Trauma Society. That's roughly one death every 20 minutes and one injury every five seconds.</p>

<p>
People feel safe in their homes. They don't realize that disabling injuries in the home are more numerous than in the workplace, or in motor-vehicle crashes. Nor do they realize how many ways injuries can occur. But a tour of the house often reveals many hazards needing correction. Here is a short list of ways to reduce the possibility of injuries around the house:</p>

 
<H4>STAIRS </H4>  
<ul><li>Avoid clutter, light area adequately, and secure any carpeting tightly.
 </ul>
 
<H4>KITCHEN </H4>

 
<ul><li>Store household cleaners where tots cannot reach. Place appropriate fire extinguisher away from stove. Obtain a sturdy step stool for climbing. Keep sharp utensils out of tots' way. When cooking, make sure pot handles are turned away from the front of the stove. </ul>


<H4>BATHROOM </H4>
<ul><li>Use non-skid rugs on floor and secure decals or non-skid mats in tub/shower. Make sure the thermostat on the hot water heater is set no higher than 120 degrees Fahrenheit to avoid scalds.</ul>



<H4>BEDROOM</H4> 

<ul><li>Keep lamp/light switch near bed and place night-light in path between bed and bathroom. </ul>

<H4>BASEMENT/GARAGE </H4>

<ul><li>Make sure garage doors, whether electrically or manually operated, are in good working condition. Store flammable materials tightly closed and away from furnace/water heater. </ul>

<H4>NURSERY </H4>

<ul><li>Buy cribs with slats 2 3/8&quot;&quot; apart or less and keep cribs/other furniture away from windows where tots could climb up and fall out. </ul>

<p>Each year, the American Trauma Society conducts a campaign on injury prevention to alert Americans to trauma -- meaning injury -- and how to combat it. This ninth campaign highlights safety in the home.</p>

<p> The American Trauma Society (ATS) founded in 1968, is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the prevention of trauma and the improvement of trauma care. As part of its efforts, the ATS develops education awareness/prevention programs which are conducted by institutions throughout the nation.</p>

<a name="Enrichment"></a>
<H3>Should The Cluster Grouping Model Replace Out-Of-Class Enrichment Programs
For Gifted Students?   </H3>


<P>No. Cluster grouping provides an effective complement to any gifted
education program. Gifted students need time to be together when they can
just "be themselves."  The resource teacher might also provide assistance
to all classroom teachers in their attempts to differentiate the
curriculum for students who need it.  As a matter of fact, this resource
person is being called a "Schoolwide Enrichment Specialist" in many
schools instead of a "Gifted Program Coordinator" in recognition of the
fact that so many students can benefit from "enriching" learning
opportunities. </P>

<HR>

<a name="Feasible"></a>
<H3>Is Clustering Feasible Only In Elementary Schools?  </H3>


<P>No.  Cluster grouping may be used at all grade levels and in all subject
areas.  Gifted students may be clustered in one section of any
heterogeneous class, especially when there are not enough students to form
an advanced section for a particular subject. Cluster grouping is also a
welcome option in rural settings, or wherever small numbers of gifted
students make appropriate accommodations difficult. Keep in mind, however,
if your school has enough gifted students for separate sections in which
curriculum is accelerated, such sections should be maintained. Many middle
schools have quietly returned to the practice of offering such sections.
Placement in cluster groups is gained by demonstrating that one needs a
differentiated curriculum--not by proving one is "gifted." </P>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>


<a name="Records"></a>
<H3>How Are Records Kept Of The Progress Made By Students In Cluster
Groups?  </H3>


<P>Differentiated Educational Plans (DEP) should be maintained for gifted
students and filed with their other ongoing records.  In some schools,
teachers develop a DEP for the cluster group, rather than for individual
students.  These plans briefly describe the modifications that are planned
for the group and should be shared with parents regularly. </P>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>


<a name="Advantages"></a>
<H3>What Are The Advantages Of Cluster Grouping? </H3>


<P>Gifted students feel more comfortable when there are other students just
like them in the class. They are more likely to choose more challenging
tasks when other students will also be eligible. Teachers no longer have
to deal with the strain of trying to meet the needs of just one precocious
student in a class.  The school is able to provide a full-time,
cost-effective program for gifted students, since their learning needs are
being met every day. </P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>


<a name="Disadvantages"></a>
<H3>What Are The Disadvantages Of Cluster Grouping?  </H3>


<P>There may be pressure from parents to have their children placed in a
cluster classroom, even if they are not in the actual cluster group.
Gifted students may move into the district during the school year and not
be able to be placed in the cluster classroom.  These situations may be
handled by:  </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> providing training for all staff in compacting and
	differentiation so parents can expect those opportunities in all
classes.<BR><BR>

<LI> requiring parents to provide written documentation of their child's need
for curriculum differentiation instead of requesting the placement by
phone.  <BR><BR>
<LI> rotating the cluster teacher assignment every 2 years among
teachers who have had appropriate training so parents understand that many
teachers are capable of teaching gifted students. <BR><BR>
<LI> rotating other students into cluster classrooms over several years.
</UL>

<P>Another disadvantage might arise if the cluster teachers are not expected
to consistently compact and differentiate the curriculum. Their supervisor
must expect them to maintain the integrity of the program, and must
provide the needed support by facilitating regular meetings of cluster
teachers, and by providing time for the enrichment specialist to assist
the cluster teachers. </P>

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<H3>Conclusion </H3>

<P>There is an alarming trend in many places to eliminate gifted education
programs in the mistaken belief that all students are best served in
heterogeneous learning environments.  Educators have been bombarded with
research that makes it appear that there is no benefit to ability grouping
for any students.  The work of Allan (1991); Feldhusen (1989); Fiedler,
Lange, &amp; Winebrenner (1993);  Kulik and Kulik (1990); Rogers (1993) and
others clearly documents the benefits of keeping gifted students together
in their areas of greatest strength for at least part of the school day.
It appears that average and below average students have much to gain from
heterogeneous grouping, but we must not sacrifice gifted students' needs
in our attempts to find the best grouping practices for all students. </P>

<P>If we do not allow cluster groups to be formed, gifted students may find
their achievement and learning motivation waning in a relatively short
period of time. Parents of gifted students may choose to enroll their
children in alternative programs, such as home schooling or charter
schools.  The practice of cluster grouping represents a mindful way to
make sure gifted students continue to receive a quality education at the
same time as schools work to improve learning opportunities for all
students. </P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>How do teachers develop an instructional plan that will be
challenging, enlightening, and intriguing to students of different
abilities, and still maintain a sense of community within the
classroom? This is the central question for educators as they begin
the quest of bringing sound instruction to gifted students in regular
classroom settings.</P>

<P>Research tells us that a large majority of gifted and talented
students spend most of their day in regular classroom settings (Cox,
Daniel, &amp; Boston, 1985). Unfortunately, instruction in the regular
classroom setting is generally not tailored to meet their unique needs
(Archambault et al., 1993; Cox, Daniel, &amp; Boston, 1985; Westberg,
Archambault, Dobyns, &amp; Salvin, 1993). This situation is putting gifted
students at risk of failing to achieve their potential. Achievement
scores below what might be expected from our brightest population
provide the evidence (Callahan, 1990; Kantrowitz &amp; Wingert, 1992; Ness
&amp; Latessa, 1979).</P>

<P>The challenge for educators is twofold. Our gifted and talented
population must have a full service education if we expect these
students to thrive in the manner in which they are capable. Second,
these students must be involved in educational experiences that are
challenging and appropriate to their needs and achievement levels. The
place to begin is in the regular classroom.</P>

<a name="Steps"></a>
<H3>What Are the Steps to Full Service?</H3>

<P>The goal for program planners dealing with the challenges of meeting
instructional needs of gifted and talented students in regular
classroom settings is to create a learning environment in which these
students can fully develop their abilities and interests without
losing their sense of membership as part of the class. This is a tall
order for teachers and students, because the usual remedy is to
segregate these students into small homogeneous groups or to assign
individual projects. While both of these strategies have their place,
neither is sufficient to accomplish the goal. Therefore, we must look
beyond the conventional, consider the overall dynamics of the
classroom, and plan for a working environment in which all the
students can fully develop their abilities and interests within the
confines of one organizational unit.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
<H3>What Are the Characteristics of Students Who Are Gifted and Talented?</H3>

<P>When asked this question, most teachers will respond by citing three
observations. First, gifted youngsters tend to get their work done
quickly and may seek further assignments or direction. Second, they
ask probing questions that tend to differ from their classmates in
depth of understanding and frequency. Finally, they have interests in
areas that are unusual or more like the interests of older students.
In fact, these observations define the characteristics that challenge
regular classroom teachers the most as they attempt to bring full
instructional service to gifted and talented students. These students
potentially differ from their classmates on three key dimensions
(Maker, 1982): (1) the pace at which they learn; (2) the depth of
their understanding; and (3) the interests that they hold. In order to
develop instructional programs that will meet the needs of gifted
students in regular classroom settings, it is necessary to address and
accommodate these defining characteristics.</P>

<hr>

<a name="Role"></a>
<H3>What Is the Role of the Regular Classroom Teacher?</H3>

<P>Most teachers have, on occasion, had students in their classes who
know more than they do about some specific topics they are teaching.
Teachers who see themselves as facilitators of learning can find a
great deal to offer these students. As a facilitator, orchestrator,
designer, or coach, the teacher presents the conditions for learning.
He or she helps the student develop the skills necessary to learn,
understand, and interpret an appropriately differentiated curriculum.
This role requires teachers to have skills in both their subject areas
(understanding its content, the manner in which its professionals
think) and in the management of learning.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Program"></a>
<H3>What Program Options Are Needed to Meet the Needs
of These Students?</H3>

<P>One of the greatest mistakes made by school districts attempting to
deliver programming to their gifted and talented students is that they
look for unidimensional approaches. The heterogeneity of the gifted
population leaves only one remedy that has any chance of succeeding
over the long haul. That is a multiple programming approach (Cox,
Daniel, &amp; Boston, 1985; Parke, 1989)--one in which a constellation of
programs is available in which students can participate based on their
abilities, needs, and interests. Some of these options may be
specifically tailored to high ability students (such as Advanced
Placement, honors, or resource room programs). Others may be found in
the course listings for general education that are available to all
students but which serve gifted and talented students well (such as
student council, school newspaper, Future Problem Solving, computer
club, etc.). Profiles of students' abilities, derived from
comprehensive assessment batteries, can be used to match students to
appropriate programs.</P>

<a name="Instructional"></a>
<H3>What Instructional Provisions Must Be Made?</H3>

<P>Designing instructional opportunities for gifted students in regular
classrooms finds its inspiration at the source of the concern--the
students. The characteristics of these students lead to the
instructional accommodations that are appropriate (The Association for
Gifted, 1989). The accelerated pace at which gifted and talented
students learn information requires that flexible pacing strategies
(Daniel &amp; Cox, 1988) such as skill grouping, curricular compacting,
contracting, and credit by examination be integrated into classroom
management formats. The need to explore topics in depth leads program
planners to include provisions such as original research, independent
studies or investigations, mentorships, or classes at another school
or institution of higher learning. When addressing the unique or
advanced interests of these students, planners might be inspired to
include opportunities such as minicourses, interest groups, clubs,
science or art fairs, or internships. The teachers' challenge is to
identify student needs, develop and gain access to appropriate
programs and curricula that correspond to those needs, and monitor
student progress throughout the course of study. The students'
challenge is to make the best possible use of the resources available
while becoming fully responsible for their own learning.</P>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>Intellectually gifted and academically talented
students are able to learn material rapidly and
understand concepts deeply. Keeping them challenged
and learning to their capacity can require changes in
their regular school programs. Education programs for
children identified as gifted and talented take many
forms pull-out programs offering educational
enrichment, honors classes, after school and summer
programs featuring special course work, and mentor
programs in which children are matched with
professionals in the community for special learning
experiences. </P>

<P>Sometimes, gifted youngsters may be so advanced in
knowledge and so clearly operating at an intellectual
level beyond that of their same-age peers that
educational acceleration is a realistic and desirable
alternative to normal grade-level work. Educational
acceleration is often perceived simply as placing a child one or
more grades ahead with older children. For instance, a
child who has completed the fourth grade may be
double-promoted to the sixth, skipping fifth grade
entirely. Sometimes, if children are especially talented
in one subject area (most often mathematics, science, or
English), they may be allowed to take advanced
courses with older students in that subject while
remaining in their own grade for other subjects. Another
alternative is to have gifted children tutored and
advanced in given subjects, either individually or in small
groups of children with similar talents. For instance, a
group of high school students might meet for advanced
mathematics classes twice a week with a professor
from a local university.</P>

<P>These arrangements are all appropriate for children
who are intellectually and academically capable of
learning at a faster pace and in greater depth than
their same-age peers, and who are motivated to do so.
Insisting that gifted and talented students remain with
their age-mates at all costs may exact too high a cost
from them. It may result in boredom and daydreaming,
poor study habits, behavior problems, or school
avoidance. But the decision to allow a child to
accelerate educationally is one that must be made for each
child, taking into account his or her intellectual and
emotional needs and the services the school can
provide.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Is"></a>
<H3>Is Educational Acceleration Harmful to the Child
Academically?</H3>

<P>The majority of studies have shown that children who
have been educationally accelerated do not suffer
academically. Their grades are higher than those of their
peers who chose not to accelerate, and they compare
favorably with those of older students in their classes.
Accelerated students also report heightened interest in
and enthusiasm for school.</P>

<H3>But Won't There Be Gaps in the Child's Knowledge?</H3>

<P>If children skip one or more grades, they may
occasionally encounter unfamiliar material from the
skipped grade. Therefore, arrangements should be
made to allow the children to cover any such material
without penalty as it is encountered. Because there is
repetition in normal curricula, gaps occur less often than
one might think and are seldom a significant problem
for the gifted and talented student, who learns quickly
and well.</P>

<H3>Is Educational Acceleration Harmful to the Child
Emotionally or Socially?</H3>

<P>This aspect of educational acceleration seems to worry
parents and educators most. In general, children who
are well-adjusted and socially at ease before
accelerating report having two groups of friends, they belong to
a circle of older students, but they also retain friend
ships with children who are the same age. </P>

<P>Children who are socially withdrawn or who have
difficulty making friends may experience similar
problems when placed with older children. On the other
hand, there are cases in which a gifted child is more
comfortable with older children than with age-mates.
This may be true more often for girls than boys. The
receiving classroom teacher in an accelerated setting
can help the younger student find a niche among the
older students.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Do Educators Think of the Educational
Acceleration Option?</H3>

<P>Research about acceleration consistently documents
positive effects, both academic and social, for children
who have accelerated, but educators have been slow to
embrace the option. Fears about social and emotional
development problems for these children are common.
However, people who specialize in working with
gifted and talented children and teachers and parents
who have had personal experience with educational
acceleration tend to be more positive.</P>

<H3>How Do Parents Know If Their Child Should
Accelerate?
</H3>
<P>If children's standardized test scores, particularly
achievement test scores, are many grades above level or
off the charts entirely, they are good candidates for
acceleration. If a child who was previously an avid
student begins to complain of boredom or starts misbehaving in school, it may be an indication that he or
she needs additional challenges (but remember that
any child may be bored or have behavior problems).
Ideally, the decision to accelerate should be mutual,
the child, parents, and school officials all agreeing
that it would serve the child well. The school
psychologist or Individualized Educational Plan (IEP)
committee should be consulted early in the process.</P>

<H3>When Should One Be Cautious About Acceleration?</H3>

<P>If the child under consideration for acceleration is
physically or emotionally immature, is pushed into the
process by adults, or receives constant negative feed
back at school from peers or educators, problems could
occur. If the school accelerates students routinely so
that an accelerated youngster does not stand out as
peculiar and has a small support group of similar
youngsters, then chances for an easy adjustment
increase. </P>

<P>A child who has been accelerated may find that he or
she is no longer the best in the class. Both parents and
the child should be ready for this. Parents should be
supportive, but never put undue pressure on the gifted
and talented child to perform, certainly not when he
or she is adjusting to a new environment. The decision to
academically accelerate a child may be reversed at
any time if it appears not to be working out for the
child academically, socially, or emotionally. Adults
should help children in this situation understand that
the change is not a failure.</P>

<a name="What About"></a>
<H3>What About Acceleration in a Single Subject?</H3>

<P>This option tends to meet with less resistance from
educators than grade-skipping because children still take
most classes with their age-mates, alleviating concerns
about social problems. Here, continuity is crucial.
Accelerating students one year, only to have them
repeat the material the next, is no solution. Teachers or
curriculum specialists can be helpful in determining
what aspects of a subject are covered in each grade.
Accelerated students may need to make special
arrangements to travel to a junior high or high school, or
even take a college course before high school
graduation. It is important to obtain the cooperation of
the school district throughout the child's educational
career. Transportation problems may prove more
difficult to solve than academic or social ones.</P>

<H3>What Are the Steps in Making the Decision To
Accelerate?
</H3>
<P>Assuming that parents and student agree to explore this
option, parents might begin by discussing it with the
school's coordinator for the gifted and talented,
guidance counselor, or principal, whichever person
knows the child best. The classroom teachers' opinions
also should be sought. Next, the child's academic
potential and social and emotional adjustment should be
evaluated by a school psychologist. The final decision
will probably be made by the school's IEP committee or
the principal. It helps to have the enthusiastic support
and understanding of the teachers who will be working
with the accelerated child, as well as commitments for
continuity and coordination from school authorities.
Parents considering this option may find it helpful to
contact the coordinator for gifted and talented
education at their state department of education.</P>

<a name="Diagnosis"></a>
<H3>III. How Is The SIDS Diagnosis Made? </H3>

<P>In doing a post-mortem examination, we don't see the lethal mechanism directly.
After death, muscles relax, so the pathologists don't find the throat muscles clamped
shut. There are little things that we find consistently, such as the pinpoint
hemorrhages I mentioned earlier, but none of those things account directly for death.
They are only clues to the way the baby died, and helpful to the pathologist in
diagnosing the case as SIDS.</P>

<P>The SIDS victim did not die of nothing. The baby died of a very distinctive entity.
Any of you who are familiar with sudden infant death will know that the typical case
falls into a narrow age range, and seemed to be okay except maybe for a cold, ate his
last meal normally, was put to bed and was later found dead. You know when you hear
that story what the pathologist is going to say. But when the story is different, then
you really want to know what the pathologist found. When there are some unusual
features to the case, the post-mortem becomes especially important, as there are
many conditions other than SIDS which can kill infants and young children suddenly.</P>

<P>If we take all babies under one year, who have (1) died unexpectedly, (2) during
sleep, with (3) no history of alarming symptoms, such as seizures, temperature over
105 degrees, and (4) no external findings to allow one to suspect a cause of death (like a
fractured skull or a skin rash), 92% of cases will be diagnosed as SIDS after autopsy.
If the infant is 2 or 3 months old, it is not possible to get an autopsy, but one can
usually do an x-ray examination to add to these four criteria. With the presence of a
normal full-body xray, the chances the death was due to SIDS goes from 92% to
98.2%.</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<hr>
<a name="Typical"></a>
<H3>IV. My Baby Wasn't A Typical SIDS Case </H3>

<P>Each of you who has personally experienced SIDS probably feels that, in some ways,
your baby doesn't fit the classical profile. You read about "high risk" babies and it's
very easy to confuse the concept of "high risk" with "typical." For example, a "high
risk" baby might be born weighing less than three pounds to a disadvantaged family
in the winter months. The risk to that baby is perhaps one in 50. The risk to a random
baby is probably in the order of one in 500. If your baby was a full-term, 8-lb. baby
who died in the summertime, and was a girl, it doesn't sound typical of the "high risk"
baby that you hear about. But, in fact, most SIDS babies are not drawn from the "high
risk" population. There are many more babies in our society who are in the "low risk"
population, and the majority of SIDS babies are from this "low risk" population.</P>

<P>Thus, the 8-lb. baby is a more "typical" SIDS victim than is a 3-lb. premie, even
though that premie had a higher individual risk of dying. Because there are so many
full-term babies, they constitute the majority of SIDS babies. The same principal
applies to the other so-called "high risk" factors. Therefore, these things you read
about "high risk" SIDS babies often lead to confusion and it is important to
understand that "high risk" and "typical" are very different concepts.</P>

<P>Any one case is a single dot on the bell-shaped curve and it could fall anywhere on
that curve. The description of a population as a whole does not describe each
individual member of that population. That's an idea that's often difficult to get
across. I don't know if the totally typical case of SIDS ever has occurred. Every baby
that ever died was an individual, and every person who has lost a baby identifies SIDS
with that particular individual-- the hair color, behavioral patterns, and the medical
history of that baby is the profile of SIDS to that parent and family.</P>

<P>It's important for families to be able to appreciate that because that baby seemed
different than the other children in that family, it doesn't mean that difference was
in any way related to the death. My experience has made it very clear that there is
no typical pattern of behavior, for example, in babies who later die of SIDS</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<hr>
<a name="Cried"></a>

<H3>V. My Baby Cried Out During The Night He Died,
And I Feel So Guilty Because I Didn't Respond </H3>

<P>This was a death caused by airway obstruction and babies can't cry when their airway
is obstructed. So, when that baby was crying, he could not have been dying. He cried,
went to sleep, and then died later. Not responding to that cry had nothing to do with
the fact that the baby died. Babies do not die from crying.</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<hr>
<a name="Sleep"></a>

<H3>VI. Since SIDS Only Occurs During Sleep, If I Had Awakened My Baby, Would He Have Died?</H3>

<P>My answer has to be, "No, he wouldn't have died then." But, how in the world could
anybody know at what moment it was going to happen? The way to prevent SIDS
would never be to let a baby sleep, and that's obviously impossible</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<hr>
<a name="Contagious"></a>

<H3>VII. Is SIDS Contagious?</H3>

<P>Again, the answer is "no." My personal experience with over 1,200 cases includes
not one example where a SIDS victim was closely in contact with another SIDS
victim (except for three cases of twin SIDS incidences). There are times in every
community when there are more SIDS than other times. When viral diseases of
certain kinds are sweeping through the community, the incidents of SIDS will
climb. But there is no "crib death virus."</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<hr>
<a name="Again"></a>

<H3>VIII. Will It Happen Again In My Family?</H3>

<P><B>SIDS IS NOT A HEREDITARY DISEASE.</B> Early literature on SIDS suggested that
subsequent siblings of SIDS babies had a modestly increased risk of SIDS. However,
subsequent experience has shown that nearly all cases of apparent familial SIDS,
when carefully studied, can be attributed to other causes. Certain genetic or
environmental factors can result in sudden death in infancy, and some such deaths
have been mistakenly attributed to SIDS in the past. Careful studies of families with
more than one case of "SIDS" usually reveals other factors.</P>

<P>Any apparent SIDS victim who has siblings or other close relatives who have died
similar deaths should be investigated with great care to exclude genetic or
environmental factors. Many of the genetic causes of sudden death will be suggested
by the wider age range, and atypical circumstances of death (such as death while
awake) of some infants or children.</P>

<P>Since SIDS is one of the most common causes of infant mortality, affecting one in
every 1,000 infants, it can rarely strike twice in the same family on random chance
alone. However, present evidence suggests that subsequent siblings of true SIDS
victims are at no higher risk of this phenomenon than any other babies. When
nonspecific risk factors such as prematurity are also present, these will raise the risk
of subsequent siblings of SIDS victims to the same degree they do for other infants. </p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<hr>
<a name="Protect"></a>

<H3>IX. What Can I Do To Protect My Next Baby From SIDS?</H3>

<P>While there is nothing now that will guarantee protection of an infant from
SIDS, a number of studies suggest that rates of SIDS may be decreased by some
simple, inexpensive and safe changes in infant rearing habits:</P>

	<ol><li> <B>Place your baby on its back or side to sleep during the SIDS age period</B>, as
now recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Populations where most
infants sleep on their backs (or sides) seem to experience significantly lower SIDS
rates that those where most infants sleep in the prone (tummy) position.
Intervention studies in several countries suggest that a change from prone sleeping
position for infants reduces SIDS rates. </p>

	<li><B> Don't expose your baby to tobacco smoke.</B> There is now substantial
evidence that SIDS rates are higher in infants whose parents or other persons in
the household smoke.</p>

	<li> <B>Don't let your baby get overheated during sleep.</B> This is perhaps the most
controversial recommendation, but several studies have suggested that infants who
cannot get rid of body heat because of excessive clothing, blankets or unusually
warm room temperature may be at higher risk of SIDS. Until this issue is settled, I
feel it is prudent to avoid excessive layers and unusually warm sleeping
environments for infants in the SIDS age range.</p>

</ol>

<P><B>NONE OF THESE SUSPECTED RISK FACTORS IS THE CAUSE OF SIDS.</B> The vast
majority of babies who sleep on their tummies, are exposed to tobacco smoke, or
have relatively warm sleeping conditions do not die in infancy, and numerous infants
with none of these risk factors have died of SIDS. These recommendations are
intended to reduce the risk for your baby, but they cannot guarantee freedom from this
tragedy.</P>

<H3>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
</H3>
<P>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant under one year of age which remains unexplained after the
performance of a complete postmortem investigation, including an autopsy, an examination of the scene of death and review of the case history. (NICHD 1990)</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="Is"></a>

<H3>What SIDS Is</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>SIDS is a definite medical entity and is the major cause of death in infants
during the first year of life.</p>

<LI>Approximately 4,000 SIDS deaths occur annually in the United States'
accounting for more than one-third of all deaths between 28 days and
one year of age.</p>

<LI>Statistically, one SIDS death occurs for every 1,000 live births.</p>

<LI>The peak incidence is between two and four months of age.</p>

<LI>SIDS occurs in all socio-economic levels.</p>

<LI>SIDS victims appear to be healthy prior to death.</p>

<LI>Though avoidance of some risk factors for SIDS may reduce the
incidence of SIDS, no risk factor has been proven to be the cause of death.
NO CASE OF SIDS COULD HAVE BEEN PREDICTED OR
PREVENTED, even by a physician.

</ul>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<hr>
<a name="Not"></a>

<H3>What SIDS Is Not</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>SIDS is not caused by external suffocation.</p>

	<LI>SIDS is not caused by the type of feeding method used.</p>

	<LI>SIDS is not cause by immunizations.</p>

	<LI>SIDS is not caused by child abuse or neglect.</p>

	<LI>SIDS is not caused by vomiting or choking.</p>

	<LI>SIDS is not contagious, nor is it infectious.</p>

	<LI>SIDS does not cause pain or suffering to the infant.

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - As Halloween approaches, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
warns parents and caregivers that as with trick-or-treaters, Halloween's hazards to children also come in disguise.</P>

<P>CPSC Chairman Ann Brown said, "This holiday is a favorite for children who love to use their imagination and
creativity. By using CPSC's safety suggestions, consumers can help ensure that their little Halloween ghosts and
goblins will have a bag of goodies to show for their fun and will not be haunted by unnecessary injuries."</P>

<P>Halloween-related injuries may involve 
<ol>
<li> eye abrasions from sharp objects attached to masks or costumes, ]
<li> skin irritations or rashes from decorative face paints or creams, and 
<li> burns from flammable costumes ignited by
open flames from items such as candles and Jack O'Lanterns. 
</ol>

<P>CPSC is releasing safety suggestions for consumers to ward off injury-demons by making this ghoulish holiday a safe and happy one.</P>


<P>Treats:Warn children not to eat any treats before an adult has examined them carefully for evidence of tampering.</P>

<P>Flame Resistant Costumes: When purchasing costumes, masks, beards, and wigs, look for the label Flame
Resistant. Although this label does not mean these items won't catch fire, it does indicate the items will resist
burning and should extinguish quickly. To minimize the risk of contact with candles and other fire sources, avoid
costumes made with flimsy materials and outfits with big, baggy sleeves or billowing skirts.</P>

<P>Costume Designs:Purchase or make costumes that are light, bright, and clearly visible to motorists. </P>

<P>For greater visibility during dusk and darkness, decorate or trim costumes with reflective tape that will glow in the beam of a car's headlights. Bags or sacks should also be light colored or decorated with reflective tape. Reflective tape is usually available in hardware, bicycle, and sporting goods stores. </P>

<P>Children should carry flashlights to see easily and be seen.</P>

<P>Costumes should be short enough so that children won't trip and fall.</P>

<P>Children should wear well-fitting, sturdy shoes. Mother's high heels are not a good idea for safe walking.</P>

<P>Tie hats and scarfs securely to prevent them from slipping over children's eyes.</P>

<P>If your child wears a mask, make sure it fits securely and has eyeholes large enough to allow full vision.</P>

<P>Swords, knives, and similar costume accessories should be made of soft, flexible material. </P>

<P>CPSC encourages parents to follow these safety tips to ensure a happy and safe Halloween. </P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury and for information on
CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To order a press
release through fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release number. Consumers can
obtain this release and recall information via Internet gopher services at <A HREF="gopher://cpsc.gov">cpsc.gov</A>
or report product hazards to <a href="mailto:info@cpsc.gov">info@cpsc.gov</a> </P>

<p>Parents are more concerned about their child's progress in reading than
in any other subject taught in school, and rightfully so.  In order for
students to achieve in math, science, English, history, geography, and other
subjects, reading skills must be developed to the point that most of them
are automatic.  Students cannot struggle with word recognition when they
should be reading quickly for comprehension of a text.</p>

<p>Because reading is so important to success in school, parents can and
should play a role in helping their children to become interested in reading
and in encouraging their growth in reading skills.  At the same time,
parents and teachers need to work together.  Many teachers are now sending
home practical ideas for parents to use with their preschoolers.  As a
result, young children are developing some of the skills at home that will later
help them in school.</p>

<h3>What Can Parents Do To Help Their Preschoolers In The Learning-To-Read
Process?</h3>

<p>Research shows that children learn about reading before they enter
school.  In fact, they learn in the best manner--through observation.  Young
children, for example, see people around them
reading newspapers, books, maps, and signs.  Parents can do a lot
to foster an understanding of print by talking with their preschoolers about
signs in their environment and by letting their
children know they enjoy reading themselves.</p>

<h3>As I Read To My Preschooler, What Should I Do Specifically?</h3>

<p>Many parents recognize the value and enjoyment of reading to their young
children, but perhaps they are not clear about the specific skills that
could be enhanced through the process.  Most important, reading should be an
enjoyable experience.  Research reveals that when young children experience
warm and close contacts with their parents when they are being read to, they
develop more positive attitudes toward reading.</p>

<p>Run your index finger under the line of print.  This procedure is simple
and helps children begin to notice words and that words have meaning.  They
also gain an awareness of the conventions of reading (e.g., one reads from
left to right and from the top of the page to the bottom; sentences are made
up of words; and some sentences extend beyond a single line of print).</p>

<p>One of the greatest advantages of reading to preschoolers (or children of
any age) is the opportunity for vocabulary development. Children learn the
meaning of words through good literature; words take on rich meaning when
used in an interesting story. </p>

<h3>What Can I Do For My School-Age Child Who Doesn't Like To Read?
</h3>
<p>In the early elementary years, from first through third grades, children
continue learning HOW to read.  It is a complex process, difficult for some
and easy for others.  Care must be taken during
these early years not to overemphasize the learning-to-read process.
Reading for pleasure and information develops reading interests and offers
children the opportunity to practice their reading skills in meaningful
ways.  Parents of elementary-age children should provide reading materials
in the home that arouse  curiosity or extend their child's natural interest
in the world around them.</p>

<p>By encouraging and modeling leisure-time reading in the home, parents
take the most important step in fostering their child's reading development.</p>

<h3>How Can Reading Research Information Be Useful To Me, As A Parent?
</h3>
<p>Current research in reading reveals three important considerations for
parents AND teachers:</p>
<UL>
<li>Children who read, and read widely, become better readers. <br><br>
    
<li>Reading and writing are complementary skills.<br><br>
    
<li>Parents are important to children both as role models and    as
supporters of their efforts.<br><br>

<h3>What Does Research Say About Ways Parents Can Help Their Children With
Reading?</h3>

<p>The following suggestions have been beneficial to many parents: </p>
<UL>
<li>Provide a good role model--read yourself and read often to
   your child.<br><br>

<li>Provide varied reading material--some for reading enjoyment       and
some with information about hobbies and interests. <br><br>

<li>Encourage activities that require reading--for example,
cooking (reading a recipe), constructing a kite (reading
directions), or identifying an interesting bird's nest or 
    a shell collected at the beach (using a reference book). <br><br>

<li>Establish a reading time, even if it is only 10 minutes a  
    day.<br><br>

<li>Write notes to your school-age child; encourage written
    responses.<br><br>

<li>Ask your child to bring a library book home to read to a
    younger sibling.<br><br>

<li>Establish one evening a week for reading (instead of
television viewing).<br><br>

<li>Encourage your child in all reading efforts.<br><br>

<P>	Rebecca, a tiny ponytailed second-grader, sits in class at a Westside gradeschool that is among the best in Los Angeles. She is contemplating her personal journal, the latest classroom rage for teaching kids to read. She toils with a pencil, filling a page with her crooked sentences, then proudly hands the work to me, a visitor. "I can't spell," Rebecca says shyly, "but I know what it means."</P>

<P>	I read the page. It begins, "I go t gum calls." This, Rebecca explains with a slight frown, means "I go to gym class." I read on, but cannot do so without Rebecca's help. I cannot determine where her sentences end, since she has not been taught punctuation. Nor can I gleen her meaning by relying upon key words, because they are incomprehensible. Seed is written "sd", for example, smile is "sinil."</P>

<P>	Although Rebecca is clearly tense and worried, the teacher cheerfully tells Rebecca she will "do just fine" in time. Indeed, Rebecca's teacher tells me later that she considers barely legible personal journals to be "very good," and red correction marks on a student's work by an authority figure to be "bad."  </P>	

<P>	At a school on the east side of Los Angeles, 7 1/2-year-old Manuel swaggers up to his teacher with a thin, simplistic storybook. Manuel reads quickly - too quickly. He turns the pages long before he is done "reading" them. It is clear that he has memorized the story. I notice a small boy near Manuel, whispering words to him. The teacher praises Manuel for trying. When the friend moves off, I ask Manuel to read the first page, beginning with the word "the." He cannot read the word "the." In fact, he cannot read at all. His teacher hopes that with enough time immersed in fun books, Manuel will finally pick up reading.</P>

<P>	While these new techniques known as "whole language" may seem bizarre, they now predominate in classrooms from Marin County to San Diego, and this hottest fad since the "open" classroom of the 1970s is now marching across the country. The techniques, now growing popular in such states as Texas, North Carolina, Washington, Florida, Maryland and Massachusetts, stem from a philosophy which says that many children are poor readers because the old skills-based approach that emphasized phonics and memorization turned reading into a hated chore, alienating kids from reading.</P>

<P>	In 1987, whole language theory began its sweep across California in the form of a nationally acclaimed reading "framework" adopted by the state Board of Public Instruction that downplays the teaching of traditional reading skills. "The core idea of whole language," says one of its most vocal proponents, Mel Grubb of the California Literature Project, "is that children no longer are forced to learn skills that are disembodied from the experience of reading a story. The enjoyment and the wonder of the story is absorbed just as the skills are absorbed."</P>

<P>	The central tenets of the philosophy hold that small children trained with such techniques will write more expressively, love reading, fully consider whole meaning over mere words, and emerge as more sophisticated readers, writers and thinkers. </P>

<P>	But whole language, which sounds so promising when described by its proponents, has proved to be a near-disaster when applied to--and by--real people. In the eight years since whole language first appeared in the state's gradeschools, California's fourth-grade reading scores have plummeted to near the bottom nationally, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress(NAEP). Indeed, California's fourth graders are now such poor readers that only the children in Louisiana and Guam--both hampered by pitifully backward education systems--get worse reading scores.</P>

<P>	Charges and countercharges are flying as opposing sides try to affix blame for the deepening reading debacle. It has become clear that many of the problems stem from a tragic misreading of California's 1987 reading framework, in which school administrators saw whole language techniques not merely as a helpful supplement to the traditional lessons needed by children in kindergarten through the third grade, but as a wholesale replacement for them. Hundreds of gradeschool principals banned spelling tests outright, saying childrens' natural urge to read and write was being stifled by pressure from teachers to be precise. At hundreds more, phonics was prohibited by principals who said it was meaningless to gradeschoolers, citing a now-infamous absurdity from a traditional reading primer: "The cat sat on a fat hat."</P>

<P>	While some teachers found ways to combine the best elements of whole language with the needed skills of the old methods, others used whole language to escape the hard and time-consuming work of instructing beginning readers in phonics, grammar, spelling and other basic reading skills. The training gradeschool teachers were given to adapt the new ideas to the classroom was heavy on philosophy and soft on how to teach little kids to actually read.</P>

<P>	The situation has deteriorated so far that former California Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig, who oversaw the creation of the reading framework, has distanced himself from it, calling the framework "fatally flawed" particularly for its failure to anticipate the whole language overreaction. Indeed, he is now at the forefront of an opposition movement that is trying to reintroduce intensive teaching of rudimentary reading skills to gradeschoolers.</P>

<P>	Says Honig today: "Things got out of hand. School administrators and principals thought they were following the framework when they latched onto whole language, and our greatest mistake was in failing to say, `Look out for the crazy stuff, look out for the overreactions and the religiously anti-skills fanatics.' We totally misjudged which voices would take charge of the schools. We never dreamed it would be driven to this bizarre edge. When I tell people that we never even say the phrase `whole language' anywhere in the document, they look at me like I'm mad."</P>

<P>	A Reading Task Force appointed by California Superintendent Delaine Eastin has urged a return to intensive, sequentially taught reading skills in early gradeschool, while retaining whole language's use of rich literature and early writing. But Eastin has been met with a palace revolt in her department and from local bureaucracies such as the Los Angeles County Office of Education in the south and Petaluma School District in the north--just two of scores of defiant local bureaucracies where whole language idealogues are firmly in control.</P>

<P>	Bitter resistance from these whole language purists has delayed Eastin's reform plan, which early reading experts widely agree must heavily re-emphasize the direct, explicit teaching of "word attack" decoding skills such as phonics, a renewed emphasis on spelling and grammar, and the teaching of "phonemic awareness"--a way to overcome learning disabilities in the 10-20% of children who cannot hear the distinct letter sounds within words. Taking a cue from the country's most successful reading efforts, the task force has urged the teaching of gradeschool reading 2-3 hours per day--an emphasis California has moved away from as it has shifted toward secondary subjects such as personal health care.</P>

<P>	Already, a letter has been sent to publishers alerting them that California will select new textbooks which must return to basic lessons. And in a slap at educators, Sacramento legislators approved an "ABCs" bill requiring that gradeschools teach phonics, signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian, and lawmakers are now pursuing a similar spelling law. Meanwhile, Honig has authored a new book, Teaching Our Children to Read, a call to reincorporate "essential beginning-to-read strategies" in preschool through third grades nationwide. </P>

<P>	State officials describe the state's emerging reading plan as a "balancing" of two failed extremes--overly repetitive, unnecessarily rigid, basic skills and whole language. Eastin says the proposals are based on "solid research and a growing consensus about how children learn to read." But critics fear that without mass training, especially for newer teachers who have little grasp of how to teach early reading skills, the plan could easily fail.</P>

<P>	Says Douglas Carnine, a University of Oregon reading scholar and one of Eastin's top consultants, "I fear that the education leaders in California still don't see the real problem that has sent California to the absolute bottom in reading. You cannot keep using an entire state as an experiment. You wouldn't administer a drug to 3 million people without testing it first, would you?"</P>

<P>	How California got itself into such a quagmire, and how the state is now struggling to pull out of it, is a cautionary study in the pitfalls of untested mass innovation.</P>

<P> <B>  	THE SEEDS OF </B>the current reading disaster were planted with the best of intentions in a quiet meeting room in Sacramento. There, in 1986, a select group of educators, invited by then-Superintendent Honig, met to brainstorm about ways to set California on a new course in reading. Early participants remember an important undercurrent: they felt their ideas could influence the entire nation.</P>

<P>	As participants recall the opening day, Honig gave a ringing speechabout creating a document that would inspire dramatic change. "I told them to dream, and to forget about old rules that weren't working," says Honig. Says professor Jesus Cortez Jr. from Cal State Chico, "somebody stood up and said that we were there to create a new generation of superior thinkers and readers and writers who would run the businesses and set the policies of the 21st Century. Creating that new generation was the dominant theme from Day One."</P>

<P>	Honig asked very few reading experts to join the lofty project, because he wanted a broad mix of teachers and scholars without a pre-set agenda. Pure thought and open exchange of ideas were the order of the day. But key participants recall that, from the start, debate in the meetings was dominated by secondary school teachers and scholars--people who knew nothing about the difficult art of teaching small children how to read. The secondary school representatives emerged as natural leaders because they, more than anyone, were driven by tremendous frustration over skyrocketing dropout rates, the hatred many teenagers expressed for reading, and the embarrassing levels of remedial reading required by California high school seniors entering college.</P>

<P>	"The people who knew how the middle and upper grades would react to reading were very, very strong," says one textbook author who attended, but asked not to be named. "They also knew that something had to be done about beginning gradeschool reading, but they weren't sure what. The only big concern was over the older grades."</P>

<P>	Mel Grubb, now director of Cal State Dominguez Hill's California Literature Project, had just completed his doctorate paper on how children respond to literature, and several participants say that he was so keen on his theories and so excited about the group's power to change things for the better that his views often predominated.</P>

<P>	"The group was charting new ground, and we wanted an inspirational document," recalls Jerry Treadway, a non-voting committee member, author for Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, and a professor at San Diego State. "I remember specific meetings at which Mel Grubb and other whole language proponents convinced everyone that there was no distinction between learning how to read as a first-grader, and the way a mature reader would handle the printed word. We decided that until we got kids to deal with language the way it is used by adults, as a whole thought, our reading programs wouldn't work."</P>

<P>	Outside the insular debates of the committee, a revolution was brewing in the classrooms that would soon work its way into their talks. Whole language gurus like Ken and Yetta Goodman, professors at the University of Arizona, were selling the romantic notion that childhood reading was a "natural" act which was being repressed by teachers hooked on low-level issues like word recognition, letters and sounds. Whole language, the Goodmans and others claimed, was a smash in New Zealand--but no rigorous evaluation of that country's gradeschool reading levels had been conducted. They instead relied heavily upon their own poorly tested ideas, as well as the beliefs of theorists such as Frank Smith, whose book, "Reading Without Nonsense", urged teachers not to "interfere" with a child's learning of reading. "There are no rules of reading," Smith wrote, insisting that small children don't need phonics skills to "identify words they have not met in print before" and that "spelling has nothing to do with reading."</P>

<P> 	Unfortunately, whole language theorists were promoting such beliefs without the benefit of controlled studies or methodologically accepted research. According to articles published in 1995 by the respected American Federation of Teachers, to date, no meaningful research has ever verified their claims. "The movement's anti-science attitude forces research findings into the backroom," the Federation's articles noted. Ominously, the Federation noted, the primary tenet of whole language philosophy, that learning to read is akin to learning to speak, "is accepted by no responsible linguist, psychologist or cognitive scientist in the research community." </P>

<P>	Nevertheless, Treadway remembers how whole language thinking overtook California's framework committee discussions. "We underwent a real interesting perceptual shift in the meetings, and what we finally stated, almost derisively, is that in the traditional reading approach, the emphasis is on mere accuracy," Treadway says. "We said, `How absurd it is to care about individual words and accuracy!' Under whole language, the rule was efficiency of the mind: Get the meaning using the least perception possible. Skip words. Absorb ideas instead. At the time, it sounded great."</P>

<P>	But tension began to arise over draft language that soft pedaled the need to teach basic reading skills. At one point, Elfrieda Hiebert, an author on reading, cautioned the group about relying on "gut feelings." The noted Harvard researcher and author Jean Chall met with Honig, spelling out her key findings about how gradeschool children actually learn to read--by the careful decoding of each and every letter, sound and word, until it can be done seamlessly and without effort. According to the textbook author who has asked not to be named, Honig told relayed to the framework committee Chall's concern that, "given the number of at-risk children in California who faced a possible lifetime as poor readers, we were playing with fire by dropping the teaching of specific reading skills. But Chall's findings were completely ignored."</P>

<P>	One day, then-state curriculum official Francine Alexander made a well-received presentation in which she urged the group to seek statewide adoption of storybooks similar to the Impressions series from Holt Canada, which were filled with literature instead of traditional reading text. The group quickly warmed to Alexander's proposal. "We all said, how could we have been such fools?" recalls Treadway. "Of course if we give children great literature, fascinating stories, and wonderful tales, it will stimulate them to read."</P>

<P>	Once the core idea of using storybooks rather than textbooks swept through, Treadway says, "phonics became a huge scapegoat. The secondary teachers were saying, `Hey, you gradeschool guys are killing these kids' interest in learning with all your obsession with phonics.' And the elementary teachers on the committee bought into that, because they really loved the literature books and were bored by the old primers. What we forgot is that a lot of California teenagers do hate high school, and they do hate reading, but it's due to a whole host of social, economic and psychological reasons. It's not solely because of the first grade."</P>

<P>	Another powerful influence came into play about the same time. According to Cal State Chico's Cortez, some Latinos, Asians and blacks on the committee began to complain that California's emphasis on basic skills had left minority children behind, because most teachers required the mastery of one skill before a child could learn the next. Students who did not master the initial skills had to keep revisiting them.</P>

<P>	"We felt that these kids, especially kids who did not speak English, never got around to the actual writing," says Cortez. "We felt we had to kind of reverse that and focus first on the meaning of a story and on a child's own writing, and worry about pronunciation and sounds and spelling later. That's where invented spelling came from. There was a lot of discussion about what we should do about all the parents who were adamant about having their children learn to spell. We decided we had to educate these parents about how children really learn, which is by miscuing and review."</P>

<P>	<B>UNFORTUNATELY,</B> important research was at that moment re-confirming that just the reverse was true about how children learn to read.</P>

<P>	Reading scholar Marilyn Adams was completing a book, "Beginning to Read", which detailed widespread findings that small children have a tough time with the "miscue and review" method, which encourages a child to guess at words from context, then learn later by revising their errors. "Science has consistently, firmly and indisputably refuted these hypotheses," Adams wrote. The new research confirmed a huge body of studies from the 1960s through 1980s, which showed that gradeschoolers must very directly and clearly be shown how to decode and sound out each letter and word on their own. Without being explicitly and systematically taught that basic ability, the studies said, all but the most exceptional children were doomed to a long struggle with the printed page. </P>

<P>	Honig says he assumed that everyone on the committee agreed with the years of weighty research, and that it "went almost without saying" that children in kindergarten through third grade needed to be taught traditional decoding skills. But ultimately, the committee ignored this vast body of research. Looking back, Honig says, "it is the curse of all progressives, who control much of what happens in the field of education, that we are anti-research and anti-science, and we never seem to grasp how irrational that attitude is. This is probably our deepest failure."</P>

<P>	Grubb, of the California Literature Project, the most aggressive of the state's whole language groups, defends the lack of interest in reading research. "I don't mean to be defensive about the framework, but it was a philosophical document," says Grubb, who still insists teachers needn't spend very much classroom time on phonics or word decoding. "We didn't even cite researchers. It was philosophizing about making sense of one's world by using literature, and it promoted the idea that skills be taught to kids in the context of exploring literature, not from separate how-to books. It never said don't use phonics. It told teachers to look at the research about phonics on their own, and apply it wisely."</P>

<P>	In the end, the committee produced a thick document that was adopted by the state Board of Education and praised nationally on talk shows. Official textbooks were selected that were mostly literature; the book chosen by most  California school districts contained no traditional reading lessons at all. Schools were expected to follow the new approach, and district "compliance officers" began appearing in local classrooms.</P>

<P>	 The late 1980s and early 1990s were a heady times for whole language. In California alone, an estimated 20,000 teachers took in-service classes or learned the new approach from mentors. Others paid $650 to private trainers like Bob and Marlene McKracken, just two of a contingent of consultants who swarmed California. Expectations grew so high that several other states copied California without awaiting the outcome. They snapped up the hot new Houghton Mifflin storybook, whose teacher's manual did not contain a single traditional lesson in how to read, and whole language swept across much of the country, popping up in Texas, Washington, Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Maryland and numerous other areas. (In Massachusetts, educators caught up in the whole language phenomenon have proposed a new reading framework that is virtually identical to California's disastrous plan, prompting 40 professors at Harvard and MIT to sign a petition uring the state to reject the proposal. Pointing to California's reading crisis, the scholars are demanding that Massachusetts not repeat such a debacle.)</P>

<P>	At California's 72 teacher colleges, meanwhile, a near-religious fervor took hold. Whole language purists like Barbara Flores at Cal State San Bernardino peddled the idea, via teacher credentialing classes, that teaching phonics and other skills directly and systematically to children was actually bad for them. According to teachers who were trained at Cal State Northridge, Cal State San Bernardino, USC and other California colleges, the reading methodology course was reduced to a "child-centered" discussion dominated by whole language ideas. By 1995, some 10,000 fresh new teachers had poured into California gradeschools, thousands of whom had no idea how to teach beginning reading. Recalls Treadway: "People like Barbara Flores said the child must learn phonics largely on his or her own. The purists became convinced that the black squiggles on a page would begin to make sense to kids while teachers taught larger ideas."</P>

(Holdaway, 1979)." This process facilitates the learning ofwords and of letter/sound patterns, as well as an understanding ofprint and how it is read in English.</p><p> "By discussing letter/sound relationships in the context ofauthentic reading selections." Teachers can facilitate such discussionwithin the shared reading experience, using big books or charts thatall the children can see. Alphabet books also invite the discussion ofletter/sound relationships.</p><p> "By engaging in a limited number of activities reinforcingletter/sound relationships, as an outgrowth of the shared readingexperience." For example, children might make charts of wordsexhibiting letter/sound patterns of particular interest to them. Aftertwo or more charts have been compiled, children could make relatedgraphs comparing appropriate data (Whitin et al, 1990).</p><p> "By learning to use letter/sound cues along with prior knowledge andcontext." For example, proficient readers seem unconsciously to useinitial letters plus prior knowledge and context to predict what aword might be, before focusing on more of the word or the followingcontext to confirm or correct. This strategy seems to come naturallyfor many children, but others may need instructional assistance infirst using the strategy consciously.</p><p> "By rereading favorite stories, songs, and poems, independently orwith a peer." This independent practice contributes greatly tosolidifying children's growing understanding of print. The rereadingis facilitated if children have individual copies of the text, and ifthey can listen to a tape recording of the text as they read. It'sespecially helpful if the tape recording is appropriately paced(Carbo, 1989).</p><p> "By observing and participating as the teacher demonstratesletter/sound relationships while writing." For example, the teachermay model his/her writing process, lead the children in guidedwriting, and/or write something from the children's dictation.</p><p> "By writing independently, constructing their own spellings as bestthey are able." Of course, primary grade children should be writing inwhatever way they can, whether it be scribble writing, random lettersand symbols, or letters that at least begin to be decipherable aswords. But when they can use letters to represent sounds, they beginto promote their own phonics development through writing (Temple etal, 1993).</p><p> "By developing their own strategies for learning letter/soundpatterns." The story of Jevon in "Jevon Doesn't Sit at the BackAnymore" (White, 1990) beautifully illustrates how children maydevelop their own strategies that teachers are not always aware of.During Jevon's second year in her kindergarten, White noticed thatJevon was learning letter/sound relationships by observing thespellings of his classmates' names, which were written on the messageboard and sign-up sheets, as well as on the papers they wrote. Whitereports that "Long before Jevon connected sounds and symbols ininventive spelling, names made their way into his writtencommunication" (1990, 18-19).</p><a name="ways"></a><H4>Ways Teachers Can Help Children Develop Phonics Knowledge</H4><ol><li> "First, have faith in children as learners." They can and usuallywill develop a grasp of letter/sound relationships with little directinstruction, just as they learned to talk without direct instructionin the rules of the English language. Also, don't assume that becausechildren cannot do worksheets on particular phonics elements that theycannot read words with those same patterns (e.g. the example fromWatson and Crowley, 1988, 263-265).</p><li> "Discuss interesting patterns of onsets and rhymes, in the contextof shared reading experiences." Among the stories, poems, rhymes, andsongs chosen to share with children should be some that emphasizealliteration and rhyme. One of the best ways to generate children'sinterest in the sound elements of a selection may be to ask simply"What do you notice about this poem?" or, more specifically, "What doyou notice about the sound in this poem?" (Mills et al, 1992). Thoughchildren may notice different sound elements than the teacheranticipated, this procedure gives children ownership over their ownlearning. Of course much of the poetry that rhymes is humorouspoetry--one thinks, for example, of Shel Silverstein's poetry or JackPrelutsky's, though humorous poetry should comprise only a modestproportion of the poetry to which children are introduced. One bookparticularly rich in poems with alliteration, rhyme, and onomatopoeiais "Noisy Poems," collected by Jill Bennett (Oxford University Press,1987). A cumulative book with wonderfully alliterative andonomatompoetic verbs is "Deep Down Underground," by Olivier Dunrea(Macmillan, 1989).</p><li> "As an outgrowth of the shared reading experience, engage childrenin, and/or allow for, a limited number of activities that reinforcetheir natural learning of letter/sound relationships and patterns."Mathematically-related ideas can involve the making of charts thatlist words with particular sound patterns, and graphs based upon thecharts (for example, you might chart all the "sl-" and "sp-" and "st-"words in several poems, then make a class graph showing the relativefrequency of the words in each list (see Whitin et al, 1990). Childrenmay especially enjoy collaborating in such activities--and in creatingtheir own alphabet books, too. In "Looking Closely: Exploring the Roleof Phonics in One Whole Language Classroom (Mills et al, 1992)," wesee various phonics-enhancing activities that can stem from andenhance enjoyment of literature, as well as activities involvingchildren's names.</p><li> "Emphasize the use of letter/sound cues along with prior knowledgeand context." Teachers can do this, such as: (1) by modeling how theythemselves use meaning (and grammar) along with initial letters topredict what a word might be; (2) by repeatedly encouraging childrento think "what would make sense here" before trying to sound out aword, (3) by engaging together in oral cloze activities based on theirshared readings ("What would fit in this sentence, 'I put c------ inthe soup?'") and (4) by discussing, in literature discussion groups,how various children dealt with problem words. It is critical to helpchildren develop and use letter/sound knowledge in the context ofconstructing meaning from texts.</p><li> "Foster the acquisition of phonics knowledge indirectly, throughvarious means--" </p><ul><li>by pointing to words during shared reading experiences with bigbooks, charts, etc. </p><li>by providing small, multiple copies of many selections, so thatchildren can easily reread favorite stories, songs, and poems </p><li>by providing tapes of many selections for children to listen to, asthey follow along with the written text </p><li>by attending to letter/sound patterns while modeling the writingprocess, engaging children in guided writing, and writing down whatchildren have dictated </p><li>by encouraging children to write as best they can, and by helpingthem to develop phonemic awareness and phonics knowledge throughinvented spelling (see Freppon &amp; Dahl, 1991) </p><li>by encouraging children to experiment with print and solidify theirunderstanding of letter/sound patterns in a variety of self-chosenways.</p></ul><li> "Be alert for children's idiosyncratic ways of developing phonicsknowledge, and support those." Jevon's learning of letter/soundrelationships through his classmates' names is but one example (White,1990).</p><li> "By providing additional materials and help for individualchildren, as appropriate." For instance, children who seem readily tograsp the concept of letter/sound relationships might especiallybenefit from Dr. Seuss books that reinforce letter/sound patterns--andother children would enjoy and benefit from such books too. Childrenwho are exceptionally slow in grasping letter/sound relationships maybenefit from tutorial assistance, such as that offered in Marie Clay'sReading Recovery Program.</p></ol><a name="References"></a><H3>References</H3> <P>Carbo, M.

<h2>Great Tips for Choosing Reading Software </h2>

<ol>
<li>Be realistic.  Computers alone won't transform your child into a successful reader. There's still nothing better than lots of real books - plus family encouragement and example - to inspire a love of reading.
<br><br>
<li>Vary your purchases - different types of software encourage and reinforce different literacy skills.  Beside phonics programs, consider interactive stories and story-writing software.
<br><br>
<li>Select interactive stories the way you choose books:  Let the appeal of the story and the artwork be your guide.
<br><br>
<li>Be choosy.  Not all interactive stories are worthwhile.  Some don't add anything special enough to justify their hefty price.  Others are so TV-like that children become passive viewers, not involved readers.  
<br><br>
<li>Find out how (and when) your child's school teaches word skills.  Talk with the teacher about your child's learning style and capabilities. 
<br><br>
<li>If your child gets a steady diet of worksheets in school, focus on interactive books or titles that inspire her to read or write without worrying about accuracy.  Try basic skills software if your child is getting phonics in dribs and drabs.   
<br><br>
<li>Don't underestimate geography, history, or mystery software for reading practice.  When kids get involved, they really push themselves to master skills - like reading - that will help them play better.
<br><br>
<li>As your child becomes a more accomplished reader, look for software that gives you the option of "turning off" the read-aloud feature so she can practice reading on her own.

<P>Assigning homework serves various educational needs. It serves as
an intellectual discipline, establishes study habits, eases time
constraints on the amount of curricular material that can be
covered in class, and supplements and reinforces work done in
school. In addition, it fosters student initiative, independence,

<H3>What Is Homework?</H3>

<P>Homework is defined as out-of-class tasks assigned to students as
an extension or elaboration of classroom work. There are three
types of homework: practice, preparation, and extension.</P>

<P>Practice assignments reinforce newly acquired skills. For example,
students who have just learned a new method of solving a
mathematical problem should be given sample problems to complete on
their own. Preparation assignments help students get ready for
activities that will occur in the classroom. Students may, for
example, be required to do background research on a topic to be
discussed later in class. Extension assignments are frequently
long-term continuing projects that parallel classwork. Students
must apply previous learning to complete these assignments, which
include science fair projects and term papers.</P>

<a name="Why"></a>
<H3>Why Is Homework Important?</H3>

<P>Research in the last decade has begun to focus on the relationship
between homework and student achievement and has greatly
strengthened the case for homework. Although there are mixed
findings about whether homework actually increases students'
academic achievement, many teachers and parents agree that homework
develops students' initiative and responsibility and fulfills the
expectations of students, parents, and the public. Studies
generally have found homework assignments to be most helpful if
they are carefully planned by the teachers and have direct meaning
to students.</P>

<a name="How"></a>
<H3>How Can Parents Get Involved?</H3>

<UL>
<LI> Share any concerns you may have regarding the amount or type of
homework assigned  with your child's teacher or principal. 

<LI> Encourage your child to take notes concerning homework
assignments in case questions arise later at home. 

<LI> Provide a suitable study area and the necessary tools (for
example, paper and  books) to complete the homework assignments. 

<LI> Limit after-school activities to allow time for both homework and
family activities. 


<LI> Monitor television viewing and establish a specific homework
time. 

<LI> Plan a homework schedule with your child. Allow for free time

when assignments are completed. 

<LI> Praise your child's efforts. If questions arise about the
assignments, and your child asks for help, ask him or her questions
or work through an example rather than simply  providing the
answer. 

<LI> Younger children need more parental assistance with homework than
older children. Go  over homework assignments with your child. Do
several problems or questions together,  then observe your child
doing the next one or two. 

<LI> If your child is in elementary school, check completed
assignments. At all levels, ask  to look at homework once it has
been marked and returned. 

<LI> Ask your child's teachers about their homework policy and
specific assignments.<BR><BR>

<H3>How Much Time Should My Child Spend on Homework?</H3>

<P>According to some researchers, two ways to increase students'
opportunities to learn are to increase the amount of time that
students have to learn and to expand the amount of content they
receive. Homework assignments may foster both these goals. Reforms
in education have called for increased homework, and as a result,
reports show that students are completing considerably more
homework than they did a decade ago.</P>

<P>According to statements by the National PTA and the National
Education Association (NEA), the following amounts of homework are
recommended:</P>

<UL>
<LI> From kindergarten to third grade, no more than 20
minutes per day.

<LI> From fourth to sixth grade, 20 to 40 minutes per day.

<LI> From seventh to twelfth grade, the recommended amount
of time varies according to the type and number of subjects a
student is taking. In general, college-bound students receive
lengthier and more involved homework than students preparing 
to enter the workforce immediately after graduation.<BR><BR>

<a name="Should"></a>
<H3>Why Should Parents Be Concerned About a School Homework Policy?</H3>

<UL>
<LI> Lack of an established homework policy may place either
insufficient or unrealistic demands on your child. Students may not
be expected to work to capacity; alternatively, they may receive
too many assignments from different teachers on the 
same evening.

<LI> Schools with homework policies tend to set guidelines
for teachers to correct, grade, and return homework systematically
to their students, thus reinforcing learning.

<LI> Schools with homework policies generally provide
specific guidelines regarding what is expected from parents.

<LI> Schools with homework policies tend to carefully design and
provide homework assignments appropriate to each grade level.
</UL>

<P>Students may not always view homework as a pleasant experience,
but if the assignment serves a good purpose and parents reinforce
the completion of the tasks, students will benefit by gaining
higher grades, better study habits, and a more positive attitude
toward school and learning. </P>

<P>Homework assignments give parents insight into the school
curriculum and offer a greater opportunity for student learning to
occur.</P>

<a name="Identified"></a>
<H3>How Is ADHD Identified and Diagnosed?</H3>

<P>Many parents see signs of an attention deficit in toddlers long before
the child enters school.  For example, as a 3-year-old, Henry's son
already displayed some signs of hyperactivity.  He seemed to lose
interest and dart off even during his favorite TV shows or while playing
games.  Once, during a game of "catch," he left the game before the ball
even reached him!</P>

<P>Like Henry's son, a child may be unable to focus long enough to play a
simple game.  Or, like Mark, the child may be tearing around out of
control.  But because children mature at different rates, and are very
different in personality, temperament, and energy level, it's useful to
get an expert's opinion of whether the behaviors are appropriate for the
child's age.  Parents can ask their pediatrician, or a child
psychologist or psychiatrist to assess whether their toddler has an
attention disorder or is just immature, has hyperactivity or is just
exuberant.</P>

<P>Seeing a child as "a chip off the old block" or "just like his dad" can
blind parents to the need for help.  Parents may find it hard to see
their child's behavior as a problem when it so closely resembles their
own.  In fact, like Henry, many parents first recognize their own
disorder only when their children are diagnosed.</P>

<P>In many cases, the teacher is the first to recognize that a child is
hyperactive or inattentive and may consult with the school psychologist.
Because teachers work with many children, they come to know how
"average" children behave in learning situations that require attention
and self control.  However, teachers sometimes fail to notice the needs
of children like Lisa who are quiet and cooperative.</P>

<H3>Types of Professionals Who Make the Diagnosis</H3>

<P>School-age and preschool children are often evaluated by a school
psychologist or a team made up of the school psychologist and other
specialists.  But if the school doesn't believe the student has a
problem, or if the family wants another opinion, a family may need to
see a specialist in private practice.  In such cases, who can the family
turn to?  What kinds of specialists do they need?</P>

<P>The family can start by talking with the child's pediatrician or their
family doctor.  Some pediatricians may do the assessment themselves, but
more often they refer the family to an appropriate specialist they know
and trust.  In addition, state and local agencies that serve families
and children, as well as some of the volunteer organizations listed in
the back of this booklet, can help identify an appropriate specialist.</P>

<P>Knowing the differences in qualifications and services can help the
family choose someone who can best meet their needs.  Besides school
psychologists, there are several types of specialists qualified to
diagnose and treat ADHD.  Child psychiatrists are doctors who specialize
in diagnosing and treating childhood mental and behavioral disorders.  A
psychiatrist can provide therapy and prescribe any needed medications.
Child psychologists are also qualified to diagnose and treat ADHD.  They
can provide therapy for the child and help the family develop ways to
deal with the disorder.  But psychologists are not medical doctors and
must rely on the child's physician to do medical exams and prescribe
medication.  Neurologists, doctors who work with disorders of the brain
and nervous system, can also diagnose ADHD and prescribe medicines.  But
unlike psychiatrists and psychologists, neurologists usually do not
provide therapy for the emotional aspects of the disorder.  Adults who
think they may have ADHD can also seek a psychologist, psychiatrist, or
neurologist.  But at present, not all specialists are skilled in
identifying or treating ADHD in adults.</P>

<P>Within each specialty, individual doctors and mental health
professionals differ in their experience with ADHD.  So in selecting a
specialist, it's important to find someone with specific training and
experience in diagnosing and treating the disorder.</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr>
<a name="Steps"></a>
<H3>Steps In Making a Diagnosis</H3>

<P>Whatever the specialist's expertise, his or her first task is to gather
information that will rule out other possible reasons for the child's
behavior.  In ruling out other causes, the specialist checks the child's
school and medical records.  The specialist tries to sense whether the
home and classroom environments are stressful or chaotic, and how the
child's parents and teachers deal with the child.  They may have a
doctor look for such problems as emotional disorders, undetectable
(petit mal) seizures, and poor vision or hearing.  Most schools
automatically screen for vision and hearing, so this information is
often already on record.  A doctor may also look for allergies or
nutrition problems like chronic "caffeine highs" that might make the
child seem overly active.</P>

<P>Next the specialist gathers information on the child's ongoing behavior
in order to compare these behaviors to the symptoms and diagnostic
criteria listed in the DSM ("Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders").  This involves talking with the child and if possible,
observing the child in class and in other settings.</P>

<P>The child's teachers, past and present, are asked to rate their
observations of the child's behavior on standardized evaluation forms to
compare the child's behaviors to those of other children the same age.
Of course, rating scales are subjective--they only capture the teacher's
personal perception of the child.  Even so, because teachers get to know
so many children, their judgment of how a child compares to others is
usually accurate.</P>

<P>The specialist interviews the child's teachers, parents, and other
people who know the child well, such as school staff and baby-sitters.
Parents are asked to describe their child's behavior in a variety of
situations.  They may also fill out a rating scale to indicate how
severe and frequent the behaviors seem to be.</P>

<P>In some cases, the child may be checked for social adjustment and mental
health.  Tests of intelligence and learning achievement may be given to
see if the child has a learning disability and whether the disabilities
are in all or only certain parts of the school curriculum.</P>

<P>In looking at the data, the specialist pays special attention to the
child's behavior during noisy or unstructured situations, like parties,
or during tasks that require sustained attention, like reading, working
math problems, or playing a board game.  Behavior during free play or
while getting individual attention is given less importance in the
evaluation.  In such situations, most children with ADHD are able to
control their behavior and perform well.</P>

<P>The specialist then pieces together a profile of the child's behavior.
Which ADHD-like behaviors listed in the DSM does the child show?  How
often?  In what situations?  How long has the child been doing them?
How old was the child when the problem started?  Are the behaviors
seriously interfering with the child's friendships, school activities,
or home life?   Does the child have any other related problems?  The
answers to these questions help identify whether the child's
hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention are significant and
long-standing.  If so, the child may be diagnosed with ADHD.</P>

<P>Adults are diagnosed for ADHD based on their performance at home and at
work.  When possible, their parents are asked to rate the person's
behavior as a child.  A spouse or roommate can help rate and evaluate
current behaviors.  But for the most part, adults are asked to describe
their own experiences.  One symptom is a sense of frustration.  Since
people with ADHD are often bright and creative, they often report
feeling frustrated that they're not living up to their potential.  Many
also feel restless and are easily bored.  Some say they need to seek
novelty and excitement to help channel the whirlwind in their minds.
Although it may be impossible to document when these behaviors first
started, most adults with ADHD can give examples of being inattentive,
impulsive, overly active, impatient, and disorganized most of their
lives.</P>

<P>Until recent years, adults were not thought to have ADHD, so many adults
with ongoing symptoms have never been diagnosed.  People like Henry go
for decades knowing that something is wrong, but not knowing what it is.
Psychotherapy and medication for anxiety, depression, or
manic-depression fail to help much, simply because the ADHD itself is
not being addressed.  Yet half the children with ADHD continue to have
symptoms through adulthood.  The recent awareness of adult ADHD means
that many people can finally be correctly diagnosed and treated.</P>

<P>A correct diagnosis lets people move forward in their lives.  Once the
disorder is known, they can begin to receive whatever combination of
educational, medical, and emotional help they need.</P>

<P>An effective treatment plan helps people with ADHD and their families at
many levels.  For adults with ADHD, the treatment plan may include
medication, along with practical and emotional support.  For children
and adolescents, it may include providing an appropriate classroom
setting, the right medication, and helping parents to manage their
child's behavior.</P>

<a name="Options"></a> 
<H3>What Are the Educational Options?</H3>

<P>Children with ADHD have a variety of needs.  Some children are too
hyperactive or inattentive to function in a regular classroom, even with
medication and a behavior management plan.  Such children may be placed
in a special education class for all or part of the day.  In some
schools, the special education teacher teams with the classroom teacher
to meet each child's unique needs.  However, most children are able to
stay in the regular classroom.  Whenever possible, educators prefer to
not to segregate children, but to let them learn along with their peers.</P>

<P>Children with ADHD often need some special accommodations to help them
learn.  For example, the teacher may seat the child in an area with few
distractions, provide an area where the child can move around and
release excess energy, or establish a clearly posted system of rules and
reward appropriate behavior.  Sometimes just keeping a card or a picture
on the desk can serve as a visual reminder to use the right school
behavior, like raising a hand instead of shouting out, or staying in a
seat instead of wandering around the room.  Giving a child like Lisa
extra time on tests can make the difference between passing and failing,
and gives her a fairer chance to show what she's learned.  Reviewing
instructions or writing assignments on the board, and even listing the
books and materials they will need for the task, may make it possible
for disorganized, inattentive children to complete the work.</P>

<P>Many of the strategies of special education are simply good teaching
methods.  Telling students in advance what they will learn, providing
visual aids, and giving written as well as oral instructions are all
ways to help students focus and remember the key parts of the lesson.</P>

<P>Students with ADHD often need to learn techniques for monitoring and
controlling their own attention and behavior.  For example, Mark's
teacher taught him several alternatives for when he loses track of what
he's supposed to do.  He can look for instructions on the blackboard,
raise his hand, wait to see if he remembers, or quietly ask another
child.  The process of finding alternatives to interrupting the teacher
has made him more self-sufficient and cooperative.  And because he now
interrupts less, he is beginning to get more praise than reprimands.</P>

<P>In Lisa's class, the teacher frequently stops to ask students to notice
whether they are paying attention to the lesson or if they are thinking
about something else.  The students record their answer on a chart.  As
students become more consciously aware of their attention, they begin to
see progress and feel good about staying better focused.  The process
helped make Lisa aware of when she was drifting off, so she could return
her attention to the lesson faster.  As a result, she became more
productive and the quality of her work improved.</P>

<P>Because schools demand that children sit still, wait for a turn, pay
attention, and stick with a task, it's no surprise that many children
with ADHD have problems in class.  Their minds are fully capable of
learning, but their hyperactivity and inattention make learning
difficult.  As a result, many students with ADHD repeat a grade or drop
out of school early.  Fortunately, with the right combination of
appropriate educational practices, medication, and counseling, these
outcomes can be avoided.</P>

<a name="Free"></a> 
<H3>Right to a Free Public Education</H3>

<P>Although parents have the option of taking their child to a private
practitioner for evaluation and educational services, most children with
ADHD qualify for free services within the public schools.  Steps are
taken to ensure that each child with ADHD receives an education that
meets his or her unique needs.  For example, the special education
teacher, working with parents, the school psychologist, school
administrators, and the classroom teacher, must assess the child's
strengths and weaknesses and design an Individualized Educational
Program (IEP).  The IEP outlines the specific skills the child needs to
develop as well as appropriate learning activities that build on the
child's strengths.  Parents play an important role in the process.  They
must be included in meetings and given an opportunity to review and
approve their child's IEP.</P>

<P>Many children with ADHD or other disabilities are able to receive such
special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA).  The Act guarantees appropriate services and a
public education to children with disabilities from ages 3 to 21.
Children who do not qualify for services under IDEA can receive help
under an earlier law, the National Rehabilitation Act, Section 504,
which defines disabilities more broadly.  Qualifying for services under
the National Rehabilitation Act is often called "504 eligibility."</P>

<P>Because ADHD is a disability that affects children's ability to learn
and interact with others, it can certainly be a disabling condition.
Under one law or another, most children can receive the services they
need.</P>

<ul>
 <li> When necessary, ask the teacher or boss to repeat instructions,
      rather than guess. <br><br>

 <li> Break large assignments or job tasks into small, simple tasks.
      Set a deadline for each task and reward yourself as you complete
      each one. <br><br>

 <li> Each day, make a list of what you need to do.  Plan the best order
      for doing each task. Then make a schedule for doing them.  Use a
      calendar or daily planner to keep yourself on track. <br><br>

 <li> Work in a quiet area.  Do one thing at a time.  Give yourself
      short breaks. <br><br>

 <li> Write things you need to remember in a notebook with dividers.
      Write different kinds of information, like assignments,
      appointments,  and phone numbers--in  different sections.  Keep
      the book with you all of the time. <br><br>

 <li> Post notes to yourself to help remind yourself of things you need
      to do.  Tape notes on the bathroom mirror, on the refrigerator, in
      your  school locker, or dashboard of your car--wherever you're
      likely to need the reminder.
 <br><br>
 <li> Store similar things together.  For example, keep all your
      Nintendo disks in one place, and tape cassettes in another.  Keep
      canceled checks in one place, and bills in another. <br><br>

 <li> Create a routine.  Get yourself ready for school or work at the
      same time, in the same way, every day. <br><br>

 <li> Exercise, eat a balanced diet, and get enough sleep.

<a name="Treatments"></a> 
<H3>What Treatments Are Available?</H3>

<P>For decades, medications have been used to treat the symptoms of ADHD.
Three medications in the class of drugs known as stimulants seem to be
the most effective in both children and adults.  These are
methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine or Dextrostat),
and pemoline (Cylert).  For many people, these medicines dramatically
reduce their hyperactivity and improve their ability to focus, work, and
learn.  The medications may also improve physical coordination, such as
handwriting and ability in sports.  Recent research by NIMH suggests
that these medicines may also help children with an accompanying conduct
disorder to control their impulsive, destructive behaviors.</P>

<P>Ritalin helped Henry focus on and complete tasks for the first time.
Dexedrine helped Mark to sit quietly, focus his attention, and
participate in class so he could learn.  He also became less impulsive
and aggressive.  Along with these changes in his behavior, Mark began to
make and keep friends.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, when people see such immediate improvement, they often
think medication is all that's needed.  But these medicines don't cure
the disorder, they only temporarily control the symptoms.  Although the
drugs help people pay better attention and complete their work, they
can't increase knowledge or improve academic skills.  The drugs alone
can't help people feel better about themselves or cope with problems.
These require other kinds of treatment and support.</P>

<P>For lasting improvement, numerous clinicians recommend that medications
should be used along with treatments that aid in these other areas.
There are no quick cures.  Many experts believe that the most
significant, long-lasting gains appear when medication is combined with
behavioral therapy, emotional counseling, and practical support.  Some
studies suggest that the combination of medicine and therapy may be more
effective than drugs alone.  NIMH is conducting a large study to check
this.</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr>
<a name="Stimulant"></a> 
<H3>Use of Stimulant Drugs</H3>

<P>Stimulant drugs, such as Ritalin, Cylert, and Dexedrine, when used with
medical supervision, are usually considered quite safe.  Although they
can be addictive to teenagers and adults if misused, these medications
are not addictive in children.  They seldom make children "high" or
jittery.  Nor do they sedate the child.  Rather, the stimulants help
children control their hyperactivity, inattention, and other behaviors.</P>

<P>Different doctors use the medications in slightly different ways.
Cylert is available in one form, which naturally lasts 5 to 10 hours.
Ritalin and Dexedrine come in short-term tablets that last about 3
hours, as well as longer-term preparations that last through the school
day.  The short-term dose is often more practical for children who need
medication only during the school day or for special situations, like
attending church or a prom, or studying for an important exam.  The
sustained-release dosage frees the child from the inconvenience or
embarrassment of going to the office or school nurse every day for a
pill.  The doctor can help decide which preparation to use,
and whether a child needs to take the medicine during school hours only
or in the evenings and on weekends, too.</P>

<P>Nine out of 10 children improve on one of the three stimulant drugs.  So
if one doesn't help, the others should be tried.  Usually a medication
should be tried for a week to see if it helps.  If necessary, however,
the doctor will also try adjusting the dosage before switching to a
different drug.</P>

<P>Other types of medication may be used if stimulants don't work or if the
ADHD occurs with another disorder.  Antidepressants and other
medications may be used to help control accompanying depression or
anxiety.  In some cases, antihistamines may be tried.  Clonidine, a drug
normally used to treat hypertension, may be helpful in people with both
ADHD and Tourette's syndrome.  Although stimulants tend to be more
effective, clonidine may be tried when stimulants don't work or can't be
used.  Clonidine can be administered either by pill or by skin patch and
has different side effects than stimulants.  The doctor works closely
with each patient to find the most appropriate medication.</P>

<P>Sometimes, a child's ADHD symptoms seem to worsen, leading parents to
wonder why.  They can be assured that a drug that helps rarely stops
working.  However, they should work with the doctor to check that the
child is getting the right dosage.  Parents should also make sure that
the child is actually getting the prescribed daily dosage at home or at
school--it's easy to forget.  They also need to know that new or
exaggerated behaviors may also crop up when a child is under stress.
The challenges that all children face, like changing schools or entering
puberty, may be even more stressful for a child with ADHD.</P>

<P>Some doctors recommend that children be taken off a medication now and
then to see if the child still needs it.  They recommend temporarily
stopping the drug during school breaks and summer vacations, when
focused attention and calm behavior are usually not as crucial.  These
"drug holidays" work well if the child can still participate at camp or
other activities without medication.</P>

<P>Children on medications should have regular checkups.  Parents should
also talk regularly with the child's teachers and doctor about how the
child is doing.  This is especially important when a medication is first
started, re-started, or when the dosage is changed.</P> 
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr>
<a name="Medication"></a>
<H3>The Medication Debate</H3>

<P>As useful as these drugs are, Ritalin and the other stimulants have
sparked a great deal of controversy.  Most doctors feel the potential
side effects should be carefully weighed against the benefits before
prescribing the drugs.  While on these medications, some children may
lose weight, have less appetite, and temporarily grow more slowly.
Others may have problems falling asleep.  Some doctors believe that
stimulants may also make the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome worse,
although recent research suggests this may not be true.  Other doctors
say if they carefully watch the child's height, weight, and overall
development, the benefits of medication far outweigh the potential side
effects.  Side effects that do occur can often be handled by reducing
the dosage.</P>

<P>It's natural for parents to be concerned about whether taking a medicine
is in their child's best interests.  Parents need to be clear about the
benefits and potential risks of using these drugs.  The child's
pediatrician or psychiatrist can provide advice and answer questions.</P>

<P>Another debate is whether Ritalin and other stimulant drugs are
prescribed unnecessarily for too many children.  Remember that many
things, including anxiety, depression, allergies, seizures, or problems
with the home or school environment can make children seem overactive,
impulsive, or inattentive.  Critics argue that many children who do not
have a true attention disorder are medicated as a way to control their
disruptive behaviors.</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr>
<a name="Esteem"></a> 
<H3>Medication and Self-Esteem</H3>

<P>When a child's schoolwork and behavior improve soon after starting
medication, the child, parents, and teachers tend to applaud the drug
for causing the sudden change.  But these changes are actually the
child's own strengths and natural abilities coming out from behind a
cloud.  Giving credit to the medication can make the child feel
incompetent.  The medication only makes these changes possible.  The
child must supply the effort and ability.  To help children feel good
about themselves, parents and teachers need to praise the child, not the
drug.</P>

<P>It's also important to help children and teenagers feel comfortable
about a medication they must take every day.  They may feel that because
they take medicine they are different from their classmates or that
there is something seriously wrong with them.  CH.A.D.D. (which stands
for Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorders), a leading
organization for people with attention disorders, suggests several ways
that parents and teachers can help children view the medication in a
positive way:</P>


<ul>
 <li> Compare the pills to eyeglasses, braces, and allergy medications
      used by other children in their class.  Explain that their
      medicine is simply a tool to help them focus and pay attention.
<br><br>
 <li> Point out that they're lucky their problem can be helped.
      Encourage them to identify ways the medicine makes it easier to do
      things that are important to them, like make friends, succeed at
      school, and play.

<H3>Treatments To Help People With ADHD and Their
Families Learn To Cope</H3>

<P>Life can be hard for children with ADHD.  They're the ones who are so
often in trouble at school, can't finish a game, and lose friends.  They
may spend agonizing hours each night struggling to keep their mind on
their homework, then forget to bring it to school.</P>

<P>It's not easy coping with these frustrations day after day.  Some
children release their frustration by acting contrary, starting fights,
or destroying property.  Some turn the frustration into body ailments,
like the child who gets a stomachache each day before school.  Others
hold their needs and fears inside, so that no one sees how badly they
feel.</P>

<P>It's also difficult having a sister, brother, or classmate who gets
angry, grabs your toys, and loses your things.  Children who live with
or share a classroom with a child who has ADHD get frustrated, too.
They may feel neglected as their parents or teachers try to cope with
the hyperactive child.  They may resent their brother or sister never
finishing chores, or being pushed around by a classmate.  They want to
love their sibling and get along with their classmate, but sometimes
it's so hard!</P>

<P>It's especially hard being the parent of a child who is full of
uncontrolled activity, leaves messes, throws tantrums, and doesn't
listen or follow instructions.  Parents often feel powerless and at a
loss.  The usual methods of discipline, like reasoning and scolding,
don't work with this child, because the child doesn't really choose to
act in these ways.  It's just that their self-control comes and goes.
Out of sheer frustration, parents sometimes find themselves spanking,
ridiculing, or screaming at the child, even though they know it's not
appropriate.  Their response leaves everyone more upset than before.
Then they blame themselves for not being better parents.  Once children
are diagnosed and receiving treatment, some of the emotional upset
within the family may fade.</P>

<P>Medication can help to control some of the behavior problems that may
have lead to family turmoil.  But more often, there are other aspects of
the problem that medication can't touch.  Even though ADHD primarily
affects a person's behavior, having the disorder has broad emotional
repercussions.  For some children, being scolded is the only attention
they ever get.  They have few experiences that build their sense of
worth and competence.  If they're hyperactive, they're often told
they're bad and punished for being disruptive.  If they are too
disorganized and unfocused to complete tasks, others may call them lazy.
If they impulsively grab toys, butt in, or shove classmates, they may
lose friends.  And if they have a related conduct disorder, they may get
in trouble at school or with the law.  Facing the daily frustrations
that can come with having ADHD can make people fear that they are
strange, abnormal, or stupid.</P>

<P>Often, the cycle of frustration, blame, and anger has gone on so long
that it will take some time to undo.  Both parents and their children
may need special help to develop techniques for managing the patterns of
behavior.  In such cases, mental health professionals can counsel the
child and the family, helping them to develop new skills, attitudes, and
ways of relating to each other.  In individual counseling, the therapist
helps children or adults with ADHD learn to feel better about
themselves.  They learn to recognize that having a disability does not
reflect who they are as a person.  The therapist can also help people
with ADHD identify and build on their strengths, cope with daily
problems, and control their attention and aggression.  In group
counseling, people learn that they are not alone in their frustration
and that others want to help.  Sometimes only the individual with ADHD
needs counseling support.  But in many cases, because the problem
affects the family as well as the person with ADHD, the entire family
may need help.  The therapist assists the family in finding better ways
to handle the disruptive behaviors and promote change.  If the child is
young, most of the therapist's work is with the parents, teaching them
techniques for coping with and improving their child's behavior.</P>

<P>Several intervention approaches are available and different therapists
tend to prefer one approach or another.  Knowing something about the
various types of interventions makes it easier for families to choose a
therapist that is right for their needs.</P>


<ul>

 <li> Psychotherapy works to help people with ADHD to like and accept
themselves despite their disorder.  In psychotherapy, patients talk with
the therapist about upsetting thoughts and feelings, explore
self-defeating patterns of behavior, and learn alternative ways to
handle their emotions.  As they talk, the therapist tries to help them
understand how they can change.  However, people dealing with ADHD
usually want to gain control of their symptomatic behaviors more
directly.  If so, more direct kinds of intervention are needed.</P>

 <li> Cognitive-behavioral therapy helps people work on immediate
issues.  Rather than helping people understand their feelings and
actions, it supports them directly in changing their behavior.  The
support might be practical assistance, like helping Henry learn to think
through tasks and organize his work.  Or the support might be to
encourage new behaviors by giving praise or rewards each time the person
acts in the desired way.  A cognitive-behavioral therapist might use
such techniques to help a belligerent child like Mark learn to control
his fighting, or an impulsive teenager like Lisa to think before she
speaks.</P>

 <li> Social skills training can also help children learn new behaviors.
In social skills training, the therapist discusses and models
appropriate behaviors like waiting for a turn, sharing toys, asking for
help, or responding to teasing, then gives children a chance to
practice.  For example, a child might learn to "read" other people's
facial expression and tone of voice, in order to respond more
appropriately.  Social skills training helped Lisa learn to join in
group activities, make appropriate comments, and ask for help.  A child
like Mark might learn to see how his behavior affects others and develop
new ways to respond when angry or pushed.</P>

 <li> Support groups connect people who have common concerns.  Many
adults with ADHD and parents of children with ADHD find it useful to
join a local or national support group.  Many groups deal with issues of
children's disorders, and even ADHD specifically.  The national
associations listed at the back of this booklet can explain how to
contact a local chapter.  Members of support groups share frustrations
and successes, referrals to qualified specialists, and information about
what works, as well as their hopes for themselves and their children.
There is strength in numbers--and sharing experiences with others who
have similar problems helps people know that they aren't alone.</P>

 <li> Parenting skills training, offered by therapists or in special
classes, gives parents tools and techniques for managing their child's
behavior.  One such technique is the use of "time out" when the child
becomes too unruly or out of control.  During time outs, the child is
removed from the agitating situation and sits alone quietly for a short
time to calm down.  Parents may also be taught to give the child
"quality time" each day, in which they share a pleasurable or relaxed
activity.  During this time together, the parent looks for opportunities
to notice and point out what the child does well, and praise his or her
strengths and abilities.</P>

</ul>

<P>An effective way to modify a child's behavior is through a system of
rewards and penalties.  The parents (or teacher) identify a few
desirable behaviors that they want to encourage in the child--such as
asking for a toy instead of grabbing it, or completing a simple task.
The child is told exactly what is expected in order to earn the reward.
The child receives the reward when he performs the desired behavior and
a mild penalty when he doesn't.  A reward can be small, perhaps a token
that can be exchanged for special privileges, but it should be something
the child wants and is eager to earn.  The penalty might be removal of a
token or a brief "time out."  The goal, over time, is to help children
learn to control their own behavior and to choose the more desired
behavior.  The technique works well with all children, although children
with ADHD may need more frequent rewards.</P>

<P>In addition, parents may learn to structure situations in ways that will
allow their child to succeed.  This may include allowing only one or two
playmates at a time, so that their child doesn't get overstimulated.  Or
if their child has trouble completing tasks, they may learn to help the
child divide a large task into small steps, then praise the child as
each step is completed.</P>

<P>Parents may also learn to use stress management methods, such as
meditation, relaxation techniques, and exercise to increase their own
tolerance for frustration, so that they can respond more calmly to their
child's behavior.</P>
<a name="Controversial"></a> 
<H3>Controversial Treatments</H3>

<P>Understandably, parents who are eager to help their children want to
explore every possible option.  Many newly touted treatments sound
reasonable.  Many even come with glowing reports.  A few are pure
quackery.  Some are even developed by reputable doctors or
specialists--but when tested scientifically, cannot be proven to help.</P>

<P>Here are a few types of treatment that have not been scientifically
shown to be effective in treating the majority of children or adults
with ADHD:</P>

<ul>
 <li> biofeedback
 <li> restricted diets
 <li> allergy treatments
 <li> medicines to correct problems in the inner ear
 <li> megavitamins
 <li> chiropractic adjustment and bone re-alignment
 <li> treatment for yeast infection
 <li> eye training
 <li> special colored glasses
</ul>

<P>A few success stories can't substitute for scientific evidence.  Until
sound, scientific testing shows a treatment to be effective, families
risk spending time, money, and hope on fads and false promises.</P>

<a name="Sustaining"></a> 
<H3>Sustaining Hope</H3>

<H4>Mark</H4>

Today, at age 14, Mark is doing much better in school.  He channels his
energy into sports and is a star player on the intramural football team.

Although he still gets into fights now and then, a child psychologist is
helping him learn to control his tantrums and frustration, and he is
able to make and keep friends.  His grandparents point to him with pride
and say, "We knew he'd turn out just fine!"

<H4>Lisa</H4>

<P>Lisa is about to graduate from high school.  She's better able to focus
her attention and concentrate on her work, so that now her grades are
quite good.  Overcoming her depression and learning to like herself have
also given her more confidence to develop friendships and try new
things.</P>

<P>Lately, she has been working with the school guidance counselor to
identify the right kind of job to look for after graduation.  She hopes
to find a career that will bypass her attention problems and make the
best use of her assets and skills.  She is more alert and focused and is
considering trying college in a year or two.  Her counselor reminds her
that she's certainly smart enough.</P>

<H4>Henry</H4>

<P>These days, Henry is successful and happy in his job as a shoe salesman.
The work allows him to move around throughout the day, and the
appearance of new customers provides the variety he needs to help him
stay focused.  He recently completed a course in time management, and
now keeps lists, organizes his work, and schedules his day.  Now that he
has harnessed his energy, his ability to think about several things at
once allows him to be creative and productive.</P>

<P>He is proud that he and his wife have developed important parenting
skills for working with their son, so that he, too, is doing better at
home and at school.  Henry is also pleased with his new ability to
follow through on projects.  In fact, he just finished making his son a
beautiful wooden toy chest for his birthday.</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr>
<a name="Outgrown"></a>
<H3>Can ADHD Be Outgrown or Cured?</H3>

<P>Even though most people don't outgrow ADHD, people do learn to adapt and
live fulfilling lives.  Mark, Lisa, and Henry are making good lives for
themselves--not by being cured, but by developing their personal
strengths.  With effective combinations of medicine, new skills, and
emotional support, people with ADHD can develop ways to control their
attention and minimize their disruptive behaviors.  Like Henry, they may
find that by structuring tasks and controlling their environment, they
can achieve personal goals.  Like Mark, they may learn to channel their
excess energy into sports and other high energy activities.  And like
Lisa, they can identify career options that build on their strengths and
abilities.</P>

<P>As they grow up, with appropriate help from parents and clinicians,
children with ADHD become better able to suppress their hyperactivity
and to channel it into more socially acceptable behaviors, like physical
exercise or fidgeting.  And although we know that half of all children
with ADHD will still show signs of the problem into adulthood, we also
know that the medications and therapy that help children also work for
adults.</P>

<P>All people with ADHD have natural talents and abilities that they can
draw on to create fine lives and careers for themselves.  In fact, many
people with ADHD even feel that their patterns of behavior give them
unique, often unrecognized, advantages.  People with ADHD tend to be
outgoing and ready for action.  Because of their drive for excitement
and stimulation, many become successful in business, sports,
construction, and public speaking.  Because of their ability to think
about many things at once, many have won acclaim as artists and
inventors.  Many choose work that gives them freedom to move around and
release excess energy.  But some find ways to be effective in quieter,
more sedentary careers.  Sally, a computer programmer, found that she
thinks best when she wears headphones to reduce distracting noises.
Like Henry, some people strive to increase their organizational skills.
Others who own their own business find it useful to hire support staff
to provide day-to-day management.</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr>
<a name="Hope"></a> 
<H3>What Hope Does Research Offer?</H3>

<P>Although no immediate cure is in sight, a new understanding of ADHD may
be just over the horizon.  Using a variety of research tools and
methods, scientists are beginning to uncover new information on the role
of the brain in ADHD and effective treatments for the disorder
Such research will ultimately result in improving the personal
fulfillment and productivity of people with ADHD.</P>

<P>For example, the use of new techniques like brain imaging to observe how
the brain actually works is already providing new insights into the
causes of ADHD.  Other research is seeking to identify conditions of
pregnancy and early childhood that may cause or contribute to these
differences in the brain.  As the body of knowledge grows, scientists
may someday learn how to prevent these differences or at least how to
treat them.</P>

<P>NIMH and the U.S. Department of Education are cosponsoring a large
national study--the first of its kind--to see which combinations of ADHD
treatment work best for different types of children.  During this 5-year
study, scientists at research clinics across the country will work
together in gathering data to answer such questions as:  Is combining
stimulant medication with behavior modification more effective than
either alone?  Do boys and girls respond differently to treatment?  How
do family stresses, income, and environment affect the severity of ADHD
and long-term outcomes?  How does needing medicine affect children's
sense of competence, self-control, and self-esteem?  As a result of such
research, doctors and mental health specialists may someday know who
benefits most from different types of treatment and be able to intervene
more effectively.</P>

<P>NIMH grantees are also trying to determine if there are different
varieties of attention deficit.  With further study, researchers may
find that ADHD actually covers a number of different disorders, each
with its own cluster of symptoms and treatment requirements.  For
example, scientists are exploring whether there are any critical
differences between children with ADHD who also have anxiety,
depression, or conduct disorders and those who do not.  Other
researchers are studying slight physical differences that might
distinguish one type of ADHD from another.  If clusters of differences
can be found, scientists can begin to distinguish the treatment each
type needs.</P>

<P>Other NIMH-sponsored research is examining the long-term outcome of
ADHD.  How do children with ADHD turn out, compared to brothers and
sisters without the disorder?  As adults, how do they handle their own
children?  Still other studies seek to better understand ADHD in adults.
Such studies give insights into what types of treatment or services make
a difference in helping an ADHD child grow into a caring parent and a
well-functioning adult.</P>

<P>Animal studies are also adding to our knowledge of ADHD in humans.
Animal subjects make it possible to study some of the possible causes of
ADHD in ways that can't be studied in people.  In addition, animal
research allows the safety and effectiveness of experimental new drugs
to be tested long before they can be given to humans.  One NIH-sponsored
team of scientists is studying dogs to learn how new stimulant drugs
that are similar to Ritalin act on the brain.</P>

<P>Piece by piece, through studies of humans and animals, scientists are
beginning to understand the biological nature of attention disorders.
New research is allowing us to better understand the inner workings of
the brain as we continue to develop new medications and assess new forms
of treatment.</P>

<P>As we learn more about what actually happens inside the brain, we
approach a future where we can prevent certain brain and mental
disorders, make valid diagnoses, and treat each effectively.  This is
the hope, mission, and vision of the National Institute of Mental
Health.</P>

<H3>What Are Sources of Information and Support?</H3>

<P>Several publications, organizations, and support groups exist to help
individuals, teachers, and families to understand and cope with
attention disorders.  The following resources provide a good starting
point for gaining insight, practical solutions, and support.  Other
resources are outpatient clinics of children's hospitals, university
medical centers, and community mental health centers.  Additional

<H3>Message From The National Institute Of Mental Health
</H3>
<P>Research conducted and supported by the National Institute of Mental
Health brings hope to millions of people who suffer from mental illness
and to their families and friends.  In many years of work with animal as
well as human subjects, researchers have advanced our understanding of
the brain and vastly expanded the capability of mental health
professionals to diagnose, treat, and prevent mental and brain
disorders.</P>

<P>Now, in the 1990s, which the President and Congress have declared the
"Decade of the Brain," we stand at the threshold of a new era in brain
and behavioral sciences.  Through research, we will learn even more
about mental and brain disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  And we will be able to use
this knowledge to develop new therapies that can help more people
overcome mental illness.</P>

<P>The National Institute of Mental Health is part of the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), the Federal Government's primary agency for
biomedical and behavioral research.  NIH is a component of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.</P>

<a name="Conditions"></a> 
<H3>Can Any Other Conditions Produce These Symptoms?</H3>

<P>The fact is, many things can produce these behaviors.  Anything from
chronic fear to mild seizures can make a child seem overactive,
quarrelsome, impulsive, or inattentive.  For example, a formerly
cooperative child who becomes overactive and easily distracted after a
parent's death is dealing with an emotional problem, not ADHD.  A
chronic middle ear infection can also make a child seem distracted and
uncooperative.  So can living with family members who are physically
abusive or addicted to drugs or alcohol.  Can you imagine a child trying
to focus on a math lesson when his or her safety and well-being are in
danger each day?  Such children are showing the effects of other
problems, not ADHD.</P>

<P>In other children, ADHD-like behaviors may be their response to a
defeating classroom situation.  Perhaps the child has a learning
disability and is not developmentally ready to learn to read and write
at the time these are taught.  Or maybe the work is too hard or too
easy, leaving the child frustrated or bored.</P>

<P>Tyrone and Mimi are two examples of how classroom conditions can elicit
behaviors that look like ADHD.  For months, Tyrone shouted answers out
in class, then became disruptive when the teacher ignored him.  He
certainly seemed hyperactive and impulsive.  Finally, after observing
Tyrone in other situations, his teacher realized he just wanted approval
for knowing the right answer.  She began to seek opportunities to call
on him and praise him.  Gradually, Tyrone became calmer and more
cooperative.</P>

<P>Mimi, a fourth grader, made loud noises during reading group that
constantly disrupted the class.  One day the teacher realized that the
book was too hard for Mimi.  Mimi's disruptions stopped when she
was placed in a reading group where the books were easier and she could
successfully participate in the lesson.</P>

<P>Like Tyrone and Mimi, some children's attention and class participation
improve when the class structure and lessons are adjusted a bit to meet
their emotional needs, instructional level, or learning style.  Although
such children need a little help to get on track at school, they
probably don't have ADHD.</P>

<P>It's also important to realize that during certain stages of
development, the majority of children that age tend to be inattentive,
hyperactive, or impulsive--but do not have ADHD.  Preschoolers have lots
of energy and run everywhere they go, but this doesn't mean they are
hyperactive.  And many teenagers go through a phase when they are messy,
disorganized, and reject authority.  It doesn't mean they will have a
lifelong problem controlling their impulses.</P>

<P>ADHD is a serious diagnosis that may require long-term treatment with
counseling and medication.  So it's important that a doctor first look
for and treat any other causes for these behaviors.</P>

<a name="Look"></a> 
<H3>What Can Look Like ADHD?</H3>

  <ul><li>  Underachievement at school due to a learning disability
  <li>  Attention lapses caused by petit mal seizures
  <li>  A middle ear infection that causes an intermittent hearing problem
  <li>  Disruptive or unresponsive behavior due to anxiety or depression
</ul>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr>
<a name="Disorders"></a>
<H3>Can Other Disorders Accompany ADHD?</H3>

<P>One of the difficulties in diagnosing ADHD is that it is often
accompanied by other problems.  For example, many children with ADHD
also have a specific learning disability (LD), which means they have
trouble mastering language or certain academic skills, typically reading
and math.  ADHD is not in itself a specific learning disability.  But
because it can interfere with concentration and attention, ADHD can make
it doubly hard for a child with LD to do well in school.</P>

<P>A very small proportion of people with ADHD have a rare disorder called
Tourette's syndrome.  People with Tourette's have tics and other
movements like eye blinks or facial twitches that they cannot control.
Others may grimace, shrug, sniff, or bark out words.  Fortunately, these
behaviors can be controlled with medication.  Researchers at NIMH and
elsewhere are involved in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of
treatment for people who have both Tourette's syndrome and ADHD.</P>

<P>More serious, nearly half of all children with ADHD--mostly boys--tend
to have another condition, called oppositional defiant disorder.  Like
Mark, who punched playmates for jostling him, these children may
overreact or lash out when they feel bad about themselves.  They may be
stubborn, have outbursts of temper, or act belligerent or defiant.
Sometimes this progresses to more serious conduct disorders.  Children
with this combination of problems are at risk of getting in trouble at
school, and even with the police.  They may take unsafe risks and break
laws--they may steal, set fires, destroy property, and drive recklessly.
It's important that children with these conditions receive help before
the behaviors lead to more serious problems.</P>

<P>At some point, many children with ADHD--mostly younger children and
boys--experience other emotional disorders.  About one-fourth feel
anxious.  They feel tremendous worry, tension, or uneasiness, even when
there's nothing to fear.  Because the feelings are scarier, stronger,
and more frequent than normal fears, they can affect the child's
thinking and behavior.  Others experience depression.  Depression goes
beyond ordinary sadness--people may feel so "down" that they feel
hopeless and unable to deal with everyday tasks.  Depression can disrupt
sleep, appetite, and the ability to think.</P>

<P>Because emotional disorders and attention disorders so often go hand in
hand, every child who has ADHD should be checked for accompanying
anxiety and depression.  Anxiety and depression can be treated, and
helping children handle such strong, painful feelings will help them
cope with and overcome the effects of ADHD.</P>

<P>(Graphic Omitted:  Diagram showing the overlapping of other disorders
with ADHD.)</P>

<P>Of course, not all children with ADHD have an additional disorder.  Nor
do all people with learning disabilities, Tourette's syndrome,
oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety, or depression
have ADHD.  But when they do occur together, the combination of problems
can seriously complicate a person's life.  For this reason, it's
important to watch for other disorders in children who have ADHD.</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr>
<a name="Causes"></a> 
<H3>What Causes ADHD?</H3>

<P>Understandably, one of the first questions parents ask when they learn
their child has an attention disorder is "Why?  What went wrong?"</P>

<P>Health professionals stress that since no one knows what causes ADHD, it
doesn't help parents to look backward to search for possible reasons.
There are too many possibilities to pin down the cause with certainty.
It is far more important for the family to move forward in finding ways
to get the right help.</P>

<P>Scientists, however, do need to study causes in an effort to identify
better ways to treat, and perhaps some day, prevent ADHD.  They are
finding more and more evidence that ADHD does not stem from home
environment, but from biological causes.  When you think about it, there
is no clear relationship between home life and ADHD.  Not all children
from unstable or dysfunctional homes have ADHD.  And not all children
with ADHD come from dysfunctional families.  Knowing this can remove a
huge burden of guilt from parents who might blame themselves for their
child's behavior.</P>

<P>Over the last decades, scientists have come up with possible theories
about what causes ADHD.  Some of these theories have led to dead ends,
some to exciting new avenues of investigation.</P>

<P>One disappointing theory was that all attention disorders and learning
disabilities were caused by minor head injuries or undetectable damage
to the brain, perhaps from early infection or complications at birth.
Based on this theory, for many years both disorders were called "minimal
brain damage" or "minimal brain dysfunction."  Although certain types of
head injury can explain some cases of attention disorder, the theory was
rejected because it could explain only a very small number of cases.
Not everyone with ADHD or LD has a history of head trauma or birth
complications.</P>

<P>Another theory was that refined sugar and food additives make children
hyperactive and inattentive.  As a result, parents were encouraged to
stop serving children foods containing artificial flavorings,
preservatives, and sugars.  However, this theory, too, came under
question.  In 1982, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Federal
agency responsible for biomedical research, held a major scientific
conference to discuss the issue.  After studying the data, the
scientists concluded that the restricted diet only seemed to help about
5 percent of children with ADHD, mostly either young children or
children with food allergies.</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr>
<a name="Usually"></a> 
<H3>ADHD Is Not Usually Caused by:</H3>

<ul>  <li>  too much TV
  <li>  food allergies
  <li>  excess sugar
  <li>  poor home life
  <li>  poor schools
  </ul>

<P>In recent years, as new tools and techniques for studying the brain have
been developed, scientists have been able to test more theories about
what causes ADHD.</P>

<P>Using one such technique, NIMH scientists demonstrated a link between a
person's ability to pay continued attention and the level of activity in
the brain.  Adult subjects were asked to learn a list of words.  As they
did, scientists used a PET (positron emission tomography) scanner to
observe the brain at work.  The researchers measured the level of
glucose used by the areas of the brain that inhibit impulses and control
attention.  Glucose is the brain's main source of energy, so measuring
how much is used is a good indicator of the brain's activity level.  The
investigators found important differences between people who have ADHD
and those who don't.  In people with ADHD, the brain areas that control
attention used less glucose, indicating that they were less active.  It
appears from this research that a lower level of activity in some parts
of the brain may cause inattention.</P>

<P>(Graphic Omitted:  Brain scan images produced by positron emission
tomography (PET) show differences between an adult with Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and an adult free of the disease.)</P>

<P>The next step will be to research WHY there is less activity in these
areas of the brain.  Scientists at NIMH hope to compare the use of
glucose and the activity level in mild and severe cases of ADHD.  They
will also try to discover why some medications used to treat ADHD work
better than others, and if the more effective medications increase
activity in certain parts of the brain.</P>

<P>Researchers are also searching for other differences between those who
have and do not have ADHD.  Research on how the brain normally develops
in the fetus offers some clues about what may disrupt the process.
Throughout pregnancy and continuing into the first year of life, the
brain is constantly developing.  It begins its growth from a few
all-purpose cells and evolves into a complex organ made of billions of
specialized, interconnected nerve cells.  By studying brain development
in animals and humans, scientists are gaining a better understanding of
how the brain works when the nerve cells are connected correctly and
incorrectly.  Scientists at NIMH and other research institutions are
tracking clues to determine what might prevent nerve cells from forming
the proper connections.  Some of the factors they are studying include
drug use during pregnancy, toxins, and genetics.</P>

<P>Research shows that a mother's use of cigarettes, alcohol, or other
drugs during pregnancy may have damaging effects on the unborn child.
These substances may be dangerous to the fetus's developing brain.  It
appears that alcohol and the nicotine in cigarettes may distort
developing nerve cells.  For example, heavy alcohol use during pregnancy
has been linked to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition that can
lead to low birth weight, intellectual impairment, and certain physical
defects.  Many children born with FAS show much the same hyperactivity,
inattention, and impulsivity as children with ADHD.</P>

<P>Drugs such as cocaine--including the smokable form known as crack--seem
to affect the normal development of brain receptors.  These brain cell
parts help to transmit incoming signals from our skin, eyes, and ears,
and help control our responses to the environment.  Current research
suggests that drug abuse may harm these receptors.  Some scientists
believe that such damage may lead to ADHD.</P>

<P>Toxins in the environment may also disrupt brain development or brain
processes, which may lead to ADHD.  Lead is one such possible toxin.  It
is found in dust, soil, and flaking paint in areas where leaded gasoline
and paint were once used.  It is also present in some water pipes.  Some
animal studies suggest that children exposed to lead may develop
symptoms associated with ADHD, but only a few cases have actually been
found.</P>

<P>Other research shows that attention disorders tend to run in families,
so there are likely to be genetic influences.  Children who have ADHD
usually have at least one close relative who also has ADHD.  And at
least one-third of all fathers who had ADHD in their youth bear children
who have ADHD.  Even more convincing:  the majority of identical twins
share the trait.  At the National Institutes of Health, researchers are
also on the trail of a gene that may be involved in transmitting ADHD in
a small number of families with a genetic thyroid disorder.</P>

<H3>Getting Help</H3>

<H4>Mark</H4>

<P>In third grade, Mark's teacher threw up her hands and said, "Enough!"
In one morning, Mark had jumped out of his seat to sharpen his pencil
six times, each time accidentally charging into other children's desks
and toppling books and papers.  He was finally sent to the principal's
office when he began kicking a desk he had overturned.  In sheer
frustration, his teacher called a meeting with his parents and the
school psychologist.</P>

<P>But even after they developed a plan for managing Mark's behavior in
class, Mark showed little improvement.  Finally, after an extensive
assessment, they found that Mark had an attention deficit that included
hyperactivity.  He was put on a medication called Ritalin to control the
hyperactivity during school hours.  Although Ritalin failed to help,
another drug called Dexedrine did.  With a psychologist's help, his
parents learned to reward desirable behaviors, and to have Mark take
"time out" when he became too disruptive.  Soon Mark was able to sit
still and focus on learning.</P>

<H4>Lisa</H4>

<P>Because Lisa wasn't disruptive in class, it took a long time for
teachers to notice her problem.  Lisa was first referred to the school
evaluation team when her teacher realized that she was a bright girl
with failing grades.  The team ruled out a learning disability but
determined that she had an attention deficit, ADHD without
hyperactivity.  The school psychologist recognized that Lisa was also
dealing with depression.</P>

<P>Lisa's teachers and the school psychologist developed a treatment plan
that included participation in a program to increase her attention span
and develop her social skills.  They also recommended that Lisa receive
counseling to help her recognize her strengths and overcome her
depression.</P>

<H4>Henry</H4>

<P>When Henry's son entered kindergarten, it was clear that he was going to
have problems sitting quietly and concentrating.  After several
disruptive incidents, the school called and suggested that his son be
evaluated for ADHD.  As the boy was assessed, Henry realized that he had
grown up with the same symptoms that specialists were now finding in his
son.  Fortunately, the psychologist knew that ADHD can persist in
adults.  She suggested that Henry be evaluated by a professional who
worked with adults.  For the first time, Henry was correctly diagnosed
and given Ritalin to aid his concentration.  What a relief!  All the
years that he had been unable to concentrate were due to a disorder that
could be identified, and above all, treated.</P>

<td valign=top>

<p>These days, community preschool programs are increasingly likely to have
at least one child with disabilities in their classes. Although providing
early intervention to children with disabilities in an inclusive or
integrated environment designed to meet the needs of ALL children is commonly
regarded as best practice (Salisbury, 1991), concerns are sometimes raised
about the ability of preschool programs to meet the needs of children
developing normally as well as those with developmental delays. This digest
examines research on preschool programs that include children both with and
without disabilities.</p>

<hr>

<a name="Children"></a>
<h3>Appropriateness For Children With Disabilities</h3>

<p>An assumption in some early childhood special education programs is that
children's disabilities prevent them from taking advantage of the experiences
that promote typical child development. Recent research suggests that this
assumption may not be valid. Lamorey and Bricker, for example, in a study of
integrated programs (Peck et al., 1993, p.249-270), found that children with
disabilities enrolled in integrated early childhood programs demonstrated
higher levels of social play and more appropriate social 
interactions, and were more likely to initiate interactions with peers than
children in self-contained special education preschool classes. Children with
disabilities in integrated classes make gains in language, cognitive, and
motor development that are comparable to peers in self-contained special
education classrooms (Fewell &amp; Oelwein, 1990).</p>

<p>Children with disabilities also display more advanced play in inclusive
settings than they do in self-contained classrooms. However, Odom and Brown,
in a discussion of social interaction skills interventions (Peck et al.,
1993, p.39-64), note that even in inclusive settings, young children with 
disabilities are more likely to engage in noninteractive play, are less
likely to participate in play groups, and are chosen as playmates less
frequently than are their peers without disabilities.</p>

<p>Some research suggests that it is the type of learning experiences that
are provided rather than the type of classroom setting (integrated or
segregated) that is critical in fostering children's development. Mahoney and
his colleagues (Mahoney &amp; Powell, 1988; Mahoney et al., 1992) found that
children with disabilities were more likely to initiate play activities and
communications with their peers in settings where the adults displayed
responsive and child-oriented teaching styles than in classes where adults
used directed and instructionally oriented styles. Results of another study
indicated that child-directed teaching strategies resulted in greater gains
in communication skills for children with severe disabilities than did direct
instruction (Yoder et al., 1991). The teaching practices described in these
studies are compatible with developmentally appropriate teaching practices
common in regular early childhood education programs.</p>

<hr>

<a name="programs"></a>
<h3>Integrated Programs And Children Without Ddisabilities</h3>

<p>The results of several studies suggest that children without disabilities
benefit from integrated classes that also address the needs of children with
disabilities. Normally developing children enrolled in integrated programs
make developmental gains at least equivalent to those made by their peers in 
nonintegrated programs (Odom &amp; McEvoy, 1988).</p>

<p>Parents and teachers believe that integrated programs offer additional
benefits for children without disabilities. Parents have reported that
normally developing children enrolled in integrated settings displayed less
prejudice and fewer stereotypes, and were more responsive and helpful to
others, than were children in other settings (Peck et al., 1992). Teachers
have reported that children without disabilities became increasingly aware of
the needs of others when they were enrolled in a class including a child with
a severe disability (Giangreco et al., 1993). While these findings are not
based on direct observations but on teachers' and parents' perceptions, they
emphasize the potential social benefits of integration for children without
disabilities.</p>

<hr>

<a name="structure"></a>
<h3>Administrative Structure Of Integrated Programs</h3>

<p>Administrative characteristics of successfully integrated programs,
according to Peck, Furman, and Helmstetter as reported in Peck et al. (1993,
p.187-205), are based on a philosophy that emphasizes the acceptance of
diversity and that places value on the program's role in and participation in
its community. The implementation of specialized interventions within
naturally occurring situations without disrupting the curriculum and
educational routines of the early childhood classroom was also an important
factor in ensuring the success of an integrated program.</p>

<p>Peck, Furman, and Helmstetter found that the progress made by individual
children in meeting developmental goals was not a critical factor in
determining whether or not a program remained integrated. Rather, the major
reasons integrated childhood programs did not survive (that is, became
resegregated) were related to the struggles between professionals over issues
such as management of time during the school day, types of classroom
activities, and intervention strategies. In other studies, teachers
emphasized the need for goals shared with special education and support
personnel (Giangreco et al., 1993; Rose &amp; Smith, 1993).</p>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="teaching"></a>
<h3>Naturalistic Teaching Strategies</h3>

<p>In addition to good administration, appropriate teaching strategies are an
important component of a successfully integrated early childhood program.
Recent research suggests that naturalistic teaching strategies provide an
approach for implementing intervention within regular classroom routines
(Bricker &amp; Cripe, 1992). In naturalistic approaches, intervention is provided
within the context of naturally occurring activities in the child's
environment. Activity-Based Intervention is one such approach. (Although not
discussed here, Milieu Language Teaching and Transactional Intervention are
other such 
approaches.) Naturalistic intervention strategies reflect practices grounded
in theories of Piaget, Vygotsky, and Dewey, and complement the
developmentally appropriate practice model used in early childhood
classrooms. Naturalistic intervention illustrates the principle of
nonintrusive individual instruction as applied in an integrated preschool
classroom. The goal of activity-based intervention is to develop functional
and generalizable skills. Functional skills are those that allow children to
negotiate through their environments in ways that are satisfying and
encourage independence, such as learning to request juice at snack time.
Generalizable skills are those  that can be practiced and used in many
different settings (Bricker &amp; Cripe, 1992).</p>

<p>In activity-based intervention strategies, teachers consider how
children's goals can be included in each classroom activity. An activity such
as snack time provides opportunities for working on eating independently (a
self-help goal), pouring juice (a fine motor goal), and requesting a food
item (a communication goal). Teachers are responsible for preparing an
environment that is stimulating for all 
children, not just those without disabilities. Regular and ongoing evaluation
of each child's progress in meeting individual goals is also a critical
component of activity-based intervention and other naturalistic
approaches.</p>

<h3>Implications Of Integrated Programs</h3>

<p>Knowledge about the ways in which integrated programs can meet the needs
of children and parents for high-quality early childhood education has grown
significantly in the past 10 years. The active involvement of parents,
regular and special education teachers, and administrators is now viewed as
crucial in developing successful integrated preschool programs. Most regular
education preschool teachers believe they are able to meet the needs of
children with disabilities in their classes when intervention is supportive
of their expertise and respects the educational approaches of the regular
classroom.</p>

<p>New teaching strategies are being developed that meet the individualized
needs of children with disabilities in inclusive classes. Researchers,
parents, and practitioners are beginning to understand that participation in
an inclusive preschool classroom influences nondisabled children's
understanding of disabilities and sensitivity to their peers. The task now
before the early childhood community is to find the 
best ways to provide education that is respectful of the talents and needs of
individual children, parents, and teachers.</p>

<p> Early intervention applies to children of school age or younger who are
discovered to have or be at risk of developing a handicapping condition or
other special need that may affect their development. Early intervention
consists in the provision of services such children and their families for
the purpose of lessening the effects of the condition. Early intervention
can be remedial or preventive in nature--remediating existing developmental
problems or preventing their occurrence. </p>

<p>Early intervention may focus on the child alone or on the child and the
family together. Early intervention programs may be center-based,
home-based, hospital-based, or a combination. Services range from
identification--that is, hospital or school screening and referral
services--to diagnostic and direct intervention programs. Early intervention
may begin at any time between birth and school age; however, there are many
reasons for it to begin as early as possible.</p>

<a name="early"></a> 
<h3>Why Intervene Early?</h3>

<p>There are three primary reasons for intervening early with an exceptional
child: to enhance the child's development, to provide support and assistance
to the family, and to maximize the child's and family's benefit to society.</p>

<p>Child development research has established that the rate of human
learning and development is most rapid in the preschool years. Timing of
intervention becomes particularly important when a child runs the risk of
missing an opportunity to learn during a state of maximum readiness. If the
most teachable moments or stages of greatest readiness are not taken
advantage of, a child may have difficulty learning a particular skill at a
later time. Karnes and Lee (1978) have noted that "only through early
identification and appropriate programming can children develop their
potential" (p. 1).</p>

<p>Early intervention services also have a significant impact on the parents
and siblings of an exceptional infant or young child. The family of a young
exceptional child often feels disappointment, social isolation, added
stress, frustration, and helplessness. The compounded stress of the presence
of an exceptional child may affect the family's well-being and interfere
with the child's development. Families of handicapped children are found to
experience increased instances of divorce and suicide, and the handicapped
child is more likely to be abused than is a nonhandicapped child. Early
intervention can result in parents having improved attitudes about
themselves and their child, improved information and skills for teaching
their child, and more
release time for leisure and employment. Parents of gifted preschoolers also
need early services so that they may better provide the supportive and
nourishing environment needed by the child.</p>

<p>A third reason for intervening early is that society will reap maximum
benefits. The child's increased developmental and educational gains and
decreased dependence upon social institutions, the family's increased
ability to cope with the presence of an exceptional child, and perhaps the
child's increased eligibility for employment, all provide economic as well
as social benefits.</p>

<a name="effective"></a>
<h3>Is Early Intervention Really Effective?</h3>

<p>After nearly 50 years of research, there is evidence--both quantitative
(data-based) and qualitative (reports of parents and
teachers)--that early intervention increases the developmental and
educational gains for the child, improves the functioning of the family, and
reaps long-term benefits for society.  Early intervention has been shown to
result in the child: (a) needing fewer special education and other
habilitative services later in life; (b) being retained in grade less often;
and (c) in some cases being indistinguishable from nonhandicapped classmates
years after intervention.</p>

<p>Disadvantaged and gifted preschool-aged children benefit from early
intervention as well. Longitudinal data on disadvantaged children who had
participated in the Ypsilanti Perry Preschool Project showed that they had
maintained significant gains at age 19 (Berrueta-Clement, Schweinhart,
Barnett, Epstein,  Weikart, 1984). These children were more committed to
schooling and more of them finished high school and went on to postsecondary
programs and employment than children who did not attend preschool. They
scored higher on reading, arithmetic, and language achievement tests at all
grade levels; showed a 50% reduction in the need for special education
services through the end of high school; and showed fewer anti-social or
delinquent behaviors outside of school. Karnes (1983) asserts that
underachievement in the gifted
child may be prevented by early identification and appropriate
programming.</p>

<a name="cost"></a>
<h3>Is Early Intervention Cost Effective?</h3>

<p>The available data emphasize the long-term cost effectiveness of early
intervention. The highly specialized, comprehensive services necessary to
produce the desired developmental gains are often, on a short-term basis,
more costly than traditional school-aged service delivery models. However,
there are significant examples of long-term cost savings that result from
such early intervention programs.</p>
<UL>
<li>A longitudinal study of children who had participated in the Perry
Preschool Project (Schweinhart and Weikart, 1980) found that when schools
invest about $3,000 for 1 year of preschool education for a child, they
immediately begin to recover their investment through savings in special
education services. Benefits included $668  from the mother's released time
while the child attended preschool; $3,353 saved by the public schools
because children with preschool education had fewer years in grades; and
$10,798 n projected lifetime earnings for the child.<br><br>

<li>Wood (1981) calculated the total cumulative costs to age 18 of special
education services to  child beginning intervention at:  (a) birth ; (b) age
2; (c) age 6; and (d) at age 6 with no eventual movement to regular
education. She found that the total costs were actually less if begun at
birth! Total cost of special services begun at birth was $37,273 and total
cost if begun at age 6 was between $46,816 and $53,340. The cost is less
when intervention is earlier because of the remediation and prevention of
developmental problems which would have required special services later in
life.<br><br>

<li>A 3-year follow-up in Tennessee showed that for every dollar spent on
early treatment, $7.00 in savings were realized within 36 months.  This
savings resulted from deferral or special class placement and
institutionalization of severe behavior disordered children (Snider,
Sullivan, and Manning, 1974).<br><br>

<li>A recent evaluation of Colorado's state-wide early intervention services
reports a cost savings of $4.00 for every dollar spent within a 3-year
period (McNulty, Smith, and Soper, 1983).<br><br>

<h3>Are There Critical Features To Include In Early Intervention?</h3>

<p>While there have been too few attempts to determine critical features of
effective early intervention programs, there are a few factors which are
present in most studies that report the greatest
effectiveness. These program features include: (a) the age of the child at
the time of intervention; (b) parent involvement ; and (c) the intensity
and/or the amount of structure of the program model.</p>
<UL>
<li>Many studies and literature reviews report that the earlier the
intervention, the more effective it is. With intervention at birth or soon
after the diagnosis of a disability or high risk factors, the developmental
gains are greater and the likelihood of developing problems is reduced
(Cooper, 1981; Garland, Stone, Swanson, and Woodruff, 1981 ; Maisto and
German, 1979; Strain, Young, and Horowitz, 1981).<br><br>

<li> The involvement of parents in their child's treatment is also important.
The data show that parents of both handicapped and gifted preschool-aged
children need the support and skills necessary to cope with their child's
special needs. Outcomes of family intervention include: (a) the parent's
ability to implement the child's program at home; and (b) reduced stress
that facilitates the health of the family. Both of these factors appear to
play an important role in the success of the program with the child
(Beckman-Bell, 1981; Cooper, 1981; Garland and others, 1981; Karnes, 1983;
Lovaas and Koegel, 1973; Shonkoff and Hauser-Cram, 1987).<br><br>

<li>Certain "structural" features are also related to the effectiveness of
early intervention, regardless of the curriculum model employed. Successful
programs are reported to be more highly structured than less successful ones
(Shonkoff and Hauser-Cram, 1987; Strain and Odom, in press). That is,
maximum benefits are reported in programs that: (a) clearly specify and
frequently monitor child and family behavior objectives; (b) precisely
identify teacher behaviors and activities that are to be used in each
lesson; (c) utilize task analysis procedures; and (d) regularly use child
assessment and progress data to modify instruction. In addition to
structure, the intensity of the services, particularly for severely
disordered children, appears to affect outcomes. Individualizing instruction
and services to meet child needs also is reported to increase effectiveness.
This does not necessarily mean one-to-one instruction. Rather, group
activities are structured to reflect the instructional needs of each
child.<br><br>

<h4>Message from the National Institute of Mental Health</h4>


<p>     Research conducted and supported by the National Institute
of Mental Health (NIMH) brings hope to millions of people who
suffer from mental illness and to their families and friends.
In many years of work with animals as well as human subjects,
researchers have advanced our understanding of the brain and
vastly expanded the capability of mental health professionals
to diagnose, treat, and prevent mental and brain disorders.<p>

<p>     Now, in the 1990s, which the President and Congress have
declared the "Decade of the Brain," we stand at the threshold
of a new era in brain and behavioral sciences. Through research
in animals and humans, we will learn even more about mental
disorders such as depression, manic-depressive illness,
schizophrenia, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive
disorder. And we will be able to use this knowledge to develop
new therapies that can help more people overcome mental
illness.<p>

 <p>    The National Institute of Mental Health is a part of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Federal Government's
primary agency for biomedical and behavioral research. NIH is a
component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<p>

 <p>    Each year millions of people in the United States develop
serious and sometimes life-threatening eating disorders. The
vast majority--more than 90 percent--of those afflicted with
eating disorders are adolescent and young adult women. One
reason that women in this age group are particularly vulnerable
to eating disorders is their tendency to go on strict diets to
achieve an "ideal" figure. Researchers have found that such
stringent dieting can play a key role in triggering eating
disorders.<p>

  <p>   Approximately 1 percent of adolescent girls develop
anorexia nervosa, a dangerous condition in which they can
literally starve themselves to death. Another 2 to 3 percent of
young women develop bulimia nervosa, a destructive pattern of
excessive overeating followed by vomiting or other "purging"
behaviors to control their weight. These eating disorders also
occur in men and older women, but much less frequently. The
consequences of eating disorders can be severe, with 1 in 10
cases leading to death from starvation, cardiac arrest, or
suicide. Fortunately, increasing awareness of the dangers of
eating disorders--sparked by medical studies and extensive
media coverage of the illness--has led many people to seek
help. Nevertheless, some people with eating disorders refuse to
admit that they have a problem and do not get treatment. Family
members and friends can help recognize the problem and
encourage the person to seek treatment.<p>

<p>     This brochure provides valuable information to individuals
suffering from eating disorders, as well as to family members
and friends trying to help someone cope with the illness. The
publication describes the symptoms of eating disorders,
possible causes, treatment options, and how to take the first
steps toward recovery.<p>

 <p>    Scientists funded by the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH) are actively studying ways to treat and
understand eating disorders. In NIMH-supported research,
scientists have found that people with eating disorders who get
early treatment have a better chance of full recovery than
those who wait years before getting help.<p>

<h3> <a name="Anorexia Nervosa">Anorexia Nervosa</a></h3>


<p>     People who intentionally starve themselves suffer from an
eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. The disorder, which
usually begins in young people around the time of puberty,
involves extreme weight loss--at least 15 percent below the
individual's normal body weight. Many people with the disorder
look emaciated but are convinced they are overweight. Sometimes
they must be hospitalized to prevent starvation.<p>

   <blockquote>
<p> Deborah developed anorexia nervosa when she was 16. A
     rather shy, studious teenager, she tried hard to please
     everyone. She had an attractive appearance, but was
     slightly overweight. Like many teenage girls, she was
     interested in boys but concerned that she wasn't pretty
     enough to get their attention. When her father jokingly
     remarked that she would never get a date if she didn't
     take off some weight, she took him seriously and began to
     diet relentlessly--never believing she was thin enough
     even when she became extremely underweight.<p>

     <p>Soon after the pounds started dropping off, Deborah's
     menstrual periods stopped. As anorexia tightened its grip,
     she became obsessed with dieting and food, and developed
     strange eating rituals. Every day she weighed all the food
     she would eat on a kitchen scale, curing solids into
     minuscule pieces and precisely measuring liquids. She
     would then put her daily ration in small containers,
     lining them up in neat rows. She also exercised
     compulsively, even after she weakened and became faint.
     She never took an elevator if she could walk up steps.<p>

     No one was able to convince Deborah that she was in
     danger. Finally, her doctor insisted that she be
     hospitalized and carefully monitored for treatment of her
     illness. While in the hospital, she secretly continued her
     exercise regimen in the bathroom, doing strenuous routines
     of situps and knee-bends. It took several hospitalizations
     and a good deal of individual and family outpatient
     therapy for Deborah to face and solve her problems.<p>
</blockquote>
   <p>   Deborah's case in not unusual. People with anorexia
typically starve themselves, even though they suffer terribly
from hunger pains. One of the most frightening aspects of the
disorder is that people with anorexia continue to think they
are overweight even when they are bone-thin. For reasons not
yet understood, they become terrified of gaining any weight.<p>

  <p>    Food and weight become obsessions. For some, the
compulsiveness shows up in strange eating rituals or the
refusal to eat in front of others. It is not uncommon for
people with anorexia to collect recipes and prepare gourmet
feasts for family and friends, but not partake in the meals
themselves. Like Deborah, they may adhere to strict exercise
routines to keep off weight. Loss of monthly menstrual periods
is typical in women with the disorder. Men with anorexia often
become impotent.<p>

<h3> <a name="Bulimia Nervosa">Bulimia Nervosa</a></h3>

 <p>     People with bulimia nervosa consume large amounts of food
and then rid their bodies of the excess calories by vomiting,
abusing laxatives or diuretics, taking enemas, or exercising
obsessively. Some use a combination of all these forms of
purging. Because many individuals with bulimia "binge and
purge" in secret and maintain normal or above normal body
weight, they can often successfully hide their problem from
others for years.<p>
<blockquote>
     <p>Lisa developed bulimia nervosa at 18. Like Deborah, her
     strange eating behavior began when she started to diet.
     She too dieted and exercised to lose weight, but unlike
     Deborah, she regularly ate huge amounts of food and
     maintained her normal weight by forcing herself to vomit.
     Lisa often felt like an emotional powder keg--angry,
     frightened, and depressed.<p>

    <p> Unable to understand her own behavior, she thought no one
     else would either. She felt isolated and lonely.
     Typically, when things were not going well, she would be
     overcome with an uncontrollable desire for sweets. She
     would eat pounds of candy and cake at a time, and often
     not stop until she was exhausted or in severe pain. Then,
     overwhelmed with guilt and disgust, she would make herself
     vomit.<p>

     <p>Her eating habits so embarrassed her that she kept them
     secret until, depressed by her mounting problems, she
     attempted suicide. Fortunately, she didn't succeed. While
     recuperating in the hospital, she was referred to an
     eating disorders clinic where she became involved in group
     therapy. There she received medications to treat the
     illness and the understanding and help she so desperately
     needed from others who had the same problem.<p>
</blockquote>
 <p>    Family, friends, and physicians may have difficulty
detecting bulimia in someone they know. Many individuals with
the disorder remain at normal body weight or above because of
their frequent binges an purges, which can range from once or
twice a week to several times a day. Dieting heavily between
episodes of binging and purging is also common. Eventually,
half of those with anorexia will develop bulimia.<p>

<p>     As with anorexia, bulimia typically begins during
adolescence. The condition occurs most often in women but is
also found in men. Many individuals with bulimia, ashamed of
their strange habits, do not seek help until they reach their
thirties or forties. By this time, their eating behavior is
deeply ingrained and more difficult to change.<p>

<h3> <a name="Binge Eating Disorder">Binge Eating Disorder</a></h3>


<p>     An illness that resembles bulimia nervosa is binge eating
disorder. Like bulimia, the disorder is characterized by
episodes of uncontrolled eating or binging. However, binge
eating disorder differs from bulimia because its sufferers do
not purge their bodies of excess food.<p>

 <p>    Individuals with binge eating disorder feel that they lose
control of themselves when eating. They eat large quantities of
food and do not stop until they are uncomfortably full.
Usually, they have more difficulty losing weight and keeping it
off than do people with other serious weight problems. Most
people with the disorder are obese and have a history of
weight fluctuations. Binge eating disorder is found in about 2
percent of the general population--more often in women than
men. Recent research shows that binge eating disorder occurs in
about 30 percent of people participating in medically
supervised weight control programs.<p>

<HR>
<h3> <a name="Medical Complications">Medical Complications</a></h3>

 <p>    Eating disorders have among the highest mortality rates of
all mental disorders, killing up to 10 percent of their
victims. Individuals with eating disorders who use drugs to
stimulate vomiting, bowel movement, or urination are in the
most danger, as this practice increases the risk of heart
failure.<p>

 <p>    In patients with anorexia, starvation can damage vital
organs such as the heart and brain. To protect itself, the body
shifts into "slow gear": monthly menstrual periods stop,
breathing, pulse, and blood pressure rates drop, and thyroid
function slows. Nails and hair become brittle; the skin dries,
yellows, and becomes covered with soft hair called lanugo.
Excessive thirst and frequent urination may occur. Dehydration
contributes to constipation, and reduced body fat leads to
lowered body temperature and the inability to withstand cold.<p>

  <p>   Mild anemia, swollen joints, reduced muscle mass, and
light-headedness also commonly occur in anorexia. If the
disorder becomes severe, patients may lose calcium from their
bones, making them brittle and prone to breakage. They may also
experience irregular heart rhythms and heart failure. In some
patients, the brain shrinks, causing personality changes.
Fortunately, this condition can be reversed when normal weight
is reestablished.<p>

<p>     In NIMH-supported research, scientists have found that
many patients with anorexia also suffer from other psychiatric
illnesses. While the majority have co-occurring clinical
depression, others suffer from anxiety, personality or
substance abuse disorders, and many are at risk for suicide.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), an illness characterized
by repetitive thoughts and behaviors, can also accompany
anorexia. Individuals with anorexia are typically compliant in
personality but may have sudden outbursts of hostility and
anger or become socially withdrawn.<p>

  <p>   Bulimia nervosa patients--even those of normal weight--can
severely damage their bodies by frequent binge eating and
purging. In rare instances, binge eating causes the stomach to
rupture; purging may result in heart failure due to loss of
vital minerals, such as potassium. Vomiting causes other less
deadly, but serious problems--the acid in vomit wears down the
outer layer of the teeth and can cause scarring on the backs of
the hands when fingers are pushed down the throat to induce
vomiting. Further, the esophagus becomes inflamed and the
glands near the cheeks become swollen. As in anorexia, bulimia
may lead to irregular menstrual periods. Interest in sex may
also diminish.<p>

 <p>    Some individuals with bulimia struggle with addictions,
including abuse of drugs and alcohol, and compulsive stealing.
Like individuals with anorexia, many people with bulimia suffer
from clinical depression, anxiety, OCD, and other psychiatric
illnesses. These problems, combined with their impulsive
tendencies place them at increased risk for suicidal behavior.<p>

 <p>    People with binge eating disorder are usually overweight,
so they are prone to the serious medical problems associated
with obesity, such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and
diabetes. Obese individuals also have a higher risk for
gallbladder disease, heart disease, and some types of cancer.
Research at NIMH and elsewhere has shown that individuals with
binge eating disorder have high rates of co-occurring
psychiatric illnesses--especially depression.<p>

<h3> <a name="Causes of Eating Disorders">Causes of Eating Disorders</a></h3>


 <p>    In trying to understand the causes of eating disorders,
scientists have studied the personalities, genetics,
environments, and biochemistry of people with these illnesses.
As is often the case, the more that is learned, the more
complex the roots of eating disorders appear.<p>
<a href="#contents">Back to contents</a><BR><BR>
<HR>
<h4> <a name="Personalities">Personalities</a></h4>

<p>     Most people with eating disorders share certain
personality traits: low self-esteem, feelings of helplessness,
and a fear of becoming fat. In anorexia, bulimia, and binge
eating disorder, eating behaviors seem to develop as a way of
handling stress and anxieties.<p>

  <p>   People with anorexia tend to be "too good to be true."
They rarely disobey, keep their feelings to themselves, and
tend to be perfectionists, good students, and excellent
athletes. Some researchers believe that people with anorexia
restrict food--particularly carbohydrates--to gain a sense of
control in some area of their lives. Having followed the wishes
of others for the most part they have not learned how to cope
with the problems typical of adolescence, growing up, and
becoming independent. Controlling their weight appears to offer
two advantages, at least initially: they can take control of
their bodies and gain approval from others. However, it
eventually becomes clear to others that they are out-of-control
and dangerously thin.<p>

  <p>   People who develop bulimia and binge eating disorder
typically consume huge amounts of food--often junk food--to
reduce stress and relieve anxiety. With binge eating, however,
comes guilt and depression. Purging can bring relief, but it is
only temporary. Individuals with bulimia are also impulsive and
more likely to engage in risky behavior such as abuse of
alcohol and drugs.<p>
<a href="#contents">Back to contents</a><BR><BR>
<HR>
<h4> <a name="Genetic and Environmental Factors">Genetic and Environmental
Factors</a></h4>


 <p>    Eating disorders appear to run in families--with female
relatives most often affected. This finding suggests that
genetic factors may predispose some people to eating disorders,
however, other influences--both behavioral and
environmental--may also play a role. One recent study found
that mothers who are overly concerned about their daughters'
weight and physical attractiveness may put the girls at
increased risk of developing an eating disorder. In addition,
girls with eating disorders often have fathers and brothers who
are overly critical of their weight.<p>

 <p>    Although most victims of anorexia and bulimia are
adolescent and young adult women, these illnesses can also
strike men and older women. Anorexia and bulimia are found most
often in Caucasians, but these illnesses also affect African
Americans and other racial ethnic groups. People pursuing
professions or activities that emphasize thinness--like
modeling, dancing, gymnastics, wrestling, and long-distance
running--are more susceptible to the problem. In contrast to
other eating disorders, one-third to one-fourth of all patients
with binge eating disorder are men. Preliminary studies also
show that the condition occurs equally among African Americans
and Caucasians.<p>

<a href="#contents">Back to contents</a><BR><BR>
<HR>
<h4> <a name="Biochemistry">Biochemistry</a></h4>

 <p>    In an attempt to understand eating disorders, scientists
have studied the biochemical functions of people with the
illnesses. They have focused recently on the neuroendocrine
system--a combination of the central nervous and hormonal
systems. Through complex but carefully balanced feedback
mechanisms, the neuroendocrine system regulates sexual
function, physical growth and development, appetite and
digestion, sleep, heart and kidney function, emotions,
thinking, and memory--in other words, multiple functions of the
mind and body. Many of these regulatory mechanisms are
seriously disturbed in people with eating disorders.<p>

 <p>    In the central nervous system--particularly the brain--key
chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters control hormone
production. Scientists have found that the neurotransmitters
serotonin and norepinephrine function abnormally in people
affected by depression. Recently, researchers funded by NIMH
have learned that these neurotransmitters are also decreased in
acutely ill anorexia and bulimia patients and long-term
recovered anorexia patients. Because many people with eating
disorders also appear to suffer from depression, some
scientists believe that there may be a link between these two
disorders. This link is supported by studies showing that
antidepressants can be used successfully to treat some people
with eating disorders. In fact, new research has suggested that
some patients with anorexia may respond well to the
antidepressant medication fluoxetine, which affects serotonin
function in the body.<p>

 <p>    People with either anorexia or certain forms of depression
also tend to have higher than normal levels of cortisol a brain
hormone released in response to stress. Scientists have been
able to show that the excess levels of cortisol in both
anorexia and depression are caused by a problem that occurs in
or near a region of the brain called the hypothalamus.<p>

 <p>    In addition to connections between depression and eating
disorders, scientists have found biochemical similarities
between people with eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD). Just as serotonin levels are known to be
abnormal in people with depression and eating disorders, they
are also abnormal in patients with OCD. Recently, NIMH
researchers have found that many patients with bulimia have
obsessive-compulsive behavior as severe as that seen in
patients actually diagnosed with OCD. Conversely, patients with
OCD frequently have abnormal eating behaviors.<p>

 <p>   The hormone vasopressin is another brain chemical found to
be abnormal in people with eating disorders and OCD. NIMH
researchers have shown that levels of this hormone are elevated
in patients with OCD, anorexia, and bulimia. Normally released
in response to physical and possibly emotional stress,
vasopressin may contribute to the obsessive behavior seen in
some patients with eating disorders.<p>

 <p>    NIMH-supported investigators are also exploring the role
of other brain chemicals in eating behavior. Many are
conducting studies in animals to shed some light on human
disorders. For example, scientists have found that levels of
neuropeptide Y and peptide YY recently shown to be elevated in
patients with anorexia and bulimia, stimulate eating behavior
in laboratory animals. Other investigators have found that
cholecystokinin (CCK), a hormone known to be low in some women
with bulimia, causes laboratory animals to feel full and stop
eating. This finding may possibly explain why women with
bulimia do not feel satisfied after eating and continue to
binge.<p>
<a href="#contents">Back to contents</a><BR><BR>
<HR>
<h3> <a name="Treatment">Treatment</a></h3>

 <p>    Eating disorders are most successfully treated when
diagnosed early.  Unfortunately, even when family members
confront the ill person about his  or her behavior, or
physicians make a diagnosis, individuals with eating disorders
may deny that they have a problem. Thus, people with anorexia may
not receive medical or psychological attention until they have
already become dangerously thin and malnourished. People with
bulimia are often normal weight and are able to hide their illness
from others for years. Eating disorders in males may be overlooked
because anorexia and bulimia are relatively rare in boys and men.
Consequently, getting--and keeping--people with these disorders into
treatment can be extremely difficult.<p>

 <p>    In any case, it cannot be overemphasized how important
treatment is--the sooner, the better. The longer abnormal
eating behaviors persist, the more difficult it is to overcome
the disorder and its effects on the body. In some cases,
long-term treatment may be requested. Families and friends
offering support and encouragement can play an important role
in the success of the treatment program.<p>

  <p>  If an eating disorder is suspected, particularly if it
involves weight loss, the first step is a complete physical
examination to rule out any other illnesses. Once an eating
disorder is diagnosed, the clinician must determine whether the
patient is in immediate medical danger and requires
hospitalization. While most patients can be treated as
outpatients, some need hospital care. Conditions warranting
hospitalization include excessive and rapid weight loss,
serious metabolic disturbances, clinical depression or risk of
suicide, severe binge eating and purging, or psychosis.<p>

   <p>  The complex interaction of emotional and physiological
problems in eating disorders calls for a comprehensive
treatment plan, involving a variety of experts and approaches.
Ideally, the treatment team includes an internist, a
nutritionist, an individual psychotherapist, a group and family
psychotherapist, and a psychopharmacologist--someone who is
knowledgeable about psychoactive medications useful in treating
these disorders.<p>

<p>     To help those with eating disorders deal with their
illness and underlying emotional issues, some form of
psychotherapy is usually needed. A psychiatrist, psychologist,
or other mental health professional meets with the patient
individually and provides ongoing emotional support, while the
patient begins to understand and cope with the illness. Group
therapy, in which people share their experiences with others
who have similar problems, has been especially effective for
individuals with bulimia.<p>

 <p>    Use of individual psychotherapy, family therapy, and
cognitive-behavioral therapy--a form of psychotherapy that
teaches patients how to change abnormal thoughts and
behavior--is often the most productive. Cognitive-behavior
therapists focus on changing eating behaviors, usually by
rewarding or modeling wanted behavior. These therapists also
help patients work to change the distorted and rigid thinking
patterns associated with eating disorders.<p>

<p>     NIMH-supported scientists have examined the effectiveness
of combining psychotherapy and medications. In a recent study
of bulimia, researchers found that both intensive group therapy
and antidepressant medications, combined or alone, benefitted
patients. In another study of bulimia, the combined use of
cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressant medications was
most beneficial. The combination treatment was particularly
effective in preventing relapse once medications were
discontinued. For patients with binge eating disorder,
cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressant medications may
also prove to be useful.<p>

 <p>    Antidepressant medications commonly used to treat bulimia
include desipramine, imipramine, and fluoxetine. For anorexia,
preliminary evidence shows that some antidepressant medications
may be effective when combined with other forms of treatment.
Fluoxetine has also been useful in treating some patients with
binge eating disorder. These antidepressants may also treat any
co-occurring depression.<p>

  <p>   The efforts of mental health professionals need to be
combined with those of other health professionals to obtain the
best treatment. Physicians treat any medical complications, and
nutritionists advise on diet and eating regimens. The challenge
of treating eating disorders is made more difficult by the
metabolic changes associated with them. Just to maintain a
stable weight, individuals with anorexia may actually have to
consume more calories than someone of similar weight and age
without an eating disorder.<p>

  <p>   This information is important for patients and the
clinicians who treat them. Consuming calories is exactly what
the person with anorexia wishes to avoid, yet must do to regain
the weight necessary for recovery. In contrast, some normal
weight people with bulimia may gain excess weight if they
consume the number of calories required to maintain normal
weight in others of similar size and age.<p>

<HR>
<h3> <a name="Helping the Person">Helping the Person With an Eating
Disorder</a></h3>

 <p>    Treatment can save the life of someone with an eating
disorder. Friends, relatives, teachers, and physicians all play
an important role in helping the ill person start and stay with
a treatment program. Encouragement, caring, and persistence, as
well as information about eating disorders and their dangers,
may be needed to convince the ill person to get help, stick
with treatment, or try again.<p>

 <p>    Family members and friends can call local hospitals or
university medical centers to find out about eating disorder
clinics and clinicians experienced in treating these illnesses.
For college students, treatment programs may be available in
school counseling centers.<p>

 <p>    Family members and friends should read as much as possible
about eating disorders, so they can help the person with the
illness understand his or her problem. Many local mental health
organizations and the self-help groups listed at the end of
this brochure provide free literature on eating disorders. Some
of these groups also provide treatment program referrals and
information on local self-help groups. Once the person gets
help, he or she will continue to need lots of understanding and
encouragement to stay in treatment.<p>

   <p>  NIMH continues its search for new and better treatments
for eating disorders. Congress has designated the 1990s as the
Decade of the Brain, making the prevention, diagnosis, and
treatment of all brain and mental disorders a national research
priority. This research promises to yield even more hope for
patients and their families by providing a greater
understanding of the causes and complexities of eating
disorders.<p>

<h3><a name="Foreword"> Foreword </a></h3>


<P>This book provides examples of a few simple activities we can do with
our children.  It is an introduction to  the wealth of material in many
other books available in libraries and bookstores.  It might also
inspire us to make up our own experiments to see why and how things
turn out the way they do.</P>

<P>Science is not something mysterious.  Being "scientific" involves
being curious, observing, asking how things  happen, and learning how
to find the answers.  Curiosity is natural to children, but they need
help understanding how to make sense of what they see. </P>

<P>Parents help their children learn--by reading to and with them, by
helping them learn to count and calculate, by helping them begin to
write, and in many other ways.</P>

<P>Most parents, though, say they do not--or cannot--help their children
with science.  But we don't need degrees in chemistry or physics to
help our children.  All we need is a willingness to observe and learn
with them, and, above all, to make an effort and take the time to
nurture their natural curiosity.</P>

<P>Achieving a higher degree of skill in science and math is one of the
national education goals.  AMERICA 2000, the long-term national
education strategy designed to  accomplish these goals, and which was
announced by President Bush on April 18 of this year, points out how
important our role as parents is:</P>
<blockquote>
     Most of all, it will take America's parents--in  their schools,
     their communities, their homes--as helpers, as examples, as
     leaders, as demanding shareholders of our schools to make the
     AMERICA 2000 education strategy work--to make this land all it
     should be.
</blockquote>
<P>AMERICA 2000 reminds us that "For schools to succeed, we must look
beyond their classrooms to our communities and families."</P>

<P>We can use this book to have fun with our children while they learn.
Whether we're baking a cake, filling the bathtub, or walking through
the park, we can invite our children into the wonders of science.
Often when we least expect it, a moment for learning will occur: a
dollop of ice cream drops on the sidewalk and ants appear.</P>

<P>Our national education goals made becoming literate in science
important for all Americans.  The President and the Governors have set
these challenging goals, and it is up to all of us to do our best to
help our children learn what they will need to know in order to live
and work in today's world and in the next century.  As always, starting
early is important--and perhaps never more so than with science.  </P>

<P>As U.S. Education Secretary Lamar Alexander has said, "There are new
World Class Standards in math, in science, in history, in geography,
and in English that we must meet today, standards that were not
necessary to meet even 10 or 20 years ago."</P>

<P>So, let's get started by finding an activity in this book and trying
it.</P>

<h3><a name="Introduction"> Introduction</a></h3>


<P>Why is the sky blue?  <BR>
Why do things fall to the ground?  <BR>
How do seeds grow?  <BR>
What makes sound and music?  <BR>
Where do mountains come from?  </P>

<P>Young children ask their parents hundreds of questions like these. In
search of answers, we use science to both enlighten and delight.</P>

<P>As parents, we must prepare our children for a world vastly different
from the one in which we grew up. In the next century, this country
will need citizens with more training in science and technology than
most of us had in school. </P>

<P>Even children who don't want to be scientists, engineers, or com-
puter technicians will need science to cope with their rapidly
changing environment. But without our help, our children will not be
prepared for these changes. </P>

<P>This book suggests ways you can interest your children from about 3 to
10 years old in science. It includes:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Some basic information about science; <BR><BR>

	<LI>    A sampling of activities for children to do --some alone, some
     	with supervision--in both the home and the community; and<BR><BR>


<LI>    An Appendex with practical tips on how to encourage schools to
     develop good science programs, a brief description of nine
     scientific concepts, and a list of  recommended science books and
     magazines.  <BR><BR>
</UL>
<P>Many of the activities cost little or nothing and require no special
equipment.</P>

<B>Science Starts at Home</B>

<P>We play a crucial role in determining how much science our children
learn. Our enthusiasm and encouragement can spark their interest.
Fortunately, youngsters of all ages are curious and love to
investigate. And the earlier we encourage this curiosity, the better. </P>

<P>Scientific knowledge is cumulative, so children need to start learning
early--at home. Many of us assume that children will learn all the
science they need at school. The fact is that most children,
particularly in elementary school, are taught very little science. </P>


<B>How You Can Help
</B>
<P>As parents, we don't have to have a strong background in science to
help our children learn science. What's far more important than
knowing what sound is or how a telescope works, is having a positive
attitude about  science.</P>

<P>Every day is filled with opportunities to learn science--without
expensive chemistry sets or books. Children can easily be
introduced to the natural world and encouraged to observe what goes on
around them. </P>

<P>Together, parents and children can-- </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    See how long it takes for a dandelion or a rose to burst into full
     	bloom; or<BR><BR>

<LI>   Watch the moon as it appears to change shape over the course of a
     month, and record the changes; or<BR><BR>

<LI>   Watch a kitten grow into a cat.<BR><BR>

<LI>   Bake a cake; <BR><BR>

<LI>    Guess why one of your plants is drooping; or<BR><BR>

<LI>    Figure out how the spin cycle of the washing machine gets the
     water out of the clothes.
</UL>
<P>Learning to observe objects carefully is an important step leading to
scientific explanations. Experiencing the world together and
exchanging information about what we see are important, too. </P>

<P>A nasty head cold can even be turned into a chance to learn science. We
can point out that there is no known cure for a cold, but that we do
know how diseases are passed from person to person.  Or we can teach
some ways to stay healthy--such as washing our hands, not sharing
forks, spoons, or glasses, and covering our nose and mouth when we
sneeze or cough.</P>


<B>Questioning and Listening</B>

<P>We should encourage our children to ask questions. A friend once asked
Isidor I. Rabi, a Nobel prize winner in physics, "Why did you become a
scientist, rather than a doctor or lawyer or businessman, like the
other immigrant kids in your neighborhood?" Rabi responded:</P>

<P>My mother made me a scientist without ever intending it. Every
other Jewish mother in Brooklyn would ask her child after school:
"So? Did you learn anything today?" But not my mother. She always
asked me a different question. "Izzy," she would say, "did you ask
a good question today?" That difference--asking good questions--
made me become a scientist!</P>

<P>If we can't answer all of our children's questions, that's all right--
no one has all the answers, even scientists. And children don't need
lengthy, detailed answers to  all of their questions. We can propose
answers, test them out, and check them with someone else. The library,
or even the dictionary, can help answer questions. </P>

<P>We can also encourage our children to tell us their ideas and listen to
their explanations. Being listened to will help them to gain confidence
in their thinking and to develop their skills and interest in science.
Listening helps us to determine just what children know and don't know.
(It also helps the child figure out what he or she knows.) </P>

<P>Simple activities can help to demystify science--and we will suggest
some of these later. But children also need to learn some basic
information about science and about how to think scientifically. The
following section contains information for parents that can point our
children toward this goal.</P>

<h3><a name="The Basics"> The Basics</a></h3>


<B>What Is Science?
</B>
<P>Science is not just a collection of facts. Facts are a part  of
science. We all need to know some basic scientific information:  water
freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit (or 0 degrees celsius), and the earth
moves around the sun. But science is much more.  It includes:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Observing what's happening;
	<LI>    Predicting what might happen;
	<LI>    Testing predictions under controlled conditions to see if they are
     	correct; and
	<LI>    Trying to make sense of our observations.
</UL>

<P>Science fiction writer Isaac Asimov describes science as "a way of
thinking," a way to look at the world. </P>

<P>Science also involves trial and error--trying, failing, and trying
again. Science does not provide all the answers. It requires us to be
skeptical so that our scientific "conclusions" can be modified or
changed altogether as we make new discoveries.  </P>

<B>Children Have Their Own Ideas</B>

<P>Children develop their own ideas about the physical world, ideas that
reflect their special perspectives. Below are some perceptions from
some sixth grade students:</P>
<blockquote>
     "Fossils are bones that animals are through  wearing."<BR><BR>

     "Some people can tell what time it is by looking at the sun, but I
     have never been able to make out the numbers."<BR><BR>

     "Gravity is stronger on the earth than on the moon because here on
     earth we have a bigger mess."<BR><BR>

     "A blizzard is when it snows sideways."<BR><BR>
</blockquote>
<P>Children's experiences help them form their ideas, and these often
don't match current scientific interpretations.  We need to allow our
children to ask questions and make mistakes without feeling "stupid."  </P>

<P>We can help our children look at things in new ways. For instance, in
regard to the blizzard, we could ask:  "Have you ever seen it snow
sideways? What do you think causes it to move sideways sometimes?"</P>

<B>Hands-On Works Best</B>

<P>Children, especially younger ones, learn science best and
understand scientific ideas better if they are able to investigate and
experiment. Hands-on science can also help children think critically
and gain confidence in their own ability to solve problems. Some
science teachers have explained it this way: </P>
<blockquote>
     What engages very young children? Things they can see, touch,
     manipulate, modify; situations that allow them to figure out what
     happens--in short, events and puzzles that they can investigate,
     which is the very stuff of science.
</blockquote>

<P>But, hands-on science can be messy and time consuming. So, before you
get started, see what is involved in an activity--including how long it
will take.</P>

<B>Less Is More</B>

It's tempting to try to teach our children just a little about many
different subjects.

While youngsters can't possibly learn everything about science, they do
need and will want to learn many facts. But the best way to help them
learn to think scientifically is to introduce them to just a few topics
in depth. <P></P>

<B>Finding the Right Activity for Your Child </B>

<P>Different children have different interests and need different science
projects. A sand and rock collection that was a big hit with an 8-year-
old daughter may not be a big hit with a 6-year-old son.</P>

<P>Fortunately, all types of children can find plenty of projects that
are fun. If your child loves to cook, let him or her observe how sugar
melts into caramel syrup or how vinegar curdles milk. </P>

<P>Knowing our children is the best way to find suitable  activities. Here
are some tips:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Encourage activities that are neither too hard nor too easy. If in
     doubt, err on the easy side since something too difficult may give
     the idea that science itself is too hard.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Age suggestions on book jackets or toy containers are just that--
     suggestions. They may not reflect the interest or ability of your
     child. A child who is interested in a subject can often handle
     material for a higher age group, while a child who isn't
     interested in or hasn't been exposed to the subject may need to
     start with something for a younger age group.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Consider a child's personality and social habits. Some projects
     are best done alone, others in a group; some require help, others
     require little or no supervision. Solitary activities may bore
     some, while group projects may frighten others.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Select activities appropriate for the child's environment. A
     brightly lighted city isn't the best place for star-gazing, for
     example.<BR><BR>

<LI>   Allow your children to help select the activities. If you don't
     know whether Sarah would rather collect shells or plant daffodils,
     ask her.  When she picks something she wants to do, she'll learn
     more and have a better time doing it.<BR><BR>

<h3><a name="Important Things To Learn">Important Things to Learn </a></h3>


<B>Basic Concepts</B>

<P>Elementary school children can be introduced gradually to nine basic
scientific concepts--ones that all scientists learn. These concepts are
listed at the end of this handbook. The concepts provide a framework
into which  scientific facts can be placed. </P>

<P>We will introduce three of these concepts (in this section) that you
can easily introduce to your children at home or in the community. The
activities described in the next two sections of this book are based on
these concepts, as are many other simple science-related projects.</P>

<P>1. Organization </P>

<P>Scientists like to find patterns and classify natural occurrences. We
can encourage our children to think about objects according to their
size or color--for instance, rocks, hills, mountains, and planets. Or
they can observe leaves or insects and group the ones that are similar.</P>

<P>2. Change</P>

<P>The natural world changes continually. Some objects change rapidly;
some at a rate too slow to observe. We can encourage our children to
look for changes in things:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    What happens to breakfast cereal when we pour milk on it?


<LI>     What happens over time when a plant isn't watered or exposed to
     proper sunlight?

<LI>      What changes can be reversed? Once water is turned into ice cubes,
     can it be turned back into water? Yes. But if an apple is cut into
     slices, can the slices be changed back into the whole apple?
</UL>
<P>3. Diversity </P>

<P>Even very young children know that there are many kinds of objects.
One thing to do is help your child explore and investigate a pond.
Within and around a single pond (depending on the size and location of
the pond), there may be tremendous diversity: insects, birds, fish,
frogs, turtles, other water creatures, and maybe some mammals. Looking
at a pond is a great way to learn about the habits, life cycles, and
feeding patterns of  different organisms.  </P>

<B>Integrity </B>

<P>The early years of elementary school are a good time to start teaching
children scientific ethics. We should tell them how important it is to
be accurate about their observations. They need to know it's all right
to make mistakes--we all make mistakes, and we can learn from them. But
explain that important discoveries are made only if we are willing and
able to correct our mistakes. </P>

<P>Help your children understand that we can't always take someone else's
word for something. That's why it's important to find out for
ourselves. </P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<h3><a name="Activities at Home"> Activities at Home  </a></h3>


<P>This section contains a sampling of science activities-- organized
roughly from easiest to most difficult--suitable for children from
preschool through the early elementary grades. In a box near the end of
each activity are a few facts and explanations for those who want them.
But exploring, questioning, and having a good time is more important
than memorizing facts. And,  although your children may be able to do
the following activities alone, we encourage you to join them.</P>

<B>Grown-Up Alert!</B>

<P>The activities in this book are safe with the appropriate
supervision. Some require help from an adult. Others can be carried
out by children alone, if they are old enough. Look in the
instructions for the Grown-up alert! It will highlight an activity
that may need supervision. Be sure your children who can read know
which  activities you do not want them to try by themselves.  </P>

<P>Young children may not fully understand that bad things can happen to
them.  We don't want to scare our children away from science, but we
must:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Provide supervision when it is appropriate--for example, when
     	using heat or mixing chemicals;


<LI>    Teach children not to taste anything unless they know it is good
     for them and is sanitary;

<LI> Insist children wear goggles whenever fire or splatter could
     endanger eyes;

<LI>    Teach children to follow warnings on manufacturers' labels and
     instructions;

<LI>    Keep toxic or other dangerous substances out of the reach of young
     children;

<LI>    Teach children what they can do to minimize the risk of accidents;
     and

<LI>    Teach children what to do if an accident occurs.
</UL>
<B>Results</B>

<P>Keeping records is an important part of science. It helps us remem-
ber what didn't work as well as what did work. Someone asked Thomas
Edison if he weren't discouraged after trying thousands of
experiments--without results--to make the incandescent light bulb work.
He replied: </P>
<blockquote>
     Results! Why, I have gotten a lot of results. I know several
     thousand things that won't work.
</blockquote>
<P>So before starting, get a notebook for recording observations. If your
children cannot write yet, they can draw pictures of what they see, or
you may want to take notes for them. </P>

<P>We should remember, too, that seeing isn't the only way to observe.
Sometimes we use other senses; we hear, feel, smell, or taste some
things (children should be careful, of course, about what they taste).</P>

<B>Let's Go</B>

<P>Science can be learned in many places and environments and just as
easily from everyday experiences as from formal projects and
experiments. We can get our children interested in science with simple
toys, books, and objects around the house and have fun while we're
doing it.</P>

<P>So, flip through the following pages and find something that looks
like fun. </P>

<B>The Big Picture</B>

<P>Looking at objects closely is an important part of science, and a
magnifying glass lets us see things we don't even know are there.  It
also helps us see how objects are similar or different from each
other. </P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>A magnifying glass <BR>
Your science journal</P>

<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Use your magnifying glass to see: </P>

<P>     What's hidden in soil or under leaves;<BR>
     What's on both sides of leaves;<BR>
     How mosquitos bite;<BR>
     Different patterns of snowflakes; and<BR>
     Butterfly wings.</P>

<P>     How many different objects can you find in the soil?</P>

<P>2.   Draw pictures, or describe what you see, in your notebook.</P>

<P>     If you were able to examine a mosquito, you probably saw how it
     bites something--with its proboscis, a long hollow tube that
     sticks out of its head.  Snowflakes are fascinating because no two
     are alike.  Powdery scales give butterfly wings their color.</P>

<a name="Attack of the Straws"></a>
<B>Attack of the Straws</B>

<P>Can a paper straw go through a raw  potato?  Here's an easy way to
learn about inertia and momentum.</P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>A raw potato<BR>
One or more paper straws<BR>
Your science journal</P>

<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Put a potato on the table or kitchen counter and hold it firmly
     with one hand, making sure the palm of your hand is not underneath
     the potato.*</P>

<P>2.   With a fast, strong push, stab the potato with the straw.</P>

<P>3.   What happens?  Did the straw bend?  The straw should go into the
     potato.  If it didn't, try again with another straw--maybe a
     little faster or harder. </P>

<P>*If the potato is old, soak it in water for about half an hour before
trying this activity.</P>

<P>     An object remains at rest (the potato, in this case) or keeps
     moving (the straw, in this case) unless it is acted upon by some
     external force.</P>

<hr>

<a name="Soap Power"></a>
<B>Soap Power</B>

<P>Have you ever tried using soap to power a boat?  This simple activity
works because of "surface tension."</P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>1 index card<BR>
Scissors<BR>
A baking dish (or sink full of water)<BR>
Liquid dish detergent<BR>
Your science journal<BR></P>

<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   From an index card, cut out a boat like this. Make it about 2 1/2
     inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide.</P>

<P>2.   Place the boat gently on the water in the dish.</P>

<P>3.   Pour a little detergent into the notch in the end of the boat.
     What happens?
     If you repeat the experiment, wash out the baking
     dish carefully each time you use detergent, or your boat won't go.</P>

<P>Your boat should zip across the water.  Water molecules are strongly
attracted to each other and stick close together, especially on the
surface.  This creates a strong but flexible "skin" on the water's
surface that we call surface tension.  Adding soap disrupts the
arrangement of the water molecules and breaks the skin, making the boat
go forward.</P>

<a name="Bubbles"></a>
<B>Bubbles</B>

<P>Who doesn't enjoy blowing bubbles?  You can make bubbles at home, and
they can be beautiful shapes and colors!</P>


<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>8 tablespoons of dishwashing liquid<BR>
1 quart water<BR>
1 drinking straw<BR>
A shallow tray<BR>
    </P>
<P>     Grown-up alert! </P>

<P>1 tin can, open at both ends <BR>
Your science journal<BR></P>


<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Mix the dishwashing liquid with the water.  Fill the shallow tray.</P>

<P>2.   Blow through your straw as you move it slowly across the surface
     of the solution. How big are the bubbles you get?</P>

<P>3.   Try making a very big bubble that covers the surface of the tray:</P>

<P>     Dip one end of the straw into the sudsy solution then hold the
     straw slightly above the surface of the solution.  Blow into it
     very gently. You may have to try several times to make a really
     big bubble. </P>

<P>     When you have made a bubble, touch it gently with a wet finger.
     What happens?</P>

<P>     Make another big bubble.  Touch this one with a dry finger.  What
     happens?</P>

<P>4.   Try making bubbles with a tin can (don't cut yourself) open at
     both ends.  Dip the can into the soapy solution so that you get a
     soap "window" across one end when you pull it out.  Blow gently on
     the other end to form a bubble.  You can use wider tubes such as
     coffee cans to make still bigger bubbles.</P>

<P>5.   Look closely at the bubbles you make.  How many colors can you
     see?  Do the colors change?</P>

<P>6.   If you have a wand at home that is left over from a bottle of
     bubbles you bought at the store, you can use it with this bubble
     solution.</P>

<P>Bubbles are bits of air or gas trapped inside a liquid ball.  The
surface of a bubble is very thin.  Bubbles are particularly fragile
when a dry object touches them.  That's because soap film tends to
stick to the object, which puts a strain on the bubble.  So if you
want your bubbles to last longer, keep everything wet, even the sides
of the straw.</P>

<a name="Bugs!"></a>
<B>Bugs!</B>

<P>Some bugs help us, some annoy us, and some are downright dangerous.
But you can learn a lot from bugs. </P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>An insect guide and a spider  <BR>
  guide from the bookstore or
  library--preferably ones
  with pictures<BR>
Your magnifying glass<BR>
Your science journal<BR></P>

<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Search your home and neighborhood for bugs.</P>

<P>               Grown-up Alert!</P>

<P>Look:</P>

<P>Around your front door <BR>
In cracks in the sidewalk <BR>
On lamps <BR>
On lights hanging from the center of the room <BR>
On plants <BR>
In crevices in drawers <BR>
In corners of rooms<BR></P>

<P>2.   Identify types of bugs using the guides. Did you find:   </P>

<P>     Ants? <BR>
     Spiders? <BR>
     Fleas? <BR>
     Silverfish?  <BR>
     Moths? <BR>
     Flies? <BR>
     Ladybugs? <BR></P>

<P>3.   Ants can teach us how some insects work together as a community.
    </P>
<P>     Watch ants scurry in and out of their ant hills or find some
     spilled food on the sidewalk. </P>

<P>     Do they eat their food on the spot, or carry it back to their
     anthill?</P>

<P>     When an ant finds food, it runs back to the hill to "tell" the
     others.  As it runs, it leaves a trail that other ants in the hill
     can smell.  The ants find the food by smelling their way along the
     trail. </P>

<P>4.   Find out what the difference is between an insect and a spider.
    </P>
<P>     Why do spiders spin webs?  <BR>
     What are webs made of?</P>

<P>5.   Write down possible answers to all these questions in your journal
     or draw pictures of what you see.</P>

<P>Bugs do what they do to survive.  They are constantly looking for food.
Some bugs are both good and bad.  Termites, for example, have a nasty
reputation because they destroy peoples houses by eating the wood.  But
they also break down old trees, keeping the forest floor from becoming
too cluttered with dead trees.</P>

<a name="It Floats!"></a>
<B>It Floats!</B>

<P>We don't usually stop to wonder why a big cruise ship can float as
well as a feather.  This activity helps to explain.</P>


<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>1 solid wood building block<BR>
1 plastic cap from a bottle<BR>
2 pieces of  aluminum foil  (heavy duty if you have it)<BR>
1 chunk of clay</P>

<P>     Grown-up alert!</P>

<P>1 pair of pliers <BR>
1 bathtub (or sink) filled with water<BR>
Your science journal</P>

<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Hold the wood block in one hand and the plastic cap in the other
     hand. </P>

<P>     Which one feels heavier? <BR>
     Do you think the wooden block will float,
       or will it sink? <BR>
     Will the plastic cap float, or sink?</P>

<P>2.   Put both of them on the water to test your predictions.  What
     happens?  Put both of them under the water.  What happens now?</P>

<P>3.   Take a piece of aluminum foil and squeeze it into a solid ball
     with the pliers.  Drop it in the water.  Does it float or sink? </P>

<P>4.   Get another piece the same size and shape it into a little boat.
     Place it on top of the water.  Does it float now?</P>

<P>5.   Try the same experiment with clay.  Make a ball and drop it in the
     water.  What happens?</P>

<P>6.   Shape the clay into a boat and put it on the water.  Does it float
     now?</P>

<P>The clay and foil balls sink because they are squeezed into small
shapes, and only a small amount of water is trying to hold up the
weight.  When you spread out the clay or foil, it floats because the
weight is supported by a lot more water.</P>

<P>Oil the hinges of a door and it will stop squeaking. Rub petroleum
jelly on lips  to prevent them from becoming chapped. These slippery
substances are called lubricants. They are very important in modern
technology.</P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>4 envelopes unflavored gelatin<BR>
Square baking pan<BR>
A mixing bowl<BR>
Liquid dish detergent<BR>
Vegetable oil<BR>
2 bowls<BR>
A watch with a second hand<BR>
    </P>
<P>     Grown-up alert!</P>

<P>A table knife<BR>
8-ounce cup<BR>
Your science journal</P>


<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   In a mixing bowl, dissolve the 4 envelopes of  gelatin in 2 cups
     of hot tap water.</P>

<P>2.   Coat the inside of the pan with vegetable oil.  Pour the gelatin
     mixture into the pan and put it  in the refrigerator until firm
     (about 3 to 4 hours).</P>

<P>3.   Use the knife to cut the gelatin into cubes about 1 x 1 x 1 inch.
     You should have about 64 cubes.</P>

<P>4.   Place 15 cubes into a bowl.  Place the second bowl about 6 inches
     (about 15 centimeters) away from the cube bowl.</P>

<P>5.   When your parent or a friend says "go," start picking up the
     gelatin cubes one at a time with your thumb and index finger
     (don't squeeze!).  See how many cubes you can transfer to the
     other bowl in 15 seconds.</P>

<P>          Grown-up alert!</P>

<P>     Do not eat the gelatin cubes after they have been handled or after
     they are covered with lubricant.</P>

<P>6.   Put all the cubes back in the first bowl.  Pour 1/4 cup dish
     detergent over the cubes.  Gently mix the detergent and the cubes
     so that the cubes  are well-coated.</P>

<P>7.   Use the same method as before to transfer as many cubes as
     possible in 15 seconds.</P>

<P>8.   Throw away the cubes and detergent and wash and dry both bowls.
     Put about 15 new cubes into one bowl and pour 1/4 cup water over
     the cubes, again making sure the cubes are thoroughly coated.  See
     how many cubes you can transfer  in 15 seconds.</P>

<P>9.   Throw away the cubes and water.  Put about 15 new cubes into one
     bowl.  Pour 1/4 cup of vegetable oil over the cubes.  Make sure
     they are well coated.  See how many cubes you can transfer in 15
     seconds. </P>

<P>10.  With which liquid were you able to transfer the most cubes?  With
     which liquid were you able to transfer the fewest cubes?  Which
     was the best lubricant (the slipperiest)?  Which was the worst?</P>

<P>Cars, trucks, airplanes, and machines all have parts that rub against
one another.  These parts would heat up, wear down, and stop working if
we didn't have lubricants.  Lubricants reduce the amount of friction
between 2 surfaces that move against each other.</P>

<a name="Celery Stalks at Midnight"></a>
<B>Celery Stalks at Midnight</B>

<P>Did you ever wonder how a paper towel can soak up a spill, or how
water gets from a plant's roots to its leaves? The name for this is
"capillary action."</P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>4 same-size stalks of fresh celery with leaves <BR>
4 cups or glasses</P>

<P>     Grown-up alert!</P>

<P>Red and blue food coloring<BR>
A measuring cup <BR>
4 paper towels <BR>
A vegetable peeler <BR>
A ruler <BR>
Some old newspapers <BR>
Your science journal</P>

<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Lay the 4 pieces of celery in a row on a cutting board or counter
     so that the place where the stalks and the leaves meet matches up.
    </P>
<P>2.   Cut all 4 stalks of celery 4 inches (about 10 centimeters) below
     where the stalks and leaves meet.</P>

<P>3.   Put the 4 stalks in 4 separate cups of purple water (use 10 drops
     of red and 10 drops of blue food color for each half cup of
     water). </P>

<P>4.   Label 4 paper towels in the following way: "2 hours," "4 hours,"
     "6 hours," and "8 hours." (You may need newspapers under the
     towels). </P>

<P>5.   Every 2 hours from the time you put the celery into the cups,
     remove 1 of the stalks and put  onto the correct towel. (Notice
     how long it takes for the leaves to start to change.)</P>

<P>6.   Each time you remove a stalk from the water, carefully peel the
     rounded part with a vegetable peeler to see how far up the stalk
     the purple water has traveled.  </P>

<P>7.   What do you observe?
     Notice how fast the water climbs the celery.
     Does this change as time goes by? In what way? </P>

<P>8.   Measure the distance it has traveled and record this amount in
     your science journal. </P>

<P>9.   Make a list of other objects around your house or in nature that
     enable liquids to climb by capillary action.
     Look for paper towels, sponges, old sweat socks, brown paper bags,
     and flowers.  </P>

<P>     What other items can you find?</P>

<P>Capillary action happens when water molecules are more attracted to the
surface they travel along than to each other.  In paper towels, the
molecules move along tiny fibers.  In plants, they move through narrow
tubes that are actually called capillaries.  Plants couldn't survive
without capillaries because they use the water to make their food.</P>

<a name="Sticky Stuff"></a>
<B>Sticky Stuff</B>

<P>Adhesives are used to stick things together.  Many adhesives we use
every day are made in factories.  Others occur in nature and have
important uses for plants and animals.</P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>Baking flour<BR>
Measuring cup<BR>
Egg white<BR>
Food coloring<BR>
4 small bowls<BR>
4 plastic spoons<BR>
Aluminum foil<BR>
Cotton balls<BR>
Toothpicks<BR>
Bits of cloth<BR>
Glitter<BR>
Blunt-tip scissors<BR>
Colored yarn or ribbon<BR>
Colored paper<BR>
Your science journal</P>

<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Search your home to track down everything you can that is sticky.
     See how many of the following you can find:</P>

<P>          Grown-up alert!</P>

<P>     Tape<BR>
     Postage stamps <BR>
     Car bumper sticker  <BR>
     Envelopes containing glue<BR>
     Honey <BR>
     Wall paper with glue <BR>
     A decal on a t-shirt <BR>
     Spackle <BR>
     A bicycle tire patch <BR>
     Glue for fake fingernails <BR>
     Peanut butter <BR>
     An adhesive bandage </P>

<P>2.   Make a list of everything you can find in nature with an adhesive.
     For example:</P>

<P>     Barnacles that stick to boats, ships, and rocks  <BR>
     Spiders that use sticky threads to create webs
          that trap their food
     Pine trees that produce sticky sap</P>

<P>3.   What adhesives can you think of that are used </P>

<P>     in hospitals?   <BR>
     in offices?  <BR>
     in auto repair shops?</P>

<P>4.   Make a poster or collage using adhesives.</P>

<P>     Make 3 bowls of flour-and-water paste.  In each bowl, add 1/4 cup
     water to 1/2 cup flour and mix until smooth.  Add a different
     colored food coloring to each of the 3 bowls and mix.</P>

<P>     Crack open an egg and separate the white into a bowl.  Throw away
     the yolk.  The white is your clear glue.  </P>

<P>     Make shapes on your poster or collage out of the colored flour and
     water paste. Use the egg white to attach aluminum foil, cotton
     balls, toothpicks, cloth, glitter, ribbon, yarn, and colored
     paper.</P>

<P>What makes glue, paste, or tape stick to things?  Wood, paper, and many
other materials have tiny cracks and holes in them.  When we glue
things together, sometimes the glue seeps into the tiny openings and
hardens, making the materials stick together.  Other times, the
molecules on the surface of an object get tangled up with the glue
molecules, making the objects stick together.  Finally, glue may stick
because of a chemical reaction.</P>

<P>There are many ways to measure things. At bath time, use different
sized containers to measure volume.  </P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>Measuring spoons and cups of different sizes<BR>
Milk containers of different
  sizes--for example, pint,
  quart, half-gallon, and
  gallon (or 1 liter, 2 liter,
  and 4 liter)
A funnel <BR>
2 containers that hold the
  same amount (such as a 1
  or 2 quart pitcher and
  storage bowl), but are
  different shapes--one tall
  and thin, and one short
  and squat </P>

<P>     Grown-up alert!</P>

<P>1 bathtub or sink filled with water
Your science journal</P>

<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Fill a small container (such as a quart) with water.  Then pour
     the water (using the funnel, if necessary) into a larger container
     (a half-gallon or gallon).  How many small containers does it take
     to fill one large one?</P>

<P>2.   How many tablespoons does it take to make half a cup?  And how
     many cups to make a quart?</P>

<P>3.   Find out how many quarts (or liters) it takes to fill a gallon (or
     a 4-liter container).</P>

<P>4.   Next, fill the gallon (or 4-liter) container, and use the funnel
     to pour the water into the little containers.  How many times will
     it fill the pint (or 1/2-liter) container?  </P>

<P>5.   Fill the short, squat container with a given amount of water--3
     cups, for example.  </P>

<P>     Pour this water into the tall, thin container.  </P>

<P>     Do your eyes try to tell you the tall, thin container holds more
     than the short, squat one?  Does it hold more?</P>

<P>     Can you write all this in your science journal?</P>

<P>Water and other liquids take the shape of whatever container they are
in.  Containers of certain sizes have names--cup, pint, quart, liter,
or gallon, for example.  This activity provides an introduction to
volume and measurement.</P>

<B>Hair-Raising Results</B>

<P>Have you ever been shocked when you walked across a rug or touched a
light switch? Wait until a cool, dry day to learn about static
electricity. </P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>A cool, dry day  <BR>
2 round balloons (inflated and tied)   <BR>
2 20-inch pieces of string   <BR>
1 wool or acrylic sock.   <BR>
1 mirror (or more)  <BR>
1 friend (or more)  <BR>
Your science journal</P>


<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Tie a string to each inflated balloon.  </P>

<P>2.   Rub a balloon on your hair for about 15 seconds.  Be sure to rub
     around the whole balloon.  </P>

<P>     What happens to your hair?   <BR>
     What happens when you bring the balloon back close to your hair?</P>

<P>3.   Rub the balloon on your hair again and have a friend (or parent)
     do the same with the other  balloon.
 </P>
<P>4.   Each of you hold the string to 1 balloon, letting the balloons
     hang freely, but without letting them touch anything.</P>

<P>5.   Slowly move the 2 balloons toward each other, but don't let them
     touch.  </P>

<P>     What do you see?   <BR>
     Do the balloons push away from each other, or do they pull toward
          each other?</P>

<P>6.   Place your hand between the two hanging  balloons.  </P>

<P>     What happens?  </P>

<P>7.   Place a sock over 1 hand and rub 1 balloon with the sock. Then let
     the balloon hang freely. Bring your sock-covered hand near the
     balloon.   </P>

<P>     What happens?  </P>

<P>8.   Try rubbing both balloons with the sock and then let them hang
     near each other. </P>

<P>     What happens now? </P>

<P>9.   Look for other examples of static electricity around the house.
    </P>
<P>     Have you ever felt a shock when you touched a metal doorknob on a
     cold winter day?  What often happens when you remove the clothes
     from the dryer?</P>

<P>All materials contain millions of tiny particles, called protons and
electrons, that have electric charges.  Protons have positive charges,
and electrons negative ones.  Usually, they balance each other, but
sometimes when two surfaces rub together, some of the electrons rub off
one surface onto the other and we can have static electricity.
Materials with like charges (all positive or all negative) move away
from each other; those with opposite charges attract each other.</P>

<P>Molds are tiny microscopic plants that can help or hurt us. Molds like
some environmental conditions better than others. Find out which ones
they prefer by watching mold grow.</P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>     Grown-up alert!</P>

<P>3 cups containing a little
  coffee or leftover food.  <BR>
Your magnifying glass.  <BR>
Your science journal.</P>

<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Put 1 cup with coffee or leftover food on a sunny windowsill, 1 in
     the refrigerator, and 1 in a dark  cupboard.</P>

<P>     Look inside the cups every day for several days and write down
     what you see.  Your magnifying glass will help. (It may take a few
     days for the mold to start growing.)</P>

<P>2.   Does temperature affect the mold's growth?  See if the cup left on
     the windowsill grows mold </P>

<P>     more slowly,   <BR>
     more quickly, or  <BR>
     at the same rate as the one in the refrigerator.</P>

<P>3.   Does light affect the growth of the mold?  </P>

<P>     Does the cup on the windowsill grow mold at the same rate as the
     one in a dark cupboard?</P>

<P>4.   Look around your home for other molds. Inspect:</P>

<P>     Pickles in a jar  <BR>
     Cottage cheese  <BR>
     Bread  <BR>
     Paint on the walls  <BR>
     Oranges  <BR>
     House plants  <BR>
     Tiles around the bathtub or shower.</P>

<P>6.   Are the molds all the same color, or are they  different?</P>

<P>We can find molds in all sorts of unexpected places.  Unlike green
plants, they can't make their own food from sunlight.  Instead, they
live directly off of what they are growing on.</P>

<P>Molds can be a nuisance when they settle on our food or possessions.
But molds are also useful.  The green spots on old oranges are
penicillin mold.  This is what the medicine is made from.</P>

<a name="Plants"></a>
<B>Plants</B>

<P>Plants are the only things on earth that turn sunlight into food.
They do it through a process called photosynthesis, which is explored
in this activity.</P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>Some household plants
A book on plant care from a store or the library</P>

<P>     Grown-up alert!</P>

<P>Plant fertilizer </P>
Paper</P>
Scissors</P>
Your magnifying glass</P>
Your science journal</P>

<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Look in your plant-care book, or ask a grown-up, to find out how
     much water each plant needs. Some may need to be watered more than
     others.   </P>

<P>2.   Take two clippings from one plant.  Put one in a glass of water.
     Put the other one in a glass with no water.  Check each day to see
     how long the one without water can survive.</P>

<P>3.   Water the rest of the plants each week for several weeks.
     Fertilize some of the plants but not others during this time.
     Label the ones you fertilized.</P>

<P>4.   Record the following in your science journal for those plants that
     got fertilized and for those that didn't:</P>

<P>     Did any of the plants start to droop?</P>

<P>     Did any of the plants have yellow leaves that fell off?</P>

<P>     Did the plants grow toward the light?</P>

<P>5.   See what happens when a plant (or part of a plant) doesn't get any
     light:</P>

<P>     Cut 3 paper shapes about 2 inches by 2 inches. Circles and
     triangles work well, but you can experiment with other shapes,
     too. </P>

<P>     Clip them to the leaves of a plant, preferably one with large
     leaves.  Either an indoor or an outdoor plant will do.  Be very
     careful not to damage the plant.</P>

<P>     Leave one paper cutout on for 1 day, a second on for 2 days, and a
     third on for a week.</P>

<P>     How long does it take for the plant to react?  How long does it
     take for the plant to return to normal?</P>

<P>Photosynthesis means to "put together using light".  Plants use
sunlight to turn carbon dioxide from the air, and water into food.
Plants need all of these to remain healthy.  When the plant gets
enough of these things, it produces a simple sugar, which it uses
immediately or stores in a converted form of starch.  We don't know
exactly how this happens.  But we do know that chlorophyll, the green
substance in plants, helps it to occur.</P>

<P>3.   Do all of the crystals look the same?</P>

<P>     If not, how are they different?</P>

<P>4.   Try dissolving salt crystals and forming new ones:</P>

<P>     Dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt in 1 cup of water.</P>

<P>          Grown-up alert!</P>

<P>     Heat the mixture over a low flame to evaporate the water.</P>

<P>     What's left?</P>

<P>     What shape are these crystals?</P>

<P>5.   Snowflakes are made of ice crystals and are beautiful, but they
     are hard to see clearly. You can make paper snowflakes.</P>

<P>     Take a circle of paper (use thin paper) and fold it in half.  Then
     fan fold it.</P>

<P>     Make cuts along all the edges. Unfold them.</P>

<P>6.   Grow rock candy crystals from dissolved sugar. </P>

<P>          Grown-up alert!</P>

<P>     Pour a cup of boiling water into a dish and add  1 3/4 cups of
     sugar. Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved. Prepare a jar
     or glass as shown. </P>

<P>     Wash the paper clips and use clean string. When the sugar water is
     cool, pour it into the jar and put it where no one will move it.
     Hang the paperclips in the water and put the pencil on top of the
     jar. </P>

<P>     Some crystals may form in a few hours. Some may grow to be half an
     inch on each side. To save them, take them out of the water and
     keep them dry. But they may disappear--they are good to eat.   </P>

<P>When certain liquids and gases cool and lose water, crystals are
formed.  Crystals are made up of molecules that fit neatly together in
an orderly package.  All crystals of the same material have the same
shape, regardless of the size.</P>

<a name="Cake!"></a>
<B>Cake!</B>

<P>Learn about chemical reactions by baking 4 small cakes, leaving an
important ingredient out of 3 of them. The ingredients are only for 1
cake, so you'll need to measure and mix 4 times.</P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>A small soup or cereal bowl  <BR>
Several layers of aluminum foil <BR>
A pie pan <BR>
Cooking oil to grease the "cake pans" <BR>
Measuring spoons <BR>
A cup or small bowl for the egg <BR>
A small mixing bowl <BR>
Your science journal</P>

<P>Ingredients  (for one cake)</P>

<P>6 tablespoons flour <BR>
3 tablespoons sugar <BR>
Pinch of salt  <BR>
2 or 3 pinches baking powder  <BR>
2 tablespoons milk <BR>
2 tablespoons cooking oil <BR>
1/4 teaspoon vanilla <BR>
Part of an egg (Break egg into a cup, beat until mixed. Use 1/3 of it.
  Save the rest for 2 of the other cakes.)</P>


<P>What to do</P>

<P>1.   Wrap several layers of aluminum foil around the outside of a
     cereal or soup bowl to form a mold.  </P>

<P>2.   Remove your foil "pan" and put it in a pie pan for support.  </P>

<P>3.   Oil the "inside" of your foil pan with cooking oil so the cake
     doesn't stick.</P>

<P>          Grown-up alert!</P>

<P>4.   Turn the oven on to 350 degrees.  </P>

<P>5.   Mix all of the dry ingredients together.
       Add the wet ones (only use 1/3 of the egg).  Stir until smooth
       and all the same color. </P>

<P>6.   Pour batter into the "pan." </P>

<P>7.   Bake for 15 minutes.</P>

<P>8.   Bake 3 more cakes:</P>

<P>       Leave the oil out of one.   <BR>
       Leave the egg out of another.   <BR>
       Leave the baking powder out of the third.<BR>
     Cut each cake in half and look at the insides.<BR>
       Do they look different?   <BR>
       Do they taste different?</P>

<P>9.   Write about, or draw pictures of, what you see and taste. </P>

<P>Heat helps some chemical reactions to occur as the cake bakes:</P>

<P>It helps baking powder produce tiny bubbles of gas making the cake
light and fluffy (this is called leavening).</P>

<P>It causes protein from the egg to change and make the cake firm.</P>

<P>Oil keeps the heat from drying out the cake.</P>

<a name="Television"></a>
<B>Television</B>

<P>Science can be learned from television. Even though the quality varies
a lot, some programs provide a marvelous window on science.  What to do</P>

<P>What you'll need</P>

<P>A television set<BR>
A VCR, if you have one<BR>
Your science journal</P>

<P>What to do </P>

<P>1.   Look on the regular networks, public television stations, and
     cable channels (The Discovery Channel, for example) for science
     programs such as 3-2-1 Contact, Reading Rainbow, Nature, Nova,
     Newton's Apple, The Voyage of the MIMI, Mr. Wizard's World, and
     National Geographic, Jacques Cousteau, Cosmos, and Smithsonian
     Institution specials. </P>

<P>2.   Look for reports of scientific discoveries and activities on
     regularly scheduled news programs, and for TV characters with
     science-related jobs--doctors, for instance.</P>

<P>3.   If you have a VCR, tape science shows so you can look at them
     later and stop--or replay--parts that are particulary interesting
     or hard to understand and so you can talk to someone about them.</P>

<P>4.   Watch some of these programs with an adult so you can ask
     questions.</P>

<P>Some TV programs give misleading information about science as well as
about scientists.  It is important to know which things on television
are real and which ones aren't.</P>

<h3><a name="Activities in the Community">Activities in the  Community</a></h3>


<P>Our communities provide still more opportunities to learn science. </P>

<P><B>Zoos</B></P>

<P>Almost all children enjoy a trip to the zoo.  We can use zoos to
encourage our child's interest in the natural world and to introduce
children to the many fascinating forms of life.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> 	 Guessing games can help your child understand structure and
     function.  "Why do you think the seal has flippers?"  (The seal
     uses flippers to swim through the water.)  "Why do you think the
     gibbons have such long and muscular arms?"  (Their arms help them
     swing through the trees.)  "Why does the armadillo have a head
     that looks like it's covered with armor, as well as a body that's
     covered with small, bony plates?"  (The armor and the small, bony
     plates protect it from being attacked by predators.)  "Why is the
     snake the same brown color as the ground on which it spends most
     of its time?" (As snakes evolved, the brown ones didn't get eaten
     as quickly.)  As your children mature, they will understand more
     complex answers to these  questions.<BR><BR>

<LI>      Children can learn about organization by seeing related animals.
     Have them compare the sizes, leg shapes, feet, ears, claws,
     feathers, or scales of various creatures.  Ask them, "Does the
     lion look like a regular cat?"  "How are they the same?"  "Does
     the gorilla look like the baboon?"
</UL>
<P>Here are a few suggestions to help make your visit worthwhile: </P>

<P>Discuss expectations with your children ahead of time. What do they
think they'll find at the zoo?  Very young or insecure children may go
to the zoo with a more positive attitude if they are assured that it
has food stands, water fountains, and bathrooms.</P>

<P>Don't try to see everything in one visit. Zoos are such busy places
that they can overwhelm youngsters, particularly preschoolers and
those in primary grades. </P>

<P>Try to visit zoos at off times or hours (in winter,  for example, or
very early on a Saturday morning).  This provides some peace and quiet
and gives children unobstructed views of the animals. </P>

<P>Look for special exhibits and facilities for children, such as "family
learning labs" or petting zoos.  Here, children can touch and examine
animals and engage in projects specially designed for them.  For
example, at the HERPlab (derived from the word herpetology) at the
National Zoo in Washington, D.C., visitors can learn about reptiles and
amphibians by doing everything from assembling a turtle skeleton to
locating the different parts of a snake.</P>

<P>Plan follow-up activities and projects.  A child who particularly
liked the flamingos and ducks may enjoy building a bird house for the
back yard.  One who liked the mud turtle may enjoy using a margarine
tub as a base to a papier-mache turtle.</P>

<B>Museums</B>

<P>Museums are designed today to interest visitors of all ages.  Science
and technology museums, natural history museums, and children's museums
can be found in many middle-sized and smaller communities like
Bettendorf, Iowa, and Worland, Wyoming, as well as in large
metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. </P>

<P>Museums vary in quality.  If possible, seek out those that provide
opportunities for hands-on activities.  Look for museums with: </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>   Levers to pull;

	<LI>   Lights to switch on;

<LI>    Buttons to push;

<LI>    Animals to stroke; and

<LI>    Experiments to do.
</UL>

<P>Natural history museums sometimes have hands-on rooms where children
can stroke everything from lizards to Madagascan hissing cockroaches. </P>

<P>Many museums offer special science classes.  Look for omnitheaters.
These enable visitors to see movies on subjects ranging from space
launches to rafting on the Amazon projected on a giant screen.  The
sounds and sights of the experience are extremely realistic.  </P>

<P>If you are unfamiliar with museums in your area, consult a librarian,
the Yellow Pages of your telephone book, a local guidebook, or the
local newspapers, which often list special exhibits.</P>

<P>Many tips for visiting the zoo are also helpful when you visit museums
or other community facilities.  For example, don't try to cover too
much on one visit, and do try visiting at off hours when the crowds
won't seem  overwhelming.</P>

<B>Planetariums</B>

<P>Planetariums have wonderful exhibits and activities for youngsters.
There are about 1,000 planetariums in the United States, ranging from
small ones that hold about 20 people to giant facilities with 300 or
more seats.  These facilities are particularly useful for children in
urban areas, where metropolitan lights and pollution  obstruct one's
view of the solar system. Inside  planetariums, children often can: </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Use telescopes to view the rings of Saturn;
	
<LI>    See the "sky" with vivid clarity from inside the  planetarium's
     dome; and

<LI>    Step on scales to learn what they would weigh on the moon or on
     Mars.
</UL>
<P>To find the nearest planetarium, call the astronomy or physics
department at a local college, your local science museum, or the
science curriculum specialist or science teachers in your school
district.</P>

<B>Aquariums</B>

<P>Aquariums enable youngsters to see everything from starfish to
electric eels. Children particularly enjoy feeding times. Call ahead to
find out when the penguins, sharks, and other creatures get to eat. And
check for  special shows with sea lions and dolphins.</P>

<B>Farms</B>

<P>A visit to a farm makes a wonderful field trip for elementary school
youngsters. But parents can also arrange visits. If you don't know a
farmer, call the closest 4-H Club for a referral. Consider dairy farms,
as well as vegetable, poultry, hog, and tree farms.</P>

<P>On a dairy farm, see the cows close up, view silos, and learn what
cows eat.  Find out from the farmer:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Up to what age do calves drink only milk?

	<LI>    When do they add other items to their diets?  What are they?

	<LI>    Why are the various foods a cow eats nutritious?
</UL>

<P>A visit to a farm also enables children to identify the difference
between calves, heifers, and cows; to watch the cows being milked; to
see farm equipment; to sit on tractors; and to ask questions about how
tractors work.</P>

<P>If you visit a vegetable farm, encourage your children to look at the
crops and ask questions about how they grow.  If your children grew up
in an urban area, they may have no idea what potatoes or beans look
like growing in a field.  </P>

<B>People Who Use Science in Their Work
</B>
<P>See if your children can spend part of a day or even an hour with a
park ranger, pharmacist, veterinarian, chemist, engineer, or
laboratory technician. This can teach the importance of science for
many jobs. Before the visit, encourage your children to read about the
work so they will be able to ask good questions during the visit. </P>

<B>Nature Hikes
</B>
<P>Many communities have parks, forests, or nature areas in which to
walk. Some of these have centers where visitors can do everything from
observe beehives to learn about flora and fauna. If these facilities
are unavailable, walk around your neighborhood and help your children:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Collect and identify leaves or rocks;

	<LI>    Observe pigeons, squirrels, butterflies, ants, or spider webs;

	<LI>    Observe differences among the dogs and cats you see; and

	<LI>    Talk about the special features of the birds and  flowers you
     	encounter.
	<LI>
</UL>
<B>Science Groups and Organizations
</B>
<P>There are special groups and organizations for children in many
communities.  Check out:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, or Camp Fire, Inc.;

	<LI>    Y.M.C.A.s or Y.W.C.A.s;

	<LI>    4--H groups; or

	<LI>    The National Audubon Society.
</UL>

<P>Some groups focus solely on a particular science activity--ham radios,
for instance, or computers.  Schools sometimes organize groups for
students with special  science interests.</P>

<B>Science Camps</B>

<P>Contact the National Audubon Society, which runs ecology camps, the
National Wildlife Federation's Ranger Rick Wildlife Camp in North
Carolina (which is a good choice for children who love nature); or the
U.S. Space Camp at Huntsville, Alabama. (See Notes section.) </P>

<B>Other Community Resources
</B>
<P>Look into botanical gardens, weather stations, hospital
laboratories, sewage treatment plants, newspaper plants, radio and
television stations, and after school programs such as Hands On
Science Outreach, Inc., (HOSO) or a Challenger Center.</P>

<B>Learning from Toys
</B>
<P>Children don't need fancy science toys or kits to learn  science. But
if you want to buy some for your children, plenty are
available. Look in toy stores, hobby shops, other specialty shops, or
in catalogs. It is beyond the scope of this booklet to recommend
specific toys.  However, these tips can guide you:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Children may not benefit if a toy or activity is a poor match for
     	their interests or temperaments.<BR><BR>


<LI>    Learn what the toy can and cannot do before you buy it. Many
     youngsters have looked through a toy telescope and been
     disappointed when they couldn't see bumps and craters on the moon.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Read instructions carefully so you gain everything  possible from
     the toy.<BR><BR>
</UL>
<B>In the Library and the Bookstore</B>

<P>Libraries and bookstores have a growing number of books to teach
children science.  Many are educational, beautifully illustrated, and
fun to read.  But science can also be learned from "non-science" books,
such as fiction, biographies, autobiographies, and history books.</P>

<P>When selecting books, remember that recommended reading levels printed
on the jackets or backs of books are not always helpful.  After the
third grade, what children read is usually based as much on interest as
it is on reading level.</P>

<P>The National Science Teachers Association asks a range of questions
when evaluating books for young people:</P>

<P>Is the author reliable? Does the author have a good background and
reputation? Is the content interesting to children? Is the sequence of
events logical? Is the material accurate? Is the format pleasant? Are
the illustrations  accurate, and do they match the text? Is the
vocabulary appropriate? (Big words are OK as long as they are explained
and used in context.) Are biases evident (biases against race, sex, or
nationality)? Does the book glorify violence? Are controversies handled
fairly?</P>

<P>Are the suggested activities safe?  Practical?</P>

<P>If you need help in selecting books, consult a children's  librarian or
bookstore clerk.</P>

<B><I>Parents and the Schools</I></B><BR><BR>

Educators and policymakers are working to improve elementary school
science, but parents also can help.  Here's how:
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">

	<LI>  Visit your child's elementary school and see what kind of
     	science instruction is available. During your visit, look for
     	clues as to whether science is valued.<BR><BR>


<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>    Do you see displays related to science? Science learning
          	centers?

     	<LI>    Are science-related drawings on the bulletin boards? Are
          	there plants, terrariums, aquariums, or collections (of
          	rocks or insects, for  example)?

     	<LI>    Do you see any science equipment in evidence? Are there
          	magnifiers? Magnets?  Pictures? Films?

     	<LI>    Does the school library contain science books? If so, ask
          	the librarian if the children are encouraged to read them.

     	<LI>    Is there enough space in the classrooms or elsewhere in
          	the school for students to conduct experiments?

     	<LI>    In science classes, do students work with  materials, or is
          	the teacher always demonstrating? Do students discuss their
          	ideas, predictions, and explanations with each other as well
          	as with the teacher?<BR><BR>
</UL>

<LI>  Ask questions about the science program at parent-teacher
     conferences or PTA meetings. Or set up an appointment with the
     school principal. This provides you with information about the
     science program and lets educators know you think science is
     important. Educators are more apt to teach subjects they know
     parents are interested in. Here are some things to find out:<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>    What facilities and resources are available to teach science?
          	If the school budget for science is inadequate, has the
          	school or district tried to obtain resources from the
          community, particularly the business community?

     <LI>    How often is science taught? Every day, once a week, or
          only once in a while?

     <LI>    Do the school and/or your children's teachers have clear
          goals and objectives for teaching science?

     <LI>    Can students do hands-on science projects?

     <LI>    Are activities available that parents can use at home to
          supplement class instruction?<BR><BR>
</UL>
<LI>   Take action.<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
     <LI>    If the science program is inadequate, talk with your child's
          teacher or meet with the principal. If that brings no
          results, write to or meet with school board members. You
          might get better results if you organize with other parents
          who have similar concerns.

     <LI>    Volunteer your services to improve the science programs.
          You can:  <BR><BR>

<a name="Concepts"></a>
<B><I>Concepts</I></B><BR><BR>

<P>The National Center for Improving Science Education recommends that
elementary schools  design curricula that introduce nine scientific
concepts.  Many of the activities described in this handbook teach
these concepts, which are drawn from the center's recent report,
Getting Started in Science: A Blueprint for Elementary School Science
Education.  The nine concepts are:</P>

<P><B>1. Organization.</B>  Scientists have made the study of science manageable
by organizing and classifying natural phenomena.  For example, natural
objects can be assembled in hierarchies (atoms, molecules, mineral
grains, rocks, strata, hills, mountains, and planets).  Or objects can
be arranged according to their complexity (single-celled amoeba,
sponges, and so on to mammals).</P>

<P>Primary grade children can be introduced to this concept by sorting
objects like leaves, shells, or rocks according to their
characteristics.  Intermediate grade children can classify vegetables
or fruits according to properties they observe in them, and then
compare their own classification schemes to those used by scientists.</P>

<P><B>2. Cause and effect. </B> Nature behaves in predictable ways.  Searching
for explanations is the  major activity of science; effects cannot
occur without causes.  Primary children can learn about cause and
effect by observing the effect that light, water, and warmth have on
seeds and plants.  Intermediate grade children can discover that good
lubrication and streamlining the body of a pinewood derby car can make
it run faster.</P>

<P><B>3. Systems.</B> A system is a whole that is composed of parts arranged in
an orderly manner  according to some scheme or plan.  In science,
systems involve matter, energy, and information that move through
defined pathways.  The amount of matter, energy, and information, and
the rate at which they are transferred through the pathways, varies
over time.  Children begin to understand systems by tracking changes
among the individual parts.</P>

<P>Primary children can learn about systems by studying the notion of
balance--for example, by observing the movements and interactions in an
aquarium.  Older children might gain an understanding of systems by
studying the plumbing or heating systems in their homes.</P>

<P><B>4. Scale refers to quantity, both relative and absolute. </B>
Thermometers, rulers, and weighing devices help children see that
objects and energy vary in quantity.  It's hard for children to
understand that certain phenomena can exist only within fixed limits of
size.  Yet primary grade children can begin to understand scale if they
are asked, for instance, to imagine a mouse the size of an elephant.
Would the mouse still have the same proportions if it were that large?
What changes would have to occur in the elephant-sized mouse for it to
function?   Intermediate grade children can be asked to describe the
magnification of a microscope.</P>

<P><B>5. Models.  </B>We can create or design objects that represent other
things.  This is a hard concept for very young children.  But primary
grade children can gain experience with it by drawing a picture of a
cell as they observe it through a microscope.  Intermediate grade
children can use a model of the earth's crust to demonstrate the cause
of earthquakes.</P>

<P><B>6. Change. </B> The natural world continually changes, although some
changes may be too slow to observe.  Rates of change vary.  Children
can be asked to observe changes in the position and apparent shape of
the moon.  Parents and children can track the position of the moon at
the same time each night and draw pictures of the moon's changing shape
to learn that change takes place during the lunar cycle.  Children can
also observe and describe changes in the properties of water when it
boils, melts, evaporates, freezes, or condenses.</P>

<P><B>7. Structure and function.</B> A relationship exists between the way
organisms and objects look (feel, smell, sound, and taste) and the
things they do.  Children can learn that skunks let off a bad odor to
protect themselves.  Children also can learn to infer what a mammal
eats by studying its teeth, or what a bird eats by studying the
structure of its beak.</P>

<P><B>8. Variation.</B>  To understand the concept of organic evolution and the
statistical nature of the world, students first need to understand that
all organisms and objects have distinctive properties.  Some of these
properties are so distinctive that no continuum connects them--for
example, living and nonliving things, or sugar and salt.  In most of
the natural world, however, the properties of organisms and objects
vary continuously.</P>

<P>Young children can learn about this concept by observing and arranging
color tones. Older children can investigate the properties of a
butterfly during its life cycle to discover qualities that stay the
same as well as those that change.</P>

<P><B>9. Diversity.</B>  This is the most obvious characteristic of the natural
world.  Even preschoolers know that there are many types of objects and
organisms.  In elementary school, youngsters need to begin
understanding that diversity in nature is essential for natural systems
to survive.  Children can explore and investigate a pond, for instance,
to learn that different organisms feed on different things.</P>

<td valign=top>

<p>Teaching elementary science is not easy, especially in a small school.
Elementary teachers in general and rural elementary teachers in particular
are asked to teach science when typically they have not been adequately
prepared in at least three critical areas: fundamental science knowledge;
meaningful preparation in actually teaching science; and instruction as to
buying and using pertinent course materials. Further problems for elementary
science teachers in small schools occur with respect to inadequate amounts of
 time, lack of money and library reference materials, too narrow science
curriculum guides, and limited district support for facilities and personnel.
While tackling all of these problems is beyond the scope of this digest,
 suggestions for improving science teaching and ways for small schools to
upgrade their programs are provided. </p>

<hr>

<a name="how"></a>
<h3>How And Where Can One Secure Science Materials From Free And Inexpensive
Resources?</h3>

<p>One way for K-6 teachers in small schools to overcome some of the
difficulties in teaching elementary science is to involve children and
parents in obtaining free and inexpensive science-related materials.
Materials should be collected during the entire year, and can be secured from
visits to city institutions (museums, libraries); federal, state, and county
offices like the U.S. Forest service and the Soil Conservation Service; and
from vacations to national and state parks. Materials can also be obtained
from colleges and universities and public interest groups like the Audubon
Society, National Wildlife Federation, and regional plant societies. It
should be recognized, however, that special interest groups usually have
particular points of  view and that materials should represent a balance of
outlooks. Several inexpensive children's magazines are especially useful in
teaching elementary science: Ranger Rick, Zoobooks, And 3-2-1 Contact.
Magazine donations from school families can be solicited and can include an
array of titles, including National Geographic, Discover, Science 86,
Scientific American, Audubon, and National Wildlife. Moreover, three adult
publications are specifically geared to teaching elementary science on a
shoestring: Science And Children (each issue has a list of free and
inexpensive science materials); Tops, and Educator's Guide To Free Science
Materials. Freebies magazine is more general, but does provide sources for
science materials.</p>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="materials"></a>
<h3>How Can The Materials Be Easily Organized?</h3>

<p>Free and inexpensive materials need to be arranged in a logical manner in
order to be effective and useful. One such arrangement consists of six major
categories: Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, Astronomy, Physics, and
Research Processes. While there will be divisions and subdivisions for 
all categories, the large number of materials related to biology result in
many divisions for this subject. Three possible biological divisions include
animals, humans, and plants. These can be further divided; for example,
animals can be subdivided into birds, mammals,
and reptiles.</p>

<p>Legal-size manila file folders can be used to hold the free and
inexpensive printed materials gathered for each division with new folders
added as new divisions and subdivisions are created. Similarly, nonprint
materials should be systematically referenced in file folders and placed in
boxes.  The cataloging and systematizing processes themselves can provide a
scientific framework for the students who, of  necessity, should play a major
role in sorting, arranging, and filing.</p>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="modules"></a>
<h3>How Can Teaching Modules Be Developed?</h3>

<p>Manila folders containing free and inexpensive science materials form the
information base for converting raw data into meaningful and useful teaching
guides and modules. In order for the 
folders to become a module, these components need to be completed for each
folder. </p>
<UL>
<li>The accumulated materials should be listed, including the nonprint
materials filed elsewhere. <br><br> 
<li>The way each module integrates with all other modules (e.g., birds with
insects) and with other school subjects (e.g., flowers with art) should be
specified. <br><br> 
<li>Equipment necessary to more fully study the module (e.g., a microscope)
should be listed, along with information on locating equipment.<br><br>
 <li>There should be a list of local places to visit, local resource people
to contact, and famous personalities associated with the module (e.g., Marie
Curie and the atomic energy module). <br><br>
<li>Related reference books should be listed with page numbers cited and
physical location noted (e.g., the library).<br><br> 
<li>A set of lesson plans and activities of ever-increasing difficulty should
be included for each module. <br><br>
<li>A variety of tests should be included.<br><br>
</UL>
<hr>

<p>Such an ambitious project should not be viewed as something to accomplish
in a single year. It might even be coordinated across different grade levels.
No module should ever be considered complete; new materials and ideas can be
constantly added and unworkable ones phased out gradually or altogether
deleted.</p>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="used"></a>
<h3>How Are The Modules Used To Teach Science?</h3>

<p>The actual construction of the modules is a teaching and learning
experience for teachers and students alike. Modules can be initiated and used
immediately from the first free or inexpensive item received and, if
successful, can only prove more rewarding with time. As more students and
teachers become involved, the more complete the modules will become. Lesson
plans begin to accumulate, posters increase in number, and integration with
other subjects becomes more apparent. Invariably, this science program is 
user-friendly because it is constructed by the very individuals who will
implement it and who have a practical and theoretical interest in its
successes and failures.  As new teachers come into the district, they can
take up the construction at whatever phase they find it, without having to
initiate their own program from scratch.</p>

<p>If the school uses a science text, curriculum guide, or learning kit, it
can be supplemented by the  modules, permitting a more functional, eclectic,
and improved science program.  Students learn much more readily when they
become involved in developing their own lessons or when two approaches are
synthesized into one coherent program.</p>

<p>Since teachers are ultimately responsible for constructing the modules,
they must accept the responsibility for devising lessons that correlate with
various ability levels and learning styles of their students.</p>

<h3>Are There Other Ways To Improve K-6 Science In Small Schools?</h3>

<p>While module building and teaching science from free and inexpensive
materials is one way to explore elementary science in small schools, there
are several other ways to improve or upgrade existing programs:</p>
<UL>
<li>by videotaping television science programs<br><br>
<li>e.g., Owl/TV, 3-2-1 Contact, National Geographic specials<br><br>
<li>and complying with all copyright regulations;<br><br> 
<li>by requesting universities to offer science methods courses specifically
for small-school teachers;<br><br> 
<li>by contacting interactive computer networks that specialize in science
teaching (in New Mexico, for example, one source is Mr. Jack Gittinger,
Co-director, CISCO-Net Project, Department of Science Education, College of
Education, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131);<br><br> 
<li>by using the ERIC system to find materials on telecommunication satellite
systems that would transmit science news, programs, and career information to

<h3>What Are The Overall Contributions Of Teacher/Student-Made Modules?</h3>

<p>Teaching K-6 science in small schools through teacher/student-made modules
from free and inexpensive materials is not a cure-all for the difficulties of
teaching science in small schools. Rather, it is a means of providing
teachers in small schools with a direct and accessible way to improve their
science teaching and to build enthusiasm among students for the many aspects
of science.</p>

<P>Howard's teachers say he just isn't working up to
his ability.   He doesn't finish his assignments, or just
puts down answers without  showing his work; his
handwriting and spelling are poor.  He sits and  fidgets in
class, talks to others, and often disrupts class by
interrupting others.  He used to shout out the answers to
the  teachers' questions (they were usually right), but
now he day-dreams a  lot and seems distracted.  Does Howard
have Attention Deficit  Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),
is he gifted, or both?   </P>
<P>     Frequently, bright children have been referred to
psychologists  or pediatricians because they exhibited
certain behaviors (e.g.,  restlessness, inattention,
impulsivity, high activity level,  day-dreaming)
commonly associated with a diagnosis of ADHD.  Formally,
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-III-R)  (American Psychiatric
Association) lists 14 characteristics that may  be found
in children diagnosed as having ADHD.  At least 8 of these
characteristics must be present, the onset must be
before age 7, and  they must be present for at least six
months. </P>

<a name="Diagnostic"></a>
<H3>DSM-III-R Diagnostic Criteria For Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder*</H3>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">

	<LI>  Often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat (in
	adolescents may be limited to subjective feelings of
	restlessness).
	<LI>  Has difficulty remaining seated when required to.
	<LI>  Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli.
	<LI>  Has difficulty awaiting turns in games or group situations.
<LI>  Often blurts out answers to questions before they have
been  completed.
<LI>  Has difficulty following through on instructions
from others   (not due to oppositional behavior or failure
of comprehension).
<LI>  Has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play
activities.
<LI>  Often shifts from one uncompleted activity to
another.
<LI> Has difficulty playing quietly.
<LI> Often talks excessively.
<LI> Often interrupts or intrudes on others, e.g., butts
into other  people's games.
<LI>Often does not seem to listen to what is being said to
him or  her.
<LI>  Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities
at school  or at home (e.g., toys, pencils, books).
<LI>  Often engages in physically dangerous activities
without  considering possible consequences (not for the
purpose of  thrill-seeking), e.g., runs into street
without looking.
</OL>

<P>     Almost all of these behaviors, however, might be found in
bright,  talented, creative, gifted children.  Until
now, little attention has  been given to the similarities
and differences between the two groups,  thus raising the
potential for misidentification in both
areas-giftedness and ADHD.    </P>
<P>     Sometimes, professionals have diagnosed ADHD by simply
listening  to parent or teacher descriptions of the
child's behaviors along with  a brief observation of the
child.  Other times, brief screening  questionnaires are
used, although these questionnaires only quantify  the
parents' or teachers' descriptions of the behaviors
(Parker,  1992).  Children who are fortunate enough to
have a thorough physical  evaluation (which includes
screening for allergies and other metabolic  disorders)
and extensive psychological evaluations, which
include  assessment of intelligence, achievement, and
emotional status, have a  better chance of being
accurately identified.  A child may be gifted  and have
ADHD.  Without a thorough professional evaluation, it is
difficult to tell.  </P>

<a name="Situation"></a>
<H3>Consider the Situation and Setting</H3>
<P>     It is important to examine the situations in which a
child's  behaviors are problematic.  Gifted children
typically do not exhibit  problems in all situations.  For
example, they may be seen as  ADHD-like by one classroom
teacher, but not by another; or they may be  seen as ADHD at
school, but not by the scout leader or music teacher.
Close examination of the troublesome situation
generally reveals other  factors which are prompting the
problem behaviors.  By contrast,  children with ADHD
typically exhibit the problem behaviors in  virtually
all settings-including at home and at school-though the
extent of their problem behaviors may fluctuate
significantly from   setting to setting (Barkley, 1990),
depending largely on the structure  of that situation.
That is, the behaviors exist in all settings, but  are more
of a problem in some settings than in others. </P>
<P>     In the classroom, a gifted child's perceived inability
to stay on  task is likely to be related to boredom,
curriculum, mismatched  learning style, or other
environmental factors.  Gifted children may  spend from
one-fourth to one-half of their regular classroom time
waiting for others to catch up-even more if they are in a
heterogeneously grouped class.  Their specific level of
academic  achievement is often two to four grade levels
above their actual grade  placement.  Such children often
respond to non-challenging or  slow-moving classroom
situations by "off-task" behavior, disruptions,  or
other attempts at self-amusement.  This use of extra time
is often  the cause of the referral for an ADHD evaluation. </P>
<P>     Hyperactive is a word often used to describe gifted
children as  well as children with ADHD.  As with attention
span, children with  ADHD have a high activity level, but
this activity level is often  found across situations
(Barkley, 1990).  A large proportion of gifted  children
are highly active too.  As many as one-fourth may require
less sleep; however, their activity is generally
focused and directed  (Clark, 1992; Webb, Meckstroth, &amp;
Tolan, 1982), in contrast to the  behavior of children
with ADHD.  The intensity of gifted children's
concentration often permits them to spend long periods
of time and  much energy focusing on whatever truly
interests them.  Their specific  interests may not
coincide, however, with the desires and expectations  of
teachers or parents. </P>
<P>     While the child who is hyperactive has a very brief
attention  span in virtually every situation (usually
except for television or  computer games), children who
are gifted can concentrate comfortably  for long periods
on tasks that interest them, and do not require  immediate
completion of those tasks or immediate consequences.
The  activities of children with ADHD tend to be both
continual and random;  the gifted child's activity
usually is episodic and directed to  specific goals. </P>
<P>     While difficulties and adherence to rules and
regulations has  only begun to be accepted as a sign of ADHD
(Barkley, 1990), gifted  children may actively question
rules, customs and traditions,  sometimes creating
complex rules which they expect others to respect  or
obey. Some engage in power struggles. These behaviors
can cause  discomfort for parents, teachers, and peers. </P>
<P>     One characteristic of ADHD that does not have a
counterpart in  children who are gifted is variability of
task performance.  In almost  every setting, children
with ADHD tend to be highly inconsistent in  the quality of
their performance (i.e., grades, chores) and the amount
of time used to accomplish tasks (Barkley, 1990).
Children who are  gifted routinely maintain consistent
efforts and high grades in  classes when they like the
teacher and are intellectually challenged,  although
they may resist some aspects of the work, particularly
repetition of tasks perceived as dull.  Some gifted
children may  become intensely focused and determined
(an aspect of their  intensity) to produce a product that
meets their self-imposed  standards. </P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Teachers"></a>
<H3>What Teachers and Parents Can Do</H3>
<P>     Determining whether a child has ADHD can be particularly
difficult when that child is also gifted.  The use of many
instruments, including intelligence tests
administered by qualified  professionals, achievement
and personality tests, as well as parent  and teacher
rating scales, can help the professional determine the
subtle differences between ADHD and giftedness.
Individual evaluation  allows the professional to
establish maximum rapport with the child to  get the best
effort on the tests.  Since the test situation is
constant, it is possible to make better comparisons
among children.   Portions of the intellectual and
achievement tests will reveal  attention problems or
learning disabilities, whereas personality tests  are
designed to show whether emotional problems (e.g.,
depression or  anxiety) could be causing the problem
behaviors.  Evaluation should be  followed by
appropriate curricular and instructional
modifications  that account for advanced knowledge,
diverse learning styles, and  various types of
intelligence. </P>
<P>     Careful consideration and appropriate professional
evaluation are  necessary before concluding that
bright, creative, intense youngsters  like Howard have
ADHD.  Consider the characteristics of the
gifted/talented child and the child's situation.  Do not
hesitate to  raise the possibility of giftedness with any
professional who is  evaluating the child for ADHD;
however, do not be surprised if the  professional has had
little training in recognizing the  characteristics of
gifted/talented children (Webb, 1993).  It is  important
to make the correct diagnosis, and parents and teachers
may  need to provide information to others since
giftedness is often  neglected in professional
development programs. </P>

advice to reduce the risk of suffocation and Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome (SIDS).  To prevent suffocation, never put babies to
sleep on adult beds.</P>

<P>Make sure your baby's crib is sturdy and has no loose or missing
hardware.  This will prevent babies suffocating or strangling by
becoming trapped between broken crib parts.</P>

<P>Never place your baby's crib or furniture near window blind or
curtain cords.  This will prevent babies from strangling on the
loop of the cord.  To prevent falls, keep children away from
windows.</P>

<H4>In the bathroom:</H4>

<P>Keep medicines and cleaning products in containers with safety
caps and locked away from children.  This will prevent children
from being poisoned.</P>

<P>Always check bath water temperature with your wrist or elbow
before putting your baby in to bathe.  This will prevent burns to
a baby's delicate skin.</P>

<P>Never, ever, leave your child alone in the bathtub or near any
water.  This will prevent children from drowning.  In addition,
keep children away from all standing water, including water in
toilets, 5-gallon buckets, and pools.</P>

<H4>In the kitchen:</H4>

<P>Don't leave your baby alone in a highchair; always use all safety
straps.  This will prevent injuries and deaths from the baby
climbing out, falling, or sliding under the tray.  Be sure to use
safety straps in strollers and baby swings.</P>

<P>Use your stove's back burners and keep pot handles turned to the
back of the stove.  This will prevent deaths and injuries from
burns.  In addition, keep children away from tablecloths, so they
can't pull down hot foods or liquids on themselves.</P>

<P>Lock household cleaning products, knives, matches, and plastic
bags away from children.  This will prevent poisonings, bleeding
injuries, burns, and suffocation.</P>

<H4>In other living areas:</H4>

<P>Install smoke detectors on each floor of your home, especially
near sleeping areas; change the batteries each year.  This will
prevent deaths and injuries from fires. </P>

<P>Use safety gates to block stairways and safety plugs to cover
electrical outlets.  This will  prevent injuries from falls and
electric shocks.</P>

<P>Keep all small objects, including tiny toys and balloons, away
from young children.  This will prevent choking and possible
death.</P>

<P>Washington, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Bucky Products Inc., of
Seattle, Wash., is recalling over 3,800 Baby Bucky baby
pillows. Infant pillows and cushions have been banned under
the Federal Hazardous Substances Act because they pose a
potential suffocation hazard to infants.</P>
<P>     The C-shaped infant pillows are intended for use in
infant car seats and strollers to keep children's heads from
rolling from side to side as they sleep. The pillows,
measuring 10 inches long by 9.5 inches wide, weigh about 10
ounces, are covered in French blue, pink, or emerald jade
Polartec fabric, and are filled with buckwheat hulls. The
pillows' hang tags read in part, "baby BUCKY ... Seattle
U.S.A. ... Pillows." Travel, variety, drug, and department
retail stores sold the pillows nationwide from December 1993
to June 1995 for $22 each.</P>
<P>     Consumers should take the pillows away from children
immediately and return the pillows to the store where
purchased for a full refund. Consumers can also send their
Baby Bucky pillows to P.O. Box 31970, Seattle, Wash. 98103
for a full refund plus mailing costs.  For more information,
consumers should call Bucky Products Inc. at (800) 692-8259.</P>

<P>     Bucky Products Inc. and CPSC are not aware of any
injuries involving these pillows.  This recall does not include
 the larger Adult Bucky Travel Pillows. </P>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer        Product
Safety Commission (CPSC), Playskool Baby, Inc. of  Northvale, N.J., is
voluntarily recalling approximately 38,000 "Fold N' Travel" infant carriers
because infants may fall out of the carrier. </p>
<p>Playskool has received 10 reports of children falling from the carrier,
including reports of seven infants who suffered serious head injuries. </p> 
<p>The lightweight plastic infant carriers, measuring about 17 inches long
when folded and about 26 inches long when fully extended, were available in
blue or teal with either a fabric or vinyl pad (model numbers 100, 101,102,
103). Consumers adjust the carrier to any of three positions, rocker,
feeder, or sleeper, by pushing the buttons located on each side of the
carrier's handle near where the handle attaches to the carrier.  The product
can be folded by squeezing levers located underneath the carrier.</p>
<p>Children's products retailers sold the Fold N' Travel carriers
nationwide from April 1991 through 1993 for approximately $35.00. </p>
<p>Consumers who own Fold N' Travel infant carriers should stop using them
immediately and return the carriers to Playskool or to the store where
purchased, for a full refund. To receive pre-paid shipping materials and for
information on returning the carriers, consumers should call Playskool at
(800) 447-7707. </p>
<p>Playskool stopped manufacturing Fold N' Travel infant carriers  in April
1993. </p>
<p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the     public from
unreasonable risks of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer products
under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's fax-on-demand service,

<P> ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS A CHILD CAN DO IS PLAY<BR>
                                        </P>
</center>
<hr>
<h2> <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<P>     One of the most important things a child do is play.
Play is the essential joy of childhood and is also the way
children learn about themselves, their environment and the
people around them.  As they play, children learn to solve
problems, get along with other people and control their
bodies as they enrich their creativity and develop leadership
skills.  When children play with a broad variety of toys, the
experiences help them to develop to their fullest potential.</P>

<P>     Children bring boundless energy and imagination to their
play with toys and constantly developing new and creative
ways to play.  Because there are so many different kinds of
toys and novel way to play with them, children learn that the
world is a diverse place with unlimited possibilities.  Toys
thus have an exciting role in helping children to become
mature, confident and imaginative adults.</P>

<P>     This booklet has been designed to help you provide the
best play opportunities for your child, describes how the toy
industry and government work together to ensure toy safety
and offers simple charts to guide you as you do your toy
shopping.  Have fun!                                        </P>

<hr>
<h2> <a name="Learning through Play">Learning through Play</a></h2>


<P>     Play is essential to a child's development and is the
way that youngsters learn the skills they will need for a
happy and capable adulthood.  According to child development
specialist, Mary Sinker, these are just some of the ways a
child learns while playing.</P>

<P>     Physical skills are developed through movement as a
child learns to reach, grasp, crawl, run, climb and balance.
Dexterity develops as he or she handles objects in play.</P>

<P>     Language develops as a child plays and interacts with
others.  Beginning with cooing games with a parent and
evolving to sophisticated levels such as telling stories and
jokes, the ability to use language increases as the child
plays.
     Social skills grow as the child plays.  Learning to
cooperate, negotiate, take turns and play by the rules are
all important skills learned in early games.  It is through
imaginative play that the child begins to learn some of the
roles and rules of society.</P>

<P>     Understanding how the world works develops as a result
of problem solving with toys.  What fits here?  How big is
that?  Is this color the same as that color?  How can I
balance these?  A child moves on to higher levels of thought
as he or she plays in a stimulating environment.</P>

<P>     Emotional well being develops through positive play
experiences.  When children feel successful and capable as
they play, they acquire important ingredients for emotional
health.  Sharing play experiences also forges strong bonds
between parent and child throughout childhood.              3</P>
<hr>
<h2> <a name="Parental Involvement in Play">Parental Involvement in
Play</a></h2>


<P>     Parents are their child's first and best playmates.  Not
only do parents have an important role in choosing good toys,
but research shows that the most creative children are those
who have had adults involved in their play.  The richest play
occurs when the adult takes an active role and plays
alongside the child, rather than just providing the toys or
supervising the activity.</P>

<P>     Becoming part of a child's play may take practice; after
all, we have been taught to give up childish things and "grow
up."  Here are some suggestions for joining your child's
play:</P>

<P>     <B>OBSERVE:</B>  Watch your child closely to determine his or
her skill levels and favorite activities.</P>
    <P> <B>FOLLOW:</B>  join in and play at the child's level.  You
can add to the complexity of the play, but let your child be
in control and determine the direction of the play.</P>
   <P>  <B>BE CREATIVE:</B>  Rediscover the child inside yourself and
let go of the adult notion that there is only one way to play
with a toy.  Use toys as "springboards" and you'll be amazed
at how many different ways you can play.</P>
     <P><B>HAVE FUN:</B>  The wonderful thing about playing is that
everyone is successful at it.  Don't use playtime to test or
stretch your child's skills.  It's a time to feel good about
yourself and each other--and to just have fun together.</P>

<hr>
<h2> <a name="Safety">Safety</a></h2>

<B>How the Federal Government and Industry Cooperate to Regulate
Toy Safety</B>

<P>     Toys have the distinction of being one of the most
closely monitored and regulated products on the market.  This
is understandable, given that over 2.6 billion toys are
purchased each year and parents are naturally very
       (Graphic omitted between pp 4 and 5)
concerned about the products they give their children.</P>
<P>     The toy industry and the Federal government work closely
together to ensure that toys are among the safest products
brought into the home.  The United States Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC), created in 1973 and headquartered
in Bethesda, Maryland, has the authority to develop and
enforce safety regulations for toys and other children's
products.  The Commission employs teams of field inspectors
to monitor the marketplace for both domestically- and
foreign-produced toys that could pose safety hazards.</P>
<P>     The CPSC's regulations are incorporated by reference in
the industry's voluntary safety standard, ASTM F963, and are
a chief example of Toy Manufacturers of America's
coordination and cooperation with the CPSC.  TMA also works
regularly with the Commission to develop safety testing
procedures and to monitor any potential hazards associated
with toys already in the market.</P>
<P>     The American voluntary manufacturers' standards are
known as the most comprehensive in the world and any safety
requirements established by the CPSC are included in ASTM
F963.  (Many companies will note their compliance with the
standard on toy packaging.)  A toy may go through over one
hundred safety tests designated to duplicate the kind of use
and abuse it may get in the hands of a child.</P>
<P>     One of the most important safety tests a manufacturer
conducts is for small parts.  Since children under the age of
three are very likely to put objects in their mouths, it is
especially critical that toys intended for infants and
toddlers be manufactured with oversized pieces which meet
U.S. safety specifications.                                 </P>
<P>     A recent CPSC study of hospital emergency room data
suggests that the most frequent causes of injury involving
toys are falling on, tripping over or being hit with toys.
(In fact, toy-related and toy-caused accidents, which sound
so similar, are actually very different.  "Toy-related"
accidents happen for any number of reasons but are not due to
product flaws--e.g., tripping in the dark over a toy that was
not put away after play.  "Toy-caused" accidents, which occur
due to a fault in the toy's design, material content,
construction or performance, are infrequent.)</P>
<P>     The work that the toy industry does to design and
produce safe toys, as well as to communicate the importance
of proper adult supervision, continues to pay off by making
toys one of the safest consumer products available.</P>

<B>Supervision is Essential</B>

<P>     Careful manufacturing methods and toy selection are not
enough, however.  Toys must be used, maintained and stored
correctly to ensure that the safety built in at the factory
continues in the home.  There is no substitute, ever, for
sensible adult supervision!</P>
<P>     Parents and others responsible for a child's care must
be safety experts.  Remember, too, that youngsters learn safe
play habits and responsibility from grownups.  Read
instructions carefully to make sure that both you and child
understand them.  Special attention to directions will result
in safer play and longer toy life.
     Always remove and immediately discard all packaging
                  (Graphic omitted)
from a toy before giving it to a baby or small child.</P>

<B>A Few Words About Baby Safety</B>

<P>     An infant's environment should be made as hazard-free as
possible.  Crib gyms and mobiles must be removed once the
infant reaches five months of age or begins to push up on
hands and knees.  Remember that crib toys such as stuffed
animals, rattle and beads should never be hung or attached to
a crib, playpen or carriage with any sort of string or
ribbon.  (No matter how harmless you may think this is, there
is the possibility of the cord getting attached to a button
or strap of clothing or wrapped around hands, feet or neck.)</P>
<P>     For additional ideas on the selection and care of baby's
crib, stroller, car seat and other non-toy essentials, write
to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association for their
free brochure, "Safe and Sound for Baby."  Send a self-
addressed, stamped envelope (U.S. postage only) to JPMA, Two
Greentree Centre, Suite 225, P.O Box 955, Marlton, NJ 08053.</P>

<B>Toy Maintenance</B>

<P>     The proper selection of toys and supervision of play are
not the only steps that parents can take to ensure safe and
fun playtime.  Since toys are among the first things a child
considers his or her own, adults should encourage a youngster
to assume responsibility by demonstrating how to use and care
for toys.</P>
<P>     Spot check toys regularly for minor damage and urge
children to let you know when toys need repair.  A child does
not always see significance in a small crack or tear if the
toy is still in once piece.  Often a spot of glue, a
tightened bolt, a few drops of oil or a bit of tape will
prevent further damage and a possible accident.</P>
<P>     Do not allow toys to remain outdoors overnight.  Rain,
snow and dew cause rust and damage that increase the risk of
accidents.  A toy damaged beyond repair should be discarded
or replaced promptly.</P>
<P>     Teach children to store their toys properly in a place
selected by you.  Explain that putting toys where they
belong after play may not only prevent them from being lost,
stolen or damaged, but may also prevent younger brothers and
sisters from injuring themselves on toys intended for older
children.  Your encouragement will help to foster a sense of
responsibility and teach that care must be given to valued
belongings.</P>

<B>A Note About Balloons</B>

<P>     Because of the special attraction they hold for
children, balloons pose a risk that many parents overlook.
Since an uninflated balloon or a piece of a broken balloon
could present a choking or suffocation hazard, adults should
inflate balloons and supervise their use with children under
the age of eight.</P>

<hr>
<h2> <a name="Safety Checklist">Safety Checklist</a></h2>

<P>Remember that safety is the most important consideration
when selecting toys!  Keep this checklist of safety
suggestions handy when shopping and share it with your
child's caregivers.</P>

<P>Use recommended age labeling as a guide and look for
warnings and other safety messages on toy packaging.  This
will be covered in more detail in the next section.</P>

<P>Consider your home environment and the ages of other,
particularly younger, children in the family.  A toy intended
for an older child may be unsuitable and possibly dangerous
in the hands of a younger child.</P>

<P>Be especially careful when selecting toys for children under
the age of three.  Avoid toys with small parts that could be
swallowed or inhaled, including small balls and uninflated
balloons, and those with sharp points or rough edges.</P>

<P>Make sure that soft rattles, squeakers and teething toys,
even in their most compressed state, are too large to fit
completely in an infant's mouth.                            </P>

<P>     (Graphic omitted)</P>

<P>No matter how old a child is, if he or she is still mouthing
objects, be sure toys or pieces of toys are too large to
swallow or become lodged in the mouth or throat.</P>

<P>Check for sturdy, well-sewn seams on stuffed animals and
cloth dolls.  Be certain that eyes, noses, buttons, ribbons
and other decorations are securely fastened and cannot be
pulled or bitten off.</P>

<P>Choose electric toys with heating elements only for children
over the age of eight and instruct them to play with those
toys only when there is adult supervision.</P>

<P>Be certain that arrows and darts used by children have blunt
tips such as rubber or flexible plastic suction cups, cork or
other protective points.  Check to see that tips are attached
securely to shafts.</P>

<P>Look for the words "machine/surface washable" on stuffed and
cloth toys and "UL (Underwriters Laboratories) Approved" on
electrical toys.</P>

<P>Purchase a toy storage chest that has a removable lid or a
spring-loaded support, allowing the lid to remain securely
open.  Check for smooth, finished edges, proper air holes and
hinge line clearances to prevent pinched fingers.           </P>

<hr>
<h2> <a name="About Toy Labels">About Toy Labels</a></h2>

<P>     Labels on toy packages make choosing safe, appropriate
toys much easier.  However, no package label can tell you
exactly which toys are right for your child and not all toys
are appropriate for every youngster.  On the other hand,
child development experts agree that children develop in a
sequence of stages and toymakers use this information to
indicate which types of toys are safe and appropriate for
children of various ages.  Product labels held consumers
distinguish among the vast number of toys on the market to
make the most appropriate purchases.</P>

<P>     Remember, each child is unique and develops at his or
her own pace.  The best thing adults can do when purchasing
toys is to know the maturity, skill level and interests of
the child, read the age labels carefully and use them as
guides and, above all, use common sense.  Nobody knows your
child better than you do.</P>

<B>How Toys Are Age Labeled</B>

<P>     Toymakers follow the age grading guidelines of the
Consumer Product Safety Commission, which consist of four
main criteria:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>the ability of a child to physically manipulate and play
	with the features of a toy
	<LI>the ability of a child to understand how to use a toy
	<LI>the child's play needs and interest at different
	developmental levels
	<LI>the safety aspects of the toy itself
</UL>

<P>     A child's abilities, interests and play needs will, of
course, vary at each level of development.
     New toys are frequently tested by children in play
     (Graphic omitted)
settings to determine durability, age-appropriatemenss and
play patterns.  At least one large toy manufacturer maintains
an in-house, year-round nursery school for this purpose,
while others establish relationships with universities and
other educational facilities.  Manufacturers also may involve
parents, teachers and others who care for children for their
first-hand knowledge and valuable insights.  In addition, a
toymaker may have a child development specialist,
psychologist or physician on staff or working as a
consultant.</P>

<B>Safety Labeling</B>

<P>     As of January 1, 1995, new toys and games for children
ages three through six will be required to carry warnings
about choking hazards.  The warnings will tell the consumer
if the toy contains small parts, a small ball, marbles, or
balloons; that these items are choking hazards, and that the
toy is not intended for children under the age of three.  No
matter what the age of the child, toys with these labels
should be avoided if the child is still mouthing objects.</P>

<P>     Some manufacturers may add other safety warnings and
cautions to the package and/or instructions advising parents
that special care should be taken.  Sometimes manufacturers
wish to emphasize that children may need help understanding
the instructions or that adult supervision may be required
during playtime.  Toys that would have cautionary labels in
addition to the age label include:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>electrically operated toys that also may have heating
	elements
	<LI>science toy sets that may contain toxic chemicals
	<LI>craft or science kits that may have functional sharp
	instruments such as scissors or breakable glass
	<LI>swim aids that are not life-saving devices
	<li>balloons
	<LI>kites
	<LI>crib gyms and mobiles, which should be removed when the baby
	 begins to push up on hands and knees to prevent possible
	entanglement
	<LI>any toy intended for assembly by an adult which may have
	potentially hazardous sharp points and edges in its pre-
	assembled state
</UL>

<B>How to Get the Most From Labels</B>

<P>     Now that you are familiar with the research involved in
designing a toy and assigning it an age label, you can make
your next toy purchase with confidence.  Keeping in mind your
child's skills and interests and using age labels as a guide,
you will be able to select a fun and appropriate toy.
(Graphic omitted)</P>

<P>     If you are tempted to buy your child a toy labeled for
an older child, please reconsider.  Remember that the age
label has been thoughtfully assigned based upon many factors,
including safety.  If you give a child a toy that is too
simple or too advanced, he or she may be frustrated and/or
exposed to a safety hazard.</P>

<P>     Remember: the purpose of toys is to have fun.</P>

<hr>
<h2> <a name="Toy Selection">Toy Selection</a></h2>

<P>     The following are some suggestions for suitable toys for
children of various ages.  They are offered as a guide to
help in your selection, but remember that all children are
different.  Study your child and get to know his or her
interests, abilities and limitations.  Not all children enjoy
the same kinds of play: one child will be interested in
building with blocks or doing puzzles; another may prefer
riding bikes or playing ball; your child may enjoy pretending
with a dollhouse or playing board games.  Try to match the
toy to your child and keep in mind that his or her interest
in a toy will often carry through more than one age group.
(Graphic omitted)</P>

<B>Babies: Birth to One Year</B>

<P>     Experts agree that even babies need an assortment of
toys.  Since infants respond to smell, taste, sound, touch
and sight, properly selected toys provide a small baby with
opportunities to learn about size, shape, sound, texture and
how things work.</P>
<P>     Choose toys that:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>have pieces that are too large to swallow
	<LI>are lightweight for handling and grasping
	<LI>have no sharp edges or points
	<LI>are brightly colored
	<LI>are non-toxic
</UL>

<P>     Brightly colored, lightweight toys of various textures
stimulate a baby's senses.  For young infants, toys to look
at and listen to are best.  Rattles, squeaky toys and crib
gyms are ideal for grasping when the baby is ready to hold
objects.</P>

<P>     Soft dolls or stuffed animals made of non-toxic
materials are fun to touch and hug but are not designed for
sucking and chewing.  Make sure the seams cannot be easily
torn or bitten open and that eyes and noses are securely
fastened.  (Graphic omitted)</P>

<P>     A baby who is sitting up is ready for blocks with
pictures or bright colors.  Nesting cups or boxes and
stacking rings are also favorites.  Babies at this age
enjoy their first sturdy picture books showing familiar
objects.  Balls and push-pull toys are good choices when a
baby can crawl and walk.</P>

     (Graphic omitted)<BR><BR>

<B>Toddlers: One to Three Years</B>

<P>     A busy toddler needs toys for active physical play--
especially things to ride and climb on, such as a low
tricycle or a wagon to ride in and pull.  Outdoor toys such
as large balls, inflatable toys, a wading pool and an sandbox
with digging tools are all good choices.</P>

<P>     Toddlers begin to enjoy make-believe play just before
their second birthdays.  To imitate the adult world around
them, they use play food, appliances and utensils, child-
sized play furniture, simple dress-up clothes and dolls.
Children in this age group are particularly interested in
sorting and fitting toys, all kinds of blocks and simple
puzzles.  Toddlers also enjoy musical instruments such as
tambourines, toy pianos, horns and drums, as well as
listening to tapes.</P>

<B>Pre-Schoolers: Three to Five Years</B>

<P>     Pre-schoolers are masters of make-believe.  They like to
act out grown-up roles and create imaginary situations.
Costumes and equipment that help them in their pretend worlds
are important at this stage.  Some of the many possibilities
include pretend money, play food, a toy cash register or
telephone, a make-believe village, fort, circus, farm, gas
station or restaurant, a puppet theater and play with dolls
and doll furniture.</P>

<P>     In a child's private world, a favorite toy is both a
companion and protector.  Dolls and teddy bears, for example,
have helped countless children to cope with difficult
moments.  Children will sometimes express their feelings to
toy "confidants" and share emotions with them that
they might otherwise keep to themselves.</P>

<P>     Transportation is fascinating to young children.
Trucks, cars, planes, trains, boats and tractors are all fun
at this age and beyond.  Larger outdoor toys, including gym
equipment, wheeled vehicles and a first two-wheeled bicycle
with helmet and training wheels, are appropriate now.</P>

<P>     Visualization and memory skills can be sharpened by play
that requires use of imagination or mental computation, with
the introduction of board games, electronic toys and word and
matching games geared specifically for this group.
Construction sets, books and tapes, coloring sets, pains,
crayons, puzzles, stuffed toys and dolls continue to be
favorites.</P>

<B>School Age: Six to Nine Years</B>

<P>     Board games, table-top sports games and classics like
marbles and model or craft kits help develop skills for
social and solitary play.  In experimenting with different
kinds of grownup worlds, fashion and career dolls and all
kinds of action figures appeal to girls and boys.  Printing
sets, science and craft kits, electric trains, racing cars,
construction sets and hobby equipment are important to
children for examining and experimenting with the world
around them.</P>

<P>     For active physical play, a larger bicycle, ice and
roller skates, a pogo stick, scooter, sled and other sports
equipment, along with protective gear, are appropriate.  Even
though group play is enjoyed, children at this stage also
play well by themselves.  Paints, crayons and clay are still
good selections, as are costumes, doll houses, play villages,
miniature figures and vehicles, all of which help children to
develop their imaginations and creativity.</P>

<P>     Many games and electronic toys geared to children in
this age group are labeled "educational" because they have
been designed to help children learn specific skills and
concepts, such as games which require forming words, matching
letters of the alphabet with various objects or
learning about money through handling play coins and
currency.</P>

<P>     Video games appeal to children, teenages and adults.
Many games offer increasingly challenging levels of play, as
well as opportunities to develop coordination skills and a
sense of the meaning of strategies in relationships, usually
through competition against an opponent.</P>

<P>THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE, EVER, FOR SENSIBLE ADULT SUPERVISION<BR>
                                           (Graphic Omitted)</P>
<B>Nine to Twelve Years
</B>
<P>     Children begin to develop specific skills and life-long
interests at this age.  Give considerable attention to
hobbies and crafts, model kits, magic sets, advanced
construction sets, chemistry and science kits and puzzles.
Peer acceptance is very important at this age.  Active
physical play now finds its expression with team play in a
variety of sports.  Social and intellectual skills are
refined through board, card and electronic games,
particularly those requiring strategy decisions.</P>

<P>     Video and electronic games, table tennis and billiards
(pool) are very popular at this stage.  Dramatic play holds
great appeal.  Youngsters in this age group like to plan
complete productions including props, costumes, printed
programs, puppets and marionettes.  Painting, sculpting,
ceramics and other forms of artistic expression continue to
be of interest, as do books, tapes and musical instruments.</P>

<B>Teenagers</B>

<P>     After age twelve, children's interests in toys begin to
merge with those of adults.  This is apparent in the growing
market for sophisticated electronic games and computer-based
systems, which are often considered "family entertainment"
rather than toys.  They also will be interested in board
and adventure games.  Collectors of dolls, model cars,
trains, miniatures and stuffed animals often begin their
hobbies in the teenage years.                              </P>

<h2> <a name="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

<P>You've now completed the first step in mastering the basics
of toy selection and play.  Take the information and
suggestions in this booklet and put them to good use.</P>
<P>     Choose toys with care.  Get involved and encourage your
youngster to be creative through play.  Children tend to
remember lessons they learn while having fun, so set good
examples for proper use and maintenance of toys.  Remember,
youngsters who are creative at play tend to be more creative,
well adjusted and secure as adults.</P>

<P>Thank you for requesting the second edition of THE TMA GUIDE
TO TOYS and PLAY.  The seeds for this booklet were sown in late
1979 with the publication of a series of pamphlets covering
toy selection and play, followed by THE ABCs OF TOYS and PLAY
in 1983, LEARNING ABOUT LABELS in 1985 and the first version
of THE TMA GUIDE TO TOYS and PLAY in 1990.  Although the
principles of choosing safe toys and the importance of
playing with and supervising children are unchanged, our new
guide reflects the most up-to-date information available on
toy safety and child development.
     Toy Manufacturers of America, Inc. (TMA), founded in
1916 and based in New York City, is the trade association for
U.S. producers and importers of toys and holiday decorations.

International Toy Fair, working with government agencies on a
large variety of industry issues, engaging in an ongoing
safety assurance program, sponsoring and maintaining the Toy
Industry Hall of Fame, providing counsel to members,
compiling industry statistics, conducting a full
communications and public information program, producing a
series of educational seminars, supporting the Fashion
Institute of Technology's Toy Design Program and operating a
credit information exchange.
     The Association is recognized by government, the trade,
media and consumers as the authoritative voice of the U.S.
toy industry.
     If you have a problem with a toy, we encourage you to
contact the manufacturer or return it to the store where it
was purchased.</P>

<P>     An unsafe used crib could be very dangerous for your baby!
Each year, about 50 babies suffocate or strangle when they become
trapped between broken crib parts or in cribs with older, unsafe
designs. </P>

<P>     A safe crib is the best place to put your baby to sleep.
Look for a crib with a certification seal showing that it meets
national safety standards. </P>

<P>     If your crib does not meet these guidelines, destroy it and
replace it with a safe crib. </P>

<P>     A safe crib has: </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>No missing, loose, broken, or improperly-installed screws,
	brackets, or other hardware on the crib or the mattress support. 

<br><br><LI>No more than 2 3/8 inches between crib slats so a baby's
body cannot fit through the slats. 

<br><br><LI>A firm, snug-fitting mattress so a baby cannot get trapped
between the mattress and the side of the crib. 

<br><br><LI>No corner posts over 1/16 of an inch above the end panels
(unless they are over 16 inches high for a canopy) so a baby
cannot catch clothing and strangle. 

<br><br><LI>No cutout areas on the headboard or foot board so a baby's
head cannot get trapped. 

<br><br><LI>A mattress support that does not easily pull apart from the
corner posts so a baby cannot get trapped between mattress and
crib. 

<br><br><LI>No cracked or peeling paint to prevent lead poisoning. 

<br><br><LI>No splinters or rough edges.

<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission warns of a
strangulation hazard that may exist with some cribs that have
projections on the cornerposts.  Decorative knobs or cornerposts
which extend above the crib end or side have caught clothing,
necklaces and pacifier cords as the child moves about in the
corner areas of the crib.  These knobs or posts have been
implicated in two cases of brain damage and 48 deaths due to
strangulation.  The Commission urges that parents never tie
pacifiers around a child's neck.</P>

<P>     The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (JPMA),
after being alerted to this hazard by the CPSC, developed a
voluntary standard that restricts the height of crib cornerpost
extentions to 1/16 inch unless the posts are high and the tops
are out of reach of a child, such as where the posts are supports
for a canopy.  Most crib manufacturers have already ceased to
produce cribs with post extensions.  However, there may be
thousands of such cribs still in consumers' homes, at garage
sales, or in second-hand furniture stores.</P>

<P>     If you already own a crib with cornerpost extensions more
than 1/16 inch in height, the Commission urges that you remove
the extensions and discard them.  Some may be removed merely by
unscrewing, while others may have to be sawed off and sanded
smooth.  If you are purchasing a new or used crib, look for one
that has cornerpost extensions less than 1/16 inch above the top
edge of the end or side.</P>

<P>     For more information on crib safety, consumers may send a
stamped self-addressed envelope to the Juvenile Products
Manufacturers Association, Two Greentree Center, Suite 225, Box
955, Marlton, NJ 08053.  To report an unsafe consumer product or
a product-related injury, consumers may call the Consumer Product
Safety Commission's toll-free hotline at 1-800-638-2772.  A
teletypewriter number for the hearing impaired is available at
1800-638-8270.</P>

<a name="Choosing"></a>
<h3>Choosing a Preschool Program: First Steps.</h3>

<p>Preschool programs around the country are provided by many
kinds of agencies in a variety of settings. Some are run by local
schools. Some, like Head Start and migrant programs, are
sponsored by federal agencies; others by nonprofit groups such as
churches and United Way agencies. Some are provided by employers,
and others are owned by individuals or franchise chains. Among
all these types of preschool programs, the quality of programs
varies.</p> 

<p>As a parent you may want to assess how well a preschool program will
satisfy your particular needs and preferences. When you decide to look for a
program, you might want to start with a local Child Care Resource and
Referral Agency (1) that is specifically organized to help parents locate
early childhood programs in their communities.</p>

<p>Most preschool programs must conform to state regulations
and satisfy minimal standards of health and safety. Even so, it
is a good idea to ask the staff whether the program is up-to-date
with its state license, and is accredited by the National
Association for the Education of Young Children. The directors of
good programs usually encourage potential clients to visit, with
their child, at any time.</p>

<p>Besides following these initial steps, it is also important,
when choosing a preschool program for your child, to consider
characteristics of your child, of the program, of the preschool
staff, and of the program's physical environment.</p> 


<hr>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
<h3>Characteristics of the Child</h3>

<p>Some children are more comfortable in large groups than others, and will
do well in large programs. On the other hand, if your child takes a long
time to warm up in a crowd, you may want to look for a small-scale preschool
program. If your child seems especially fond of vigorous physical activities
and outdoor play, you may want to ensure that the preschool provides good
outdoor space and equipment. </p>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Program"></a>
<h3>Characteristics of the Program</h3>

<p>It is always advisable to make preliminary visits to as many
preschool programs as possible before making a choice among them. If the
climate in a program is good, this is usually indicated by friendliness
among the staff and children. Children in a good program are not usually
distracted by visitors, but continue to be absorbed in their work and play.
Give yourself time to get a feeling of the general atmosphere of the
classroom and the extent to which children appear comfortable and involved.</p>

     <p>Some questions you can ask about components of the program
include:</p>
<UL>
     <li>Does the program have a clear written statement of its
       goals and philosophy?<br><br>

     <li>Do the goals address ALL areas of children's development,
       including social, emotional, intellectual, and physical
       development?<br><br>

     <li>Does the program offer a balance of individual, small
       group, and large group activities?<br><br>

     <li>Does it offer a balance of spontaneous play and
       teacher-guided activities?<br><br>

     <li>Are children provided regular opportunities for outdoor
       play?<br><br>

     <li>Do the activities provided encourage self-expression;
       allow for the development of various fine and large motor
       skills; and expose the children to literature, language
       experiences, music, art, science, and nature?<br><br>

     <li>Does the program encourage and respond to children's
       spontaneous interests in the beginnings of reading, writing,
       and counting?<br><br>

     <li>Does the staff solicit and follow up children's interests
       in the world around them?<br><br> 

     <li>Do the content and materials of the program reflect
       cultural diversity and nonsexist attitudes?<br><br>

     <li>Is there a balance among small group activities, rest and
       quiet periods, and vigorous outdoor activities?<br><br>
</UL>


<hr>

<a name="Staff"></a>
<h3>Characteristics of the Staff</h3>

<p>Questions to ask about the program staff include:</p>
<UL>
     <li>Are the teachers trained in early childhood education?<br><br>

     <li>Does the director have experience as a teacher?<br><br>

     <li>Does the ratio of adults to children comply with state
       requirements? <br><br>

     <li>Has the staff been stable over the past few years?<br><br> 

     <li>Does the staff welcome parents as visitors and participants,
and respect parents' preferences and ideas?<br><br>   

     <li>In their interactions with children, do the teachers
       express warmth, interest, and respect for each child?<br><br>

     <li>Are the teachers engaged with the children most of the
       time?<br><br>

</UL>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Environment"></a>
<h3>Characteristics of the Physical Environment</h3>

<p>Questions to ask about the physical setting include:</p>
<UL>
     <li>Is there an attractive spacious outdoor area for safe and
       vigorous outdoor play and activity?<br><br>

     <li>Is there a sufficient supply of equipment for the size of
       the group?<br><br>

     <li>Are the children always supervised when outdoors?<br><br>

     <li>Are the snacks and meals of sufficient nutritional
       quality?<br><br>

     <li>Do the classrooms contain different kinds of spaces so 
       that children can find small quiet places when they need
to?<br><br>

</UL>

<hr>

<a name="Summary"></a>
<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Studies suggest that preschool settings are more likely to offer
high-quality programs when the total number of children is small enough to
allow staff to know all the children and their families. Whenever possible,
it is helpful to speak to other parents served by the program about their
experience and recommendations.</p>

<P>	Madison, Wis., Sept. 20, 1996 -- Young girls and teenagers who understand the importance of taking care of their bodies will be less likely to experience premenstrual syndrome ((PMS) later on, according to an article published in the September/October issue of the Women's Health Access newsletter.</P>

<P>	"We know a lot about the critical role our lifestyle plays in managing PMS," says Marla Ahlgrimm, R.PH., Founder and President of Women's Health America Group and publisher of the newsletter. "We also know that severe PMS symptoms can be prevented if young women incorporate good lifestyle habits early on in their development. There's a real opportunity for mothers to help their daughters avoid premenstrual bloating, breast tenderness, food cravings and other symptoms with simple and straightforward education about diet, exercise, and vitamins."</P>

	Women who suffer from PMS themselves may fear that their daughters will have the same experiences, says Stephanie Bender, Director of Full Circle Women's Health in Boulder, Colo. She offers these recommendations to women who want to help their daughters understand PMS and avoid many of its symptoms:

	<ul>
	<li> Be a positive role model, and explain your behavior. "Tell your daughters, "The reason I exercise is to take good care of my body. It helps me with my PMS." Let your daughters see you eating well and taking vitamins, and let them know that these practices help keep your body in balance," she advises.

	<br><br><li> Be honest with your concern. Women whose mothers had PMS and who have struggled with the disorder themselves can make their daughters aware of the risk without scaring them. "You can say, "This is part of my concern for you. PMS doesn't happen to all women, but it does happen to some women."  She also recommends letting your daughters know that help is available for PMS.

	<br><br><li> Take advantage of the opportunity to dispel myths. "Treat PMS as the physiological happening that it is, she counsels. "We want our daughters to understand that PMS is not imaginary, or an excuse to avoid responsibility."

	<br><br><li> Remember that our daughters will have more choices. "Our daughters are in a society that is more aware of women's health issues," says Ms. Bender. Encourage them to take advantage of the information available and to learn about their bodies.

	<br><br><li> Finally, don't expect your daughters to imitate you just yet. "Just because you're taking care of yourself doesn't mean your adolescent daughter is going to follow along. That's probably not realistic, Ms. Bender says. "We can plant seeds that our daughters can use later on. Even if the girls don't act on it immediately, they still have the information and you as their role model.
</ul>

<P>	CHICAGO, Sept. 19, 1996 -- A $500,000 federally funded study of school-based health centers in Chicago high schools has determined that the clinics were effective in reducing cigarette and marijuana use and detecting sexually transmitted diseases, but must increase mental health services to address widespread student depression.</P>

<P>	Researchers at DePaul University, who conducted the study in collaboration with the Ounce of Prevention Fund, said the results have national social policy implications</P>

<P>	About 550 health centers currently exist in schools across America. Researchers recommended that officials in city and suburban school districts consider the benefits clinics have for teens and establish them in their schools.</P>

<P>	The Chicago study, conducted in 1993 and 1994, involved more than 2,000 African American freshmen and juniors in seven public high schools.</P>

<P>	Principal investigator LaVome Robinson, a professor of psychology, at DePaul, worked with collaborators Gary Harper and Michael Schoeny to compare differences between health behaviors of students who attended schools with and without clinics. Their findings indicated that clinics can have an important impact on students' physical and mental health. For example:</P>

<ul>
<LI>Freshmen in schools with and without clinics smoked cigarettes and marijuana at the same rate. At schools with clinics, use of these substances decreased by the time the students were juniors, but increased among juniors at schools lacking clinics. <br><br>

<LI>Students in clinic schools were more likely than their counterparts at non-clinics schools to use birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Students with sexually transmitted diseases were more likely to be diagnosed and treated if they attended clinic schools than non-clinic schools.

</ul>


<P>	Harriet Meyer, executive director of the Ounce of Prevention Fund, said, "This confirms what we have always known: school health centers help students with some of the most challenging problems they face when we find a model that works, we must work to ensure its continued existence."</P>

<P>	Robinson added, "School-based health centers attract and provide services to adolescents who are at risk for such problems as pregnancy, HIV infection and substance abuse. Our study specifically looked at inner-city kids, but we believe clinics can have a positive impact on all teens who confront similar problems."</P>

<P>The study was founded by the National Institute for Mental Health.</P>

<P>	Children, infants and unborn babies are more vulnerable to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning than healthy adults, according to toxicologists and medical professionals. Younger family members are particularly susceptible due to their higher metabolic rates -- meaning they require more oxygen and use it faster than adults. Carbon monoxide even in small amounts works to restrict oxygen in the bloodstream thus starving a child's tissues and organs of what is needed to function and develop properly.</P>

<P>	"Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause neurological problems, learning disabilities, memory lose and personality changes in children and can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth for women exposed during pregnancy," said Dr. Marc Bayer, medical director, Connecticut Poison Control Center. "Because of the higher oxygen requirements of smaller bodies, carbon monoxide's interference with oxygen delivery can lead to permanent damage to a child's developing nervous system," he said.</P>

<P>	According to the National Center for Health Statistics, in 1994 nearly 1,900 children under the age of 6 were reported to have been exposed to carbon monoxide. Additionally, approximately 35 children die each year from CO poisoning -- although medical and health professionals believe the injury and fatality statistics are under-reported due to the tendency of CO poisoning symptoms to mimic viral illnesses like the flu and the lack of a national reporting system.</P>

<P>	Monitored press reports of accidental carbon monoxide deaths chronicle 59 fatalities of children 14 and under from September of 1994 to May 1996, indicating there may be more children affected than current statistics show.</P>

<P>	Carbon monoxide is a natural by-product of combustion, present whenever fuel is burned. Common sources in the home include gas or oil furnaces or hot water heaters, gas clothes dryers, gas ovens and ranges, fireplaces, space heaters, barbecue grills operating in enclosed areas and cars left running in attached garages.</P>

<P>	Young children are also vulnerable to misdiagnosis because they cannot fully explain the onset, progression and severity of their symptoms. Additionally, because children spend most of their time in the home, they are more likely to be exposed to carbon monoxide produced by gas, oil, wood or propane burning appliances and heating systems.</P>

<P>	"Because this toxin is invisible to human senses and the early poisoning symptoms look like other common problems such as the flu, the best way to know if a leak is present is to equip the home with carbon monoxide detectors that have an audible alarm," said Bayer.</P>

<P>	To provide an early warning of carbon monoxide dangers, First Alert(R), the nation's leading brand of carbon monoxide detectors, has developed a battery powered detector that will sense carbon monoxide at lower concentrations than plug-in models are designed to detect. The detector will continue to operate in the event of a power outage, a time when alternative heat sources are commonly  used and can be mounted out of reach of little fingers -- important to children with families.</P>

<P>	Families with children, pregnant women, elderly people or anyone with heart or lung disorders may want the added protection of the First Alert biosensor technology. The elderly and people with heart or lung disorders are at greater risk of injury or death from carbon monoxide because CO can aggravate a pre-existing condition of restricted oxygen flow in the bloodstream.</P>

<P>The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recommends that every home in America install at least one carbon monoxide detector with an audible alarm, located near the sleeping area. Additional detectors on every level and in every bedroom provide an extra measure of safety.</P>

<P>Washington, D.C. -- Having your home inspected each year at
the beginning of the heating season can help avoid deadly
carbon monoxide gas from leaking into your home, according
to Chairman Ann Brown of the Consumer Product Safety
Commission.</P>

<P>"CO poisoning from the use of fuel burning appliances kills
at least 200 people each year and sends more than 5,000 to
hospital emergency rooms for treatment," Brown said.  
"Consumers can avoid this tragedy by having their
fuel-burning appliances inspected by a qualified
technician each year, and by purchasing and installing CO
detectors that meet the requirements of the Oct. 1, 1995
Underwriters Laboratories standards."</P>

<P>CO is a colorless, odorless gas produced by burning any
fuel.  The initial symptoms of CO poisoning are similar to
the flu, and include dizziness, fatigue, headache, nausea
and irregular breathing.  High level exposure to CO can
cause death.</P>

<P>"Modern heating equipment is sophisticated and requires
special training and tools for proper maintenance," Brown
said.  "CPSC recommends that consumers should not service
their own appliances, but instead have a qualified
professional perform an inspection."</P>

<P>A yearly inspection of your home by a professional should
include a careful look at the following sources of carbon
monoxide:</P>

<ul>

<li> Furnaces, hot water heaters and stoves.   If they burn
natural gas, heating oil, wood or other kinds of fuel, these
appliances are potential sources of CO. <br><br>
 
<li> Chimneys, flues and vents.  Have flues and chimneys
inspected before each heating season for leakage and for
blockage by creosote or debris.  Creosote buildup or
leakage could cause black stains on the outside of the
chimney or flue.  These stains can mean that pollutants are
leaking into the house.   Have all vents to furnaces, water
heaters or boilers checked to make sure they are not loose
or disconnected.<br><br>

<li>  High Temperature Plastic Venting (HTPV) pipes.   CPSC
has received reports that high temperature plastic venting
(HTPV) pipes -- which are used in mid-efficiency appliances
-- may separate or crack.  This could allow CO from the
furnace to enter a home.   The CPSC is currently
investigating this problem.  Homeowners with a gas-fired
mid-efficiency furnace or boiler installed between 1987 and 
1993  should have them inspected for cracking or separating.<br><br>

<li> Improper ventilation. Make sure that your appliances
have adequate ventilation.  A supply of fresh air is
important to help carry pollutants up the chimney, stovepipe
or flue, and is necessary for the complete combustion of any
fuel. 

</ul>

<P>Finally, consumers should be aware that charcoal grills can
also be a potential source of CO. Never use charcoal grills
in enclosed spaces such as a home, garage, vehicle or tent,
and never bring grills with live coals indoors after use.  
Never use charcoal grills as an indoor heat source.
 </P> 
<P>"Carbon monoxide is a deadly threat, but it can be avoided
by having a yearly professional inspection of your home fuel
burning appliances and by installing a CO detector that
meets the most recent UL standards," Brown said.</P>

<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death
from 15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction.  To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - As soccer season approaches, the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is urging parents,
coaches, school administrators, park officials, and
players to anchor movable soccer goals to prevent them from
tipping over and crushing children who climb or hang on
them.</P>
<P>     In 1995, CPSC issued voluntary safety guidelines
addressing the design, use, storage, and set-up of movable
soccer goals, which have been responsible for at least 22
deaths and hundreds of serious injuries since 1979. Most of
these deaths and injuries occurred with unanchored homemade
goals including those assembled by high school shop classes
and local businesses.</P>
<P>     In addition to fatal accidents, hospital emergency
rooms treat about 90 soccer goal-related injuries each year. </P>
<P>    "Parents would never think that something that looks so
stable could tip over," said CPSC Chairman Ann Brown.
"Movable soccer goals are a hidden hazard to kids, who can
be hurt or killed even if they're not playing soccer."</P>
<P>     In 1995, the National Federation of State High School
Associations Soccer Rules Committee changed high school
soccer rules to require that soccer goals be anchored at all
times before, during, and after play. In February 1996, the
Canadian Product Safety Bureau adopted CPSC's "Guidelines
for Movable Soccer Goal Safety." CPSC had requested the
Federation Internationale Football Association to consider
similar changes at the international level. The
international association is considering making these
changes to prevent soccer goal tipover.</P>
<P>     "Coaches, parents and CPSC all want the same thing for
kids: we want them to have fun and play soccer safely,"
Brown said. "Parents should check their children's soccer
goals. If the goals aren't anchored, kids shouldn't play."</P>
     CPSC is working with manufacturers, soccer coaches,
school and park officials, and others to distribute
"Guidelines for Movable Soccer Goal Safety." For a copy of
the guidelines,  consumers should send a postcard with their
name and address to Soccer Goal Guidelines, CPSC,
Washington, D.C. 20207.
<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death
from 15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction.  To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on
CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800)

The child's mother works with him or her at home,reading to the child and reading with the child. The child has a tutorat school. The youngster tries with all his/her might, even to thepoint of tears, but the symbols and the words won't stick. Thoughapparently learned today at great pain, tomorrow they will be gone.The question is: what do we know about problem readers that will helpus guide them? This digest will discuss children with readingdifficulties and how these children can be helped to read and learnmore effectively.</P><a name="Dyslexia"></a><H3>Dyslexia</H3><P>Most children begin reading and writing by the first, second, or thirdgrade. By the time they are adults, most can't recall or can'tremember what it was like not to be able to read and write, or howdifficult it was to figure out how to translate patterns on a pageinto words, thoughts, and ideas. These same adults usually cannotunderstand why some children have not yet begun to read and write bythe third grade. They have even more difficulty understanding howadults can function in our society with only the most rudimentaryliteracy skills.</P><P>Dyslexia is perhaps the learning disability that is most widely known,primarily because of Barbara Bush's efforts to make adults aware ofthe problem of children with this and other learning disabilities.Stories about children (and adults) trying to overcome their learningdisabilities appear in the mass media with some regularity. Despitethe relative familiarity of the word "dyslexia," there is noclear-cut, widely accepted definition for dyslexia. In the broadestsense, dyslexia refers to the overwhelming difficulty in learning toread and write by normally intelligent children exposed to suitableeducational opportunities in school and at home. These often veryverbal children's reading levels fall far below what would have beenpredicted for their quick and alert intelligence (Bryant and Bradley,1985).</P><P>Just as educators and researchers cannot agree on a specific andprecise definition of dyslexia, they do not agree on the cause orcauses. Recent research (Vellutino, 1987) has challenged many commonlyheld beliefs about dyslexia: dyslexia results in reversal of letters;dyslexics show uncertain hand preference; children whose firstlanguage is alphabetic rather than ideographic are more likely to havedyslexia; and dyslexia is correctable by developing strategies tostrengthen the child's visual-spatial system. Instead, dyslexia appears to be acomplex linguistic deficiency marked by the inability to represent and accessthe sound of a word in order to help remember the word and the inability tobreak words into component sounds.</P><P>It does appear that there might be a hereditary factor in dyslexia. Inone study of 82 average children with reading problems, the childrenwere divided into two groups, "specifics" (reading and spelling weretheir only difficult school subjects) and "generals" (problems witharithmetic as well as with literacy). When the families of thechildren in both groups were scanned for a history of readingproblems, 40% of the families of the "specifics" showed problems amongrelatives, while among the "generals," only 25% showed problems. Thus,the specific disorder does seem to run in families more than thegeneral disorder--a plus for the hereditary factor in dyslexia(Crowder and Wagner, 1992). More research is testing this factor.</P><P>It is important to remember that not all individuals who have problemswith reading are dyslexic. And the diagnosis of dyslexia should onlybe made by a qualified reading professional. Many slow readers who arenot dyslexic, however, can be helped with a variety of readingexperiences to improve fluency.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="Helping the"></a><H3>Helping the Problem Reader</H3><P>There is growing evidence that it might be more appropriate to referto the amount of time a learner takes to complete a reading taskrather than using qualitative labels, such as good, best, or poorreader (Smith, 1990). If we accept the premise that all individualsare capable of learning to read but some need to stretch theirlearning time, then we can search for adjustments. Slow readers couldread shorter passages. In this way, they could finish a story andexperience the success of sharing it with a parent or friend.</P><P>Let's examine some other conditions that will help improvecomprehension for those learners sometimes labeled reading disabled.Besides reading more slowly, the person with reading difficulties canbe asked to find specific kinds of information in a story, or can bepaired with a more capable reader who will help in summarizing theessential points of the reading or in identifying the main ideas of astory.</P><P>One of the reasons that these learners read more slowly is that theyseem less able to identify the organization of a passage of text (Wongand Wilson, 1984). Since efficient comprehension relies on thereader's ability to see the pattern or the direction that the writeris taking, parents and teachers can help these readers by spendingmore time on building background for the reading selection, both inthe general sense of concept building and in the specific sense ofcreating a mental scheme for the text organization. Many times,drawing a simple diagram can help these readers greatly.</P><P>Direct intervention of parent or teacher or tutor in the comprehensionprocess increases reading comprehension in slower readers (Bos, 1982).These readers often need help with vocabulary and need reminders tosummarize as they proceed. They also need to ask themselves questionsabout what they are reading. The parent can prompt thinking or canprovide an insight into the language that may otherwise elude thereader.</P><P>One effective strategy for slower readers is to generate visual imagesof what is being read (Carnine and Kinder, 1985). For the reader togenerate images, he or she must first be able to recognize the word.Assuming the reader knows how to recognize words, he or she needsconcepts to visualize the flow of action represented on the page. Thesame kind of concept building techniques that work for average readersalso work for slower readers. The slower reader, however, gains morefrom concrete experiences and images than from abstract discussions.It is not enough for the parent to simply tell the slower reader touse visual images--the parent has to describe the images that occur inhis or her own mind as he or she reads a particular passage, thusgiving the child a concrete sense of what visual imagery means.Pictures, physical action, demonstrations, practice using words ininterviews or in an exchange of views among peers are only a few ofthe ways that parents, tutors, or teachers can make the key vocabularytake root in the reader's mind.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr></td></tr></table> <table border=0 valign="top" halign="left" cellpadding="5"><tr><td valign=top halign=left width=100><img src="/images/spacer.gif" haligh=left>                   </td><td valign=top><a name="Helpful"></a><H3>Helpful Reading Materials</H3><P>As is the case with most learners, slower readers learn mostcomfortably with materials that are written on their ability level(Clark et al., 1984). The reading level is of primary concern, butparents can help their reader select helpful materials in other ways.Choose stories or books with (1) a reduced number of difficult words;(2) direct, non-convoluted syntax; (3) short passages that deliverclear messages; (4) subheads that organize the flow of ideas; and (5)helpful illustrations. Older problem readers often find that thenewspaper is a good choice for improving reading comprehension (Monda,et al., 1988). Slow readers can succeed with the same frequency asfaster readers as long as the parent or tutor maintains a positiveattitude and selects materials and approaches that accommodate thechild's learning speeds.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="Importance"></a><H3>Importance of a Positive Attitude</H3><P>A positive attitude on the part of the child is also crucial to thetreatment of difficulties in reading and learning. Tutors who haveworked consistently with problem learners are very aware of the roleof the self in energizing learning, and the potential damage to thesense of self-worth that comes from labeling. Teachers and parentsshould appreciate children's thinking as the foundation of theirlanguage abilities, and maintain some flexibility in theirexpectations regarding their children's development of decoding skillssuch as reading. For children to feel successful, they need to becomeaware of their unique learning strengths, so that they may apply themeffectively while working to strengthen the lagging areas (Webb,1992). The child needs to feel loved and appreciated as an individual,whatever his or her difficulties in school.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="References"></a><H3>References</H3><P>Bos, Candace S.

[NYSE: PFE] announced today that ZITHROMAX(R) (azithromycinfor oral suspension), the first and only antibiotic for children given in 5, once-daily doses isavailable nationwide for the treatment of common bacterial infections, including acute otitis mediacaused by Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Otitis media,an infection of the middle ear, is one of the most common infections in children, accounting for morethan one third of all office visits to pediatricians each year.</P><P> In addition to a simplified dosing regimen, other ZITHROMAX benefits that may enhance parent --and child -- compliance include a low discontinuation rate due to treatment-related side effects anda good cherry taste.</P><P> ZITHROMAX, an effective, antibiotic approved for use in children, offers a simpler dosage regimenthan other antibiotics. The distinct advantage of ZITHROMAX over existing therapy for acute otitismedia is that it can be taken less frequently -- only 5 days, once a day.</P><P>"Most antibiotics used in the treatment of otitis media in children require a two- or three-timesdaily dosing regimen for 10 days," says Michael Pichichero, MD, a pediatrician and professor at theUniversity of Rochester."Given the increasing number of children in either group day care orpreschool centers, multi-dose, multi-day dosing regimens may result in missed doses and unfinishedcourses of therapy which, in turn, can result in treatment failure."</P><P> A recently released report from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that a growing number of children ofworking mothers are cared for in day care or preschool centers. According to the report, Who'sMinding Our Preschoolers?, 30% of the 9.9 million U.S. preschoolers with mothers working outside ofthe home in 1993 were cared for by nonrelatives in day care or preschool centers, an increase from23% in 1991. Children in group day care settings are at an increased risk of developing acute otitismedia due to their repeated exposure to other children's respiratory tract infections, the mostcommon initial event in the pathogenesis of acute otitis media.</P><P> Nearly one half of all U.S. children will have otitis media by 1 year of age and more than 70% byage 3 years. Most children have the infection more than once; in fact, 30% of children suffer six ormore episodes of acute otitis media before entering school. Acute otitis media is the most commonsingle reason for antimicrobial therapy in children, responsible for upward of 31 million visits todoctors and $3 to $4 billion in treatment costs. Left untreated, acute otitis media may result inhearing loss and related difficulties in language development and learning.</P><P> Infants are at risk for acute otitis media largely due to the anatomical positioning of theireustachian tubes. An episode of acute otitis media during the first year of life also increase therisk for recurrence of the condition. Environmental factors can increase the probability ofcontracting the disease and exacerbate the infection. Children with acute otitis media may exhibitthe following signs and symptoms: earache, fever, irritability, sleep disturbances and hearing loss.Vomiting and diarrhea also may be</P><P> "Otitis media is an important public health problem, not only in terms of medical treatment andrelated costs to society, but also in terms of the toll it takes on individual families," says Dr.Pichichero. &quot;The disruption of the family's daily life -- from work schedule and child carearrangements to sleep habits -- combine to cause stress and anxiety as parents cope with a childsuffering from a recurrent illness.</P><P> Several studies have shown an increase in bacterial resistance to existing therapies for otitismedia. While the standard first-line therapy for otitis media is a 10-day course of amoxicillin,recent findings indicate an increasing prevalence of penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae as well asbeta- lactamasc-producing strains of H influenzae and M catarrhalis and suggest a need fortherapeutic alternatives.</P><P> The recommended dose of ZITHROMAX (azithromycin for oral suspension) for the treatment of acuteotitis media is 5 once-daily doses: 10 mg/kg on Day 1, Followed by 5 mg/kg on Days 2 to 5. ZITHROMAXshould be dosed 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. ZITHROMAX is available in a cherry-flavoredsuspension and does not require refrigeration. ZITHROMAX offers an excellent side-effects profile:the most common side effects observed in children with acute otitis media are diarrhea/loose stools(2%), abdominal pain (2%), vomiting (1%), and nausea (1%). ZITHROMAX is contraindicated in patientswith known hypersensitivity to macrolides.</P><P> &quot;For the first time, pediatricians can prescribe an antibiotic for middle ear infectionthat's designed to fit a family's busy schedule -- just once daily for 5 days. The dosage regimen iseasy on parents and even easier on their kids,&quot; says Joseph M. Feczko, MD, Vice President andMedical Director of Pfizer's U.S. Pharmaceuticals Group. As a leader in anti-infective research,Pfizer views the introduction of ZITHROMAX for children as  a major contribution to pediatricmedicine."</P><P> Five-day, once-daily ZITHROMAX is also available in the U.S. for the treatment of respiratorytract and skin infections in adults. ZITHROMAX also is indicated, in a single 1-gm dose, for thetreatment of uncomplicated genital chlamydial infections.</P><P> Pfizer Inc is a research based, diversified health care company with global operations. Thecompany reported sales of more than $10 billion for 1995 and expects to spend about $1.7 billion onresearch and development this year.</P><P> ZITHROMAX(R) (azithromycin for oral suspension) full prescribing information available uponrequest.</P><P>SOURCE Pfizer Inc</P> <P>CONTACT: Lisa Easley of CDB Healthcare, 212-845-4203<BR></P></td></tr></table><hr><center><h4><a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> |<a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |<A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |<a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center><img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left><address>We love to talk with you.

The discussion will be published as a special educational supplement to theOctober issue of &quot;Journal of School Nursing."</P><P>Tinea capitis is the most common pediatric fungal scalp infection worldwide, accounting for over90 percent of fungus infections of the skin in children under the age of 10. It is more common inAfrican-American children, especially those in urban areas, than in white children. While the reasonfor the greater prevalence in this segment of the population is not fully understood, it has beenpostulated that extensive use of hair crossings, such as pomades, and tight hair braiding practicesmay play a role.</P><P> Dr. Mercurio stresses, however, that the infection is known to defy demographics. &quot;Failureto consider ringworm as a possibility in every child carries the risk of missed diagnoses, withresulting absence of treatment, persistent infection and unwanted transmission to others.</P><P> Recognition of ringworm of the scalp is difficult because the symptoms often mimic other scalpconditions. Typical early signs include redness, itching, and flaking.</P><P> The average ringworm patient is between four-and six-years-old. In addition to schools, outbreakshave been noted in day-care centers, as well as in nurseries among infants as young as nine-days old,and frequently among high-school age athletes, particularly wrestlers. Tinea capitis is also becomingincreasingly common in adults.</P><P> The infection spreads through close human contact, as well as from contact with inanimate objectssuch as combs and brushes, barrettes, bed linens, stuffed animals, telephones, wrestling mats, andtheater seat-backs.</P><P> Topical therapy is not effective in eradicating tinea capitis. The only medication currentlyindicated for the treatment of tinea capitis is griseofulvin, which has been the standard oftreatment for the condition for nearly 40 years.</P><P> One form of griseofulvin, available in a liquid suspension formulation for children, is GRIFULVINV(R) (griseofulvin oral suspension). Parents may find that the liquid suspension form is easier andmore pleasant for children to take, which may increase the likelihood of compliance with the fullregimen. When side effects occur, they are most commonly of the hypersensitivity type, such as skinrashes and hives. </p><P>&quot;Compliance is crucial to treatment,&quot; emphasizes Dr. Mercuric. &quot;The fullcourse of treatment must  be  completed without regard to whether symptoms have improved.&quot;</P><P>For a free flyer, &quot;What Can I do to Reduce The Spread of Ringworm of theScalp?,&quot; consumers can send a self-addressed-stamped-envelope to:</P><P>What Can I Do? <br>c/o Lark Fulfillment Inc.<br> 309 Pierce Street<br> Box M <br>Somerset, NJ 08873</P><P>SOURCE Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation</P><P> CONTACT: Gary Esterow of Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, 908-218-6637, or Lindy Moran of MoranCommunications, 212-966-4187</P></td></tr></table><hr><center><h4><a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> |<a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |<A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |<a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center><img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left><address>We love to talk with you.

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC), Gerber Products Co. of Fremont, Mich.,
is voluntarily recalling approximately 60,000 Flip Fingers
Rattles in one style. The spherical end-caps of the rattle may
separate releasing small parts, such as spinning pieces and
noise-making beads, which present a choking and inhalation hazard
to young children. </P>
<P>     Gerber received five reports of these rattles breaking. CPSC
and Gerber have not received any reports of injuries. This recall
is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury.</P>
<P>     This recall involves Flip Fingers Rattles with red, U-shaped
handles embossed with the word "Gerber." The rattles, measuring
5.25 inches long by 2.5 inches wide, have yellow spherical ends
holding multi-colored spinning parts. Flip Fingers Rattles with
green handles are not included in this recall.</P>
<P>     Grocery stores and a few specialty stores sold the rattles
nationwide from May 1996 through September 1996 for about $1.40.
The rattles came in clear plastic packages on a blue card labeled
in part, "Gerber Flip Fingers Rattle ... number 76250."</P>

<P>     Consumers should take the rattles away from children
immediately and call Gerber at (800) 4-GERBER. Gerber will send
consumers mailing materials and instructions for returning the
rattles to the company to receive a refund. For more information,
consumers should call (800) 4-GERBER.</P>
<P>     Media inquiries should be directed to Van Hindes at Gerber
Products Co., (616) 928-2782, or Gary Rudnick at Golin/Harris,
(312) 836-7112.</P>
<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the
public from unreasonable risks of injury or death from 15,000
types of consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction. To
report a dangerous product or a product-related injury and for
information on CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline

To find the closest SSA office, phone 1-(800) 772-1213.</P><P> When applying for SSDI, applicants should bring the following documentation to the initialinterview:</P><ul><li> Social Security number and proof of age for each person applying for benefits. <br><br><li> Names, addresses and phone numbers of doctors, hospitals, clinics, and institutions that haveprovided treatment and the dates of treatments. <br><br><li>A work history for the past 15 years. <br><br><li> A copy of the most recent W-2 form or if applicants have been self-employed, their federal taxreturn for the past year.</ul><P> If someone does not have all the above items, apply anyway. The people in the Social Securityoffice can help obtain needed information.</P><a name="disability"></a><H3> Disability Determination</H3><P> After completing the SSDI application, the paper work is forwarded to the state's DisabilityDetermination Services (DDS) office where an evaluation team consisting of a physician or apsychologist and a disability-evaluation specialist will determine disability using the followingcriteria.</P><ul> <li>If a person earns more than $500 a month, he/she generally cannot receive SSDI.<br><br><li> The disability must interfere with basic work related activities.<br><br><li> If the disability is on the list Social Security maintains, the claim is automaticallyprocessed. If the disability is not on the list, Social Security will determine if it is of severityequal to one on the list.<br><br><li> The disability must interfere with the individual's ability to do the same kind of work  he orshe did for the past 15 years.<br><br><li> The disability must prevent a person from doing any other type of work for which he or she isqualified.</ul><a name="Employment"></a><H3> Employment Requirement</H3> <P>To qualify for SSDI, a person must have worked long enough and recently enough under SocialSecurity. A person can earn a maximum of four work credits per year. The number of work creditsneeded to receive SSDI depends on when the disability started. For more information on work credits,please call Social Security at 1 (800) 772-1213.</P><a name="Benefit"></a><H3> Benefit Payment</H3>  <P>(SSDI) will not begin until the sixth full month after the onset of thedisability. The claims process is long because of the need to obtain medical information and toassess the disability in terms of the ability to work.</P><P> After Disability Determination Services (DDS) forwards the claim, the applicant will receive thefirst SSDI check dating back to the sixth month from the on set of the disability.</P><a name="Review"></a><H3> Disability Review</H3><P>A person's eligibility will be reviewed periodically: however, the frequency depends upon thefollowing:</P><ul> <li>If medical improvement is expected, there will be a review within 6 to 18 months <br><br> <li> If medical improvement is possible, there will be a review no sooner than 3 years  and<br><br> <li> If medical improvement is not expected, there will be a review no sooner than 7 years.</ul><P> There are three ways a child might be eligible for special benefits from Social Security.</P><a name="SSI"></a> <H3>SSI Benefits for Children</H3>  <P>  These are benefits payable to children with disabilities who are under the age of 18 because aparent is collecting retirement or disability benefits from Social Security or children who areentitled to benefits because the child is under the age of 18 and a parent has died.</P><P> Although children eligible for these benefits might be disabled, their disability does not needto be considered to qualify them for benefits. In other words, a child under the age of 18 iseligible for SSI merely because he or she is the dependent child of someone getting retirement ordisability benefits or has had a parent who died. Note: A child can continue receiving dependents orsurvivors benefits until age 19 if he/she is a full-time student in elementary or High School.</P><P> Social Security Benefits for Adults Disabled since Childhood -- The benefits explained in theprevious section normally stop when a child has reached the age of 18 (or 19 if the child is afull-time student). However, those benefits will continue to be paid into adulthood if the child isdisabled. To qualify for these benefits, an individual must be the son or daughter of someone who isgetting Social Security retirement or disability benefits or of someone who has died, and that childmust have a disability that began prior to age 22.</P><a name="Non-Medical"></a><H3> SSI Benefits for Children with Disabilities Non-Medical Rules</H3><P> Social Security Income is a program that pays monthly benefits to people with low incomes andlimited assets who are 65 or older, blind, or have a disability. Children can qualify if they meetSocial Security's definition of disability and if their income and assets fall within the eligibilitylimits.</P><P> As its name implies, Supplemental Security Income supplements a person's income up to a certainlevel. The level varies from one state to another and can go up every year on the bases ofcost-of-living increases.</P><a name="Rules"></a><H3>Rules for Children under 18</H3>  <P> Most children do not have their own income and do not have many assets. However, when childrenunder the age of 18 live at home (or are away at school but return home occasionally and are subjectto parental control), evaluators consider the parent's income and assets when they decide if thechild qualifies. They refer to this process as the &quot;deeming&quot; of income and assets.</P><a name="Older"></a> <H3>Rules for Children 18 and Older</H3> <P>  When a child turns 18, evaluators no longer consider a parent's income and assets when theydecide if he or she can get SSI. A child who was not eligible for SSI before his or her 18th birthdaybecause a parent's income or assets were too high may become eligible at 18.</P><a name="Deciding"></a><H3> Deciding SSI Disability for Children under 18</H3><P> Of course, a child's disability cannot be evaluated using these work-related adult criteria. Thelaw states that a child will be considered disabled if he or she is not working and has an impairmentthat is as severe as one that would disable an adult. This means that the condition must limit thechild's ability to function like other children of the same age to such a degree that the impairmentis comparable to one that would make an adult disabled.</P><a name="Message"></a><H3>Message to Parents of Children with Severe Disabilities</H3><P> The disability- evaluation process generally takes several months, but the law includes specialprovisions for any individual (including a child) signing up for SSI disability whose condition is sosevere that they are presumed to be disabled. In such cases SSI benefits are paid for up to sixmonths while the formal disability decision is being made. Following are some of the disabilitycategories under which evaluators can presume the child is disabled and make immediate SSI payments:HIV infection, blindness, deafness (in some cases), Cerebral Palsy (in some cases), Down Syndrome,Muscular Dystrophy (in some cases), significant mental deficiency, diabetes (with amputation of onefoot), amputation of two limbs or amputation of leg at the hip. If special payments are made and itis later decided that the child's disability is not severe enough to qualify for SSI, the benefits donot have to be paid back</P><a name="credits"></a><h3>Credits</h3><P> Information adapted from <B>A Separate Voice</B>, spring 1995, a publication of the AdvocacyCenter for Persons with Disabilities, Inc., and Social Security and SSI Benefits for Children withDisabilities, January 1993, a publication of the US Department Health and Human Services.</P><a href="#top">Back to top</a></td></tr></table><hr><center><h4> <a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |  <a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |    <a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> | <a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |    <A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |  <a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center> <img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left>   <address>We love to talk with you.

Simply stated, learning disabilities are troubles children might have withskills such as listening reading, writing, spelling or speaking. These skill impairments have littleto do with a child's intelligence - in fact, most learning- disabled children have normal or higherintelligence, and some who are gifted.</p><P> The following information lists five major types of learning disabilities, and what parents cando to help. Children can begin to show signs of these disabilities during preschool, early grades andthroughout their academic careers - so be sure to watch children for the warning signs below.</P><a name="language"></a><H3> Language Disabilities </H3><P> Signs include a child: asking for repeated information; misunderstanding directions, havingtrouble remembering and following directions; having trouble expressing himself or herself; and usingincorrect grammar beyond an appropriate age (such as saying &quot;I don't got none&quot; for &quot;ldon't have any&quot; by school age). Parents can help improve language skills by reading to childreneveryday. In addition, trips that expose them to language through conversations, such as to museumsand zoos, are excellent vocabulary builders.</P><a name="speech"></a><H3> Speech Disabilities </H3><P> These include slurred speech, stuttering and lisping which can all affect a child's ability tocommunicate by making them hesitant to speak because of embarrassment. Children may also beembarrassed by hoarseness of voice or monotone, which can be caused for many reasons. For all thesespeech disabilities, a parent can repeat back the correct way to pronounce words through normal andfrequent conversation.</P><a name="reading"></a><H3> Reading Disabilities and Dyslexia </H3><P>Children who show little interest in reading and the reading portions of educational televisionmay have a reading disability. Reading difficulty can be caused by a variety of factors, so a readingevaluation is necessary to determine exactly what causes the trouble. Parents can help develop achild's reading skills by reading along and pointing at each word to match the words up withsounds.</P><a name="writing"></a><H3> Writing Disabilities</H3><P> Writing disabilities may be caused by underdeveloped muscles in the hands or trouble with thecombination of senses used to write. Arts and crafts, as well as hand-eye games such as jump rope andmarbles, are excellent ways to develop the skills required for writing.</P><a name="math"></a><H3> Math Disabilities</H3> <P> Any problems with math, such as poor grades or general frustration, may signal a math disability.Parents can point out the math in every day situations, such as setting the table and making change.In each case, it helps to provide a visual symbol along with the number to increase comprehension(such as two cups + three cups = five cups).</P><P> In most cases, whatever the disability may be, both children and parents must remember that thereis nothing wrong with the child or the child's intelligence. Just like learning a new position inbaseball or learning a new piece on the piano, families must approach these challenges as newobstacles to overcome.</P><P> If you suspect any of these disabilities in a child, consult your doctor and the child'steachers.</P><P>Reprinted from Triaminic Parents Club, winter 1996</P><a href="#top">Back to top</a></td></tr></table><hr><center><h4> <a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |  <a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |    <a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> | <a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |    <A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |  <a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center> <img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left>   <address>We love to talk with you.

But for others, dietis only a piece of the puzzle and remedial help will be needed as well.</P><a name="begin"></a><H3>Begin by identifying the problems </H3><p>There are practical steps parents and teachers can take to enable a child with &quot;ADD&quot; tolearn and succeed, but most parents and teachers don't really know how to accomplish this. A good wayto begin is to try to determine when the child seems to have problems, why, and to identify thedysfunction. A child may have a problem with only one teacher, one subject, or in one room in theschool. For example, large, noisy rooms such as cafeterias and gyms tend to overwhelm somechildren.</P><a name="iep"></a><H3>The IEP</H3> <p>After a need is identified it should be written into the IEP, the '`individualized educationalprogram&quot; or plan of action the school is required to follow for a child with disabilities. Theseinterventions can be effective if everyone involved -- parents, teachers and school staff participatein the plan.</P><a name="diet"></a><H3>A special diet</H3> <p>If there is a need identified, such as adherence to a diet, this must be written into the IEP. Onceit is completed it is very hard to go back and have something added in. Have your doctor write on hisletterhead that the child has a need for a restricted diet, and it must be followed as the parentoutlines. This gives you a lot of power.</P><a name="ask"></a><H3>Ask the child </H3><p>Not only do the adults need to be involved, but the child should be encouraged to give feedback. Askthe child if he feels the plan is helping him. If a youngster feels something is &quot;dumb&quot; itprobably isn't helping. Even young children can be asked, but it's especially important that theolder child (10-12 years old) be asked.</P>Also, don't lose sight of the fact that learning should be fun.</P><a name="furniture"></a><H3>Furniture </H3><p>The desk and chair need to be the right size. When children are uncomfortable in desks and chairsthat are not in proportion, they are going to squirm and fidget. If his feet don't touch the ground,he will swing them. At the very least, place an old telephone book on the floor so the child can resthis feet solidly on a surface.</P><p>If you're uncomfortable in your chair because your legs hit the edge of the seat in an uncomfortableway, you will move around in an attempt to become more comfortable.</P><p>A youngster should be able to put his elbows on the surface of the desk, and have his chin fitcomfortably in the palm of his hand. With these proportions he can write without having to bendover.</P><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a><a name="floor"></a><H3>Floor plan</H3><p>Where the child sits is important. Teachers generally want to put difficult kids in a back corner --as far away as they can. But the problem this causes is that now the child sees everything that goeson in the classroom; the further back he is, the harder it will be for the child to focus on what isbeing taught.</P><p>The best place for a distractible child is right up in the first row, preferably in front of theteacher's desk. This will limit the amount of activity the child is exposed to.</P><a name="secret"></a><H3>Secret signals</H3><p>Such a seating arrangement also allows the teacher to use a system of signaling the child. The twoagree to a signal, perhaps the teacher touching the child's shoulder, as the reminder that he needsto focus. She can then signal the child without having to call attention to him or interruptteaching.</P><p>Some children need to move around more than others. Some do well until they get&quot;overloaded&quot; with stimuli, and then need to retreat to a place where they can be bythemselves and regain control. Some teachers allow a younger child to move around the classroom aslong as he does not disrupt the other children. An older child might be allowed to ask to go to thenurse's office, so he can get himself back together.</P><p>I've had people tell me the child may abuse the privilege and leave the classroom too often. That'strue, but this will tell you more about where the problem is. If it always occurs with the samesubject or with the same teacher, then you will have some information about the problem. But theother side of the coin is that when we can give the distractible child more power over hisenvironment, he will often use it wisely.</P> <a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a> <a name="predictable"></a><H3>Be predictable</H3> <p>Structure and consistency are very important for the child who still feels some internal chaos. Thereshould be immediate consequences for mistakes, but for the most part it should be private. When achild is scolded in front of the class it gives the class the ability to ridicule him.</P> <p>Each party should know in advance what the rules are, and the consequence for not adhering to them.These consequences should be obvious and appropriate. Take the child aside and explain what is wrong.It's important to know that the child understands he broke a rule, and which rule it was. Many times,a distracted child really won't know what he did wrong. See if he can tell you.</P>  <p>It may be appropriate for older children to have a say in planning the consequences. This empowers achild, and he is more likely to follow rules when he had a part in developing them.</P> <a name="perfect"></a><H3>Picture perfect</H3> <p>It's easy to write a list of rules for children who can read, but for the younger one, pictures canwork well. A parent can use this technique at home and the child might enjoy it even more it you havephotos of him. For example, a checklist for a school day may be: waking up, brushing teeth, gettingdressed, eating breakfast, etc.</P><p>Checklists are helpful for everyone, but they are especially important for disorganizedchildren.</P><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a><a name="something"></a><H3>Something different </H3><p>Some children don't deal well with change. A new classroom, new teacher, new desk, new classmates canall be upsetting. What looks like odd behavior may simply be a child's inability to adapt to thechanges that are required of him.</P><p>Middle school can be especially difficult as the student is expected to change classes, use a locker,etc. Here is where extra help and lots of patience are in order.</P><p>Minimal rules and minimal choices are best for these children. In order to stay calm and be morefocused they need to clearly know what's expected of them -- they can stand in the middle of aclassroom and be totally unaware of what they're supposed to be doing next. It's especially hard ifthey're in a large, confusing place such as a cafeteria or gym, where they may get overexcited andhave trouble calming down. Compensate by gradually decreasing the activity, or by letting the childknow that gym will be over in ten minutes so he can begin to calm himself.</P><a name="thing"></a><H3>One thing at a time</H3><p>Parents and teachers get exasperated at the child who can't remember a series of directions. Ask himto go up to his room, get a sweater, and bring it downstairs. By the time he reaches his room hehasn't a clue why he's there. Most children hear the first direction, but lose it after that.</P> <p>When you give this child directions, have the child look at you. Watch his eyes. The minute his eyesgo up toward the ceiling, he will not hear the next word you say. You then remind him, &quot;No, payattention,&quot; and have the child repeat the directions. If he does, most likely he will thenremember what's been said.</P><p>Most kids hear the first direction; then their eyes leave, their body leaves, and they haven't heardthe rest. Games like &quot;Simon says&quot; can help with learning to pay attention.</P><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a><a name="bite"></a><H3>Bite-size pieces</H3> <p>Help the child learn how to break a project down into smaller sections. Children are assignedreports, but they are rarely taught how to do this. Many youngsters, not just those with attentiondeficits, are told to read a book and then write about it, but don't know how to do it.</P> <p>If the book is one that can be written in, use a highlighter pen (not a perfumed or smelly one) andshow the child how to highlight one sentence in each paragraph which tells what that paragraph says.If the book cannot be written in, or if photocopies are not an option, then have him write the keysentence on a separate paper.</P> <p>At the end of the chapter put all of the sentences together in a paragraph, and this will tell youwhat is contained in each chapter. This is helpful even for young children, where the books areshort.</P><p>This works for math problems too. If the problem is a written one, such as &quot;Mary has two applesand John has three&quot; show the child how to underline the important facts: two, plus, three. It'sthen nothing more complicated than addition.</P><p>Long range projects are very hard for the disorganized student. They need to make lists, but also touse a calendar to plan each step of the project. If a report is due in 4 weeks, they need to see howmuch should be read each day. Breaking down assignments into smaller, do-able steps can help them tokeep on target.</P><a href="#top">Back to top</a></td></tr></table><br><hr><center><h4> <a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |  <a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |    <a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> | <a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |    <A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |  <a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center> <img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left>   <address>We love to talk with you.

<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 6,1996 -- Two to four percent of America's children develop strabismus and/or amblyopia. The American Academy of Ophthalmology says early detection and treatment of these disorders during childhood are essential for preventing permanent vision loss.
</P>

<P>
<B>What Are Strabismus and Amblyopia?
</B></P>

<P>
 Strabismus is misalignment of the eyes. One eye may look straight ahead, while the other turns inward, outward, upward or downward. Although the problem appears to be improperly coordinated eye muscles, it is sometimes accompanied by vision loss.
</P>

<P>
 Amblyopia is reduced vision in one or both eyes as a consequence of failure to develop normal sight in early childhood. Amblyopia can result from a number of underlying abnormalities, including strabismus and focusing abnormalities.
</P>

<P>
<B>Detection of Amblyopia and Strabismus
</B></P>

<P>
 Vision screening can successfully detect reduced vision in one or both eyes resulting from amblyopia, strabismus, or focusing abnormalities. Pediatricians and other primary care physicians usually perform initial screening of babies and young children. Often, schools are responsible for detecting decreased vision in older children.
</P>

<P>
 Children with a family history of strabismus or amblyopia are at higher risk for development of these conditions and should see an ophthalmologist by the age of one.
</P>

<P>
 According to Dr. Susan Day, a San Francisco-based pediatric ophthalmologist and Academy spokesperson, the type of treatment that a child receives is dependent upon the underlying causes of amblyopia or strabismus. Prescription glasses often correct both misalignment of the eyes and visual disorders.
</P>

<P>
<B>Treatment Options
</B></P>

<P>
 Eye patching, also known as occlusion therapy, is another common treatment for amblyopia and strabismus. Patching a child's stronger eye forces him or her to use the weaker eye. Eye muscle surgery is another treatment option for some causes of strabismus. During the surgery, an ophthalmologist strengthens or weakens a patient's eye muscles. For some individuals, treatment with Botox, or botulinum toxin, is an alternative to eye muscle surgery. Botox injections weaken eye muscles pharmacologically, rather than surgically.
</P>

<P>
 As a general rule, all forms of treatment for strabismus and amblyopia work best when initiated in young patients. Regardless of their age, children should visit an ophthalmologist promptly if screening efforts indicate possible strabismus or amblyopia.
</P>

<P>
As Dr. Day emphasizes, &quot;No child is too young to receive treatment!&quot;
</P>

<P>
 For more information about amblyopia and strabismus, send a self- addressed, stamped envelope to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, P.O. Box 7424, San Francisco, CA 94120-7424.

<P>     Kids all across the country have opinions about bike
helmets.  Some kids wear them.  Others don't.  And many kids have
ideas on how to get others to wear bike helmets more often.</P>

<P>     We asked 282 kids, ages 8 to 13, from schools in
Pennsylvania, Florida, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Mexico, New York,
Nebraska, and Washington, just what they thought about bike
helmets.</P>

<P>Look what they had to say!</P>

<a name="Crash"></a>
<H3>What Could Happen If You Were Had a Bike Crash and
Weren't Wearing a Helmet?</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>"You could be paralyzed, killed, or you could suffer damage."
	<LI>"You could bust your head open on the sidewalk or a rock."
	<LI>"You could go into a coma."
	<LI>"You could break your neck or crack your head."
	<LI>"You could have serious brain damage and you might have to
	     learn all you know over again."
</UL>

<H4>FACTS</H4>

<P>     You may think you're a pretty good biker, but crashes happen
all the time to very good riders.  In fact:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>    Wearing a bike helmet is the single most important thing you
     can do to protect your brain - and your life - when you ride
     your bike.
     
<LI>    Children between ages 5 and 14 have the highest rate of
     injury of all bicycle riders.
     
<LI>    Each year, more than 500,000 children go to hospital
     emergency rooms or doctors' offices due to bicycle injuries.
     
<LI>    More than half of these collisions happen on neighborhood
     streets, sidewalks, or playgrounds.

<H3>Why Do You Wear a Bike Helmet?</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>    "I wear a helmet because I had an accident and I was wearing
     a helmet and my head felt fine."
<LI>    "Because it looks cool and it keeps my head safe."
<LI>    "Because I don't want to hurt my head like my cousin (who
    almost died in a bike accident)."
<LI>    "I wear my helmet most of the time because there is law
     about helmets."
<LI>    "I wear my helmet all the time because 1) my parents make me
     and 2) I don't want to get any head injuries."
<LI>    "You should always wear them because they keep you and your
     brain safe."
</UL>

<H4>FACTS</H4>
<P>     Nationally, only about 15 percent of all kids wear bike
helmets.  In this AAA survey of school children, here's how often
kids wore bike helmets:</P>

<P>     Helmet usage of the surveyed kids is better than the
national average.  Even so, more than half of the children
surveyed don't wear bike helmets most of the time.  This means
lots of these kids could be injured riding bikes.</P>

<P>With many families' "back-to-school" preparations well underway,
the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission urges parents to
include bicycle helmets on the list of items for those youngsters
planning to bike to school.</P>

<P>Each year about 1,200 bicyclists are killed and more than half a
million bicycle-related injuries are treated in hospital
emergency rooms. About one-third of these deaths and two-thirds
of the injuries involve school age children under the age of 15.
Three out of four of the deaths are due to head trauma and about
one-third of the injuries are to the head or face. It is
estimated that helmets are now worn by fewer than one out of 10
bicyclists. Some of these deaths and injuries could have been
prevented if the rider had been wearing a helmet.</P>

<P>The purpose of a helmet is to absorb the energy of an impact to
minimize or prevent a head injury. Crushable, expanded
polystyrene foam generally is used for this purpose. Many helmets
also have a hard outer shell which can provide additional
protection to the head in the event of a collision with a sharp
object.</P>

<P>A bicycle helmet should have a snug but comfortable fit on the
rider's head. Some helmets are available with several different
thicknesses of internal padding to custom fit the helmet to the
user. If a parent is buying a helmet for a child, the CPSC
recommends that the child accompany the parent so that the helmet
can be tested for a good fit.</P>

<P>For a helmet to provide protection during impact, it must have a
chin strap and buckle that will stay securely fastened. No
combination of twisting or pulling should remove the helmet from
the head or loosen the buckle on the strap. Children should be
instructed to always wear the helmet with the chin strap firmly
buckled while bicycling.</P>

<P>There are two nationally recognized voluntary safety standards
for bicycle helmets sold in the United States. Both of these
safety standards contain requirements for the helmet features
discussed above. When purchasing a helmet, consumers are urged to
examine the helmet and accompanying instructions and safety
literature carefully. The CPSC recommends that bicyclists
consider wearing only those helmets that are labeled as
conforming with the voluntary standards. The CPSC is currently
evaluating bicycle helmet safety standards to determine if their
effectiveness can be increased. The CPSC's 1974 bicycle regulations require reflectors on the
front and rear of the bicycle, on the pedals, and reflective
tire sidewalls or wheel rims or spoke-mounted reflectors. Other
safety precautions for higher visibility and dusk and night
bicycling are to install and use front and rear lights on the
bicycle and to wear clothing with reflective tape or markings.</P>

<P>On May 15, 1989, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) and the CPSC signed a Memorandum of
Understanding to improve the safety of bicyclists. NHTSA states
that many bicycle-car crashes can be avoided by applying the
rules of the road and by increasing attentiveness of cyclists and
motorists. Bicyclists have a legal right to share the road, but
they are often not noticed in traffic. Drivers should always keep
an eye out for bicyclists, especially when turning, merging,
changing lanes, or entering intersections. NHTSA is distributing
a bicycle safety information sheet for parents of school age
children. For a copy, write to: U.S. Department of
Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
400 7th Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20590.</P>

<P>Educators are voicing concerns regarding the place of literature in
the classroom, calling for the use of literature to supplement basal
readers in the elementary curriculum and raising questions about the
knowledge base of senior high students in literature and history
(Ravitch &#38; Finn, 1987). Meanwhile, school systems are expanding their
offerings for gifted students.</P>

<P>At the confluence of these trends stands the gifted student, whose
particular reading requirements teachers, librarians, and both reading
consultants and consultants in gifted and talented education attempt
to meet. These professionals face the perplexing questions of how to
offer challenging reading to gifted students, how to guide their
reading, and how to know what books to recommend to them or their
parents. Another relevant concern is how to develop programs that use
literature in ways that are the most helpful to gifted students and
make the most effective use of their abilities. In programs for gifted
students it is important to go beyond a basic response to the need for
more literature in the curriculum.</P>

<P>One way to approach the question of guiding gifted readers is to
consider their intellectual and emotional development in light of
reading and literature. What are the intellectual and emotional
challenges they face specifically because they are gifted? What
reading programs can be offered to help them meet these challenges
successfully?</P>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
<H3>Characteristics of the Gifted Child As Reader</H3>

<P>As is so often the case in gifted education, we can express the
reading characteristics of gifted children by using variations on the
word more. They read earlier; some are spontaneous preschool readers,
and nearly all learn to read independently soon after classroom
instruction begins. They read better, requiring less drill (if any) to
master each technique of the reading process. They read longer; during
the peak reading years (grades four through eight) many of them spend
many more hours each week reading than their classmates do, and some
gifted youngsters continue to be voracious readers into senior high
and adulthood, when most people find less time for leisure reading
(Whitehead, 1984). Typically they read a greater variety of
literature; they are more likely to branch out from realistic fiction
to fantasy, historical fiction, and biography (Hawkins, 1983).</P>

<a name="Reading"></a>
<H3>Reading and Intellectual Development</H3>

<P>The presence of an ability implies a need for the opportunity to
develop that ability. Thus Barbara Clark (1983) outlined cognitive
characteristics that differentiate gifted children from others, and
then went on to list needs related to each characteristic. Her list
includes the following needs:</P>

<UL>
<LI>To be exposed to new and challenging information about the
environment and the culture.

<LI>To be exposed to varied subjects and concerns.

<LI>To be allowed to pursue ideas as far as their interests take them.

<LI>To encounter and use increasingly difficult vocabulary and concepts.

<LI>To be exposed to ideas at rates appropriate to the individual's pace
of learning.

<LI>To pursue inquiries beyond allotted time spans.
</UL>

<P>All of these needs can be met easily and inexpensively through a
program based on books and reading. If the opportunity for group book
discussion is added, the program will also meet other cognitive needs
listed by Clark:</P>

<UL>
<LI>To have access to intellectual peers.

<LI>To share ideas verbally in depth.

<LI>To have a longer incubation time for ideas.

<LI>To pursue ideas and integrate new ideas without forced closure or
products demanded.

<LI>To build skills in productive thinking.

<LI>To draw generalizations and test them.<BR><BR>

<a name="Books"></a>
<H3>Promoting Intellectual Development Through Books</H3>

<P>Teachers working with groups of gifted students can use books to
promote intellectual development by (a) using literature as a
supplement to the readings in basal texts, (b) forming discussion
groups based on books, and (c) following programs such as the Junior
Great Books discussion format.</P>

<P>As interest grows in the use of literature in the reading curriculum,
textbook publishers are beginning to supply appropriate materials.
Teachers can also develop their own programs by requiring students to
read whole books in addition to their reading in the basal series. For
gifted students, this requirement can be positive, rewarding them for
something they already enjoy. Students can keep reading notebooks, in
which they write title, author, date read, and a short comment on the
book. To ensure both quality control and choice, it is best if the
student can select the required reading from a list prepared by the
teacher or librarian.</P>

<P>Book discussions can be led by teachers, librarians, or volunteers and
should focus on themes and ideas in the literature read, with the
emphasis on higher level thinking skills rather than on plot summaries
and fact questions.</P>

<P>One formalized method of discussing literature is that promoted by The
Great Books Foundation. The Junior Great Books program offers a series
of 12 readings for each grade from 2nd through 12th, as well as
training courses for leaders.</P>

<P>For individual gifted students, books can be part of the educational
program if an adult (parent, teacher, librarian, or other mentor)
offers reading guidance, discussing what the student has read and
making suggestions for related reading--always keeping in mind the
student's interests, reading ability, and reading background. The goal
is to expose the student to a variety of books of high quality and
stretch the student a little beyond his or her previous awareness.
Gifted students do not automatically know what is good literature;
they need information and guidance to find the best.</P>

<P>Adults offering reading guidance or leading book discussion groups
will need suggestions for books that are appropriate for gifted
students. The most extensive lists available are found in "Books for
the Gifted Child" (Baskin &#38; Harris, 1980), "Books for the Gifted
Child, Volume 2" (Hauser &#38; Nelson, 1988) and "Guiding Gifted Readers"
(Halsted, 1988).</P>

<a name="Development"></a>
<H3>Literature and Emotional Development</H3>

<P>In recent years educators and parents have become more aware of the
need to nurture the social and emotional development of gifted
children in addition to meeting their intellectual needs. Gifted
children and youth must face the same challenges as they grow that
everyone else faces, but the phenomenon of giftedness can make growing
up more difficult for them. They may experience isolation, feelings of
difference and even inferiority, and the sense of being misunderstood
or not understood by their classmates and by adults. Because of their
extreme sensitivity and intensity, they may be more seriously affected
by teasing and criticism than most. They must continually choose
between the alternatives of using their ability or fitting in with
their group (Gross, 1989).</P>

<P>These affective concerns can also be addressed through the use of
books. In many novels for children and young people, the issues just
listed are major themes, whether or not the characters are identified
as gifted. Adults who read and discuss such books with gifted young
people can guide them in preparing for or coping with the extra
dimensions that being gifted adds to the process of growing up.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Promoting"></a>
<H3>Promoting Emotional Development Through Books</H3>

<P>Those who use book discussions to meet emotional needs are using a
form of DEVELOPMENTAL BIBLIOTHERAPY. Developmental bibliotherapy
offers a way of assisting individuals who are facing a particular life
stage or a specific situation--such as giftedness--for which they can
be better prepared through reading and discussion. Rather than merely
recommending a book to a child, it includes three components:  a
reader, a book, and a leader who will read the same book and prepare
for productive discussion of the issues the book raises.</P>

<P>To be effective, the leader must be aware of the process of
bibliotherapy: IDENTIFICATION, in which the reader identifies with a
character in the book; CATHARSIS, the reader's experiencing of the
emotions attributed to the character; and INSIGHT, the application of
the character's experience to the reader's own life. The leader then
frames questions that will confirm and expand on these elements.</P>

<P>Like reading guidance, developmental bibliotherapy can be used with
individuals or with groups. However, using it well requires more
background than reading guidance, and the leader must be alert for
indications that the child should be referred to a mental health
professional. More information on developmental bibliotherapy can be
found in GUIDING GIFTED READERS (Halsted, 1988), and background
information on clinical bibliotherapy, the forerunner of developmental
bibliotherapy, can be found in BIBLIOTHERAPY: THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS
(Hynes &#38; Hynes-Berry, 1986).</P>

Instead, these childrenengage in HOME SCHOOLING--that is, they will pursue learning at homeor elsewhere in the community.</P><P>There is no one way to do it.  One family may begin with openingceremonies to signal the start of the daily routine and follow ascheduled curriculum.  Another family may opt for child-led learning,where parents provide help as the child expresses interest in a topic. Usually parents provide supervision and help, but most childrenassume increasing responsibility for choosing and carrying outprojects as they mature.</P><P>Most families involved in home schooling organize activities withother families.  Some children spend part of their time at a localpublic or private school, or a nearby college.</P><a name=""></a><H3>What Are the Origins of Home Schooling?</H3><P>Schooling at home was a necessity in an age when there were a limitednumber of schools.  After schools became universally available, sometraditional groups, including the Seventh Day Adventists and Mormons,still elected to keep their younger school-aged children at home.  TheAmish kept their older children out of public schools, preferring totrain them through life in the community.</P><P>In the 1970s, other families opted for home schooling, despite easyaccess to schools.  In the early stages of this contemporary movement,most were pursuing a philosophy of child-led learning, as articulatedby writers and educators such as John Holt.  Later, many families withstrong religious convictions also turned to home schooling.</P><H3>How Many Children Are Home Schooled Today?</H3><P>On any given day, roughly half a million school-aged children areprobably learning outside of a school classroom.  They make up about 1percent of the total school-aged population and almost 10 percent ofthe privately schooled population.  This estimate assumes modestgrowth since the fall of 1990, when data were collected from threeindependent sources--those state education agencies (SEAs) that havedata; distributors of popular curricular packages; and memberships ofsupportive associations.  Since each source represents the tip of aniceberg, upward adjustments were made based on surveys ofhome-schooling groups (Patricia Lines 1991).</P><P>Because many children are home schooled for only a few years, thepercentage of children who reach age 18 with some home-schoolingexperience will be larger than 1 percent.   Until a well-designedhousehold survey is conducted, however, it will be extremely difficultto estimate this percentage.</P><P>To estimate the number of children engaged in home schooling withinits borders, a state could begin with its own database, if it has one,then supplement it with surveys to assess how many families filereports or other papers required of home schoolers. States cannotassume 100 percent compliance with filing requirements. If a statedoes not collect data, an assessment of families who are members ofstate and regional associations could serve as a starting point.</P><H3>Is Home Schooling Legal and Constitutional?</H3><P>Today all state compulsory-education laws explicitly make homeschooling a valid option, or the state interprets compulsoryschool-attendance laws to include "attendance" at a "school" locatedat home.  States have also liberalized requirements for the hometeacher.  For example, parents do not need teaching certificates, andonly Michigan requires the involvement of a certified teacher.  Evenin Michigan, however, court decisions have restricted the scope ofthis requirement.</P><P>With very few exceptions, all states require families to file basicinformation with either the state or local education agency (SEA orLEA).  Many states have additional requirements, such as thesubmission of a curricular plan, testing of students, or, lessfrequently, education or testing requirements for parents.</P><P>In the past two decades, some states have charged parents withviolating compulsory-education laws.  Parents have responded withlawsuits asserting a constitutional right to direct the education oftheir children.  Some courts have stricken compulsory-education lawsfor being too vague or have found that more restrictive regulationsexceeded the state education agency's statutory authority.  Othercourts have allowed prosecution of parents when their educationalprogram does not meet state requirements.</P><P>The United States Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled on homeschooling, but it did rule against compulsory school requirements inWISCONSIN V. YODER (1972), a limited decision involving the Amish. More generally, it has also upheld the right of parents to direct theeducation of their children.</P><H3>What Resources Are Available To Home Schoolers?</H3><P>Other like-minded families constitute a major resource for homeschoolers. Local support groups form whenever there are more than ahandful of families pursuing home schooling in a particular locale. There is at least one state-level association in every state, and insome states there are a dozen or more regional associations.</P><P>Other resources include libraries, museums, colleges, extensioncourses, parks departments, churches, local businesses, mentors,private schools, and, in some states, public schools. Books and othereducational materials are also important.  Many private educationalinstitutions offer curricular packages, books, and other materials foruse in home schooling.</P><P>Several states have innovative learning options.  In Alaska, teachersin Juneau work with students located all over the state, staying intouch by mail, telephone, and through occasional home visits.  InCalifornia, children can enroll in an independent-study programthrough a public school then base their studies in the home. Washington and Iowa require public schools to enroll children on apart-time basis if they apply.</P><P>Some districts have organized education centers where families mayobtain resources, find instructional support, and/or sign up forscheduled classes.  Other states or districts also allow part-timeenrollment, "shared schooling," "dual enrollment," or similar forms ofpart-time school attendance.</P><H3>How Well Do Home-Schooled Children Perform?</H3><P>People disagree on whether home schooling is advantageousacademically.  Research has not determined whether the SAME childrenwould perform better or worse in a public or private classroom, or ina home-schooling arrangement.  Analyses of test scores are available,based on data from states that require testing or from home-schoolingassociations.  Data from both sources may not be representative ofhome schoolers as a whole, however, because not all families cooperatewith state testing requirements and private efforts rely onvolunteers.  Keeping these caveats in mind, virtually all theavailable data show that the group of home-schooled children who aretested is above average. The pattern for children for whom data areavailable resembles that of children in private schools.</P><P>People also disagree about whether home schooling helps or hinders achild's social development. Children engaged in home schooling spendless time with same-aged children and more time with people ofdifferent ages.  Most spend time with other children through supportand networking groups, scouting, churches, and other associations. Many spend time with adults other than their parents through communityvolunteer work, running their own businesses, tutoring or mentoringarrangements, or other activities.</P><P>There is no conclusive research suggesting that additional time withsame-aged peers is preferable to more time with individuals of varyingages.  Limited testing of a self-selected group of home-schooledchildren suggested above-average social and psychological development.</P><H3>How Do Public Educators, Policy-Makers, and the Public View Home Schooling?</H3><P>The practice of home schooling is controversial.  The nationalParent-Teacher Association opposes the practice; in 1988, the NationalEducation Association adopted a resolution calling for more rigorousregulation of home schooling.  And the National Association ofElementary School Principals has maintained that education is "mosteffectively done through cohesive organizations in formal settings."  Since 1983, it has condemned home-schooling in its platform.</P><P>Other groups, such as the national American Civil Liberties Union,maintain that parents have a constitutional right to educate theirchildren at home.  Although they didn't necessarily approve of homeschooling, a majority of Americans responding to a Gallup pollnonetheless said parents have a right to engage in home schooling. State legislatures agree, and many have amended their laws to providegreater flexibility for home schooling.</P><P>Patricia Lines is a Senior Research Analyst with the NationalInstitute on Educational Governance, Finance, Policy-Making, andManagement, OERI.</P><P>An expanded version of this ERIC digest is available in P. Lines,"Homeschooling," in Private Education and Educational Choice, editedby James G. Cibulka Greenwood Press, forthcoming.

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), The Lane Company of
Altavista, Va., is announcing a voluntary program to replace
the locks on cedar chests manufactured prior to 1987. The
Lane Company manufactured approximately 12 million cedar
chests from 1912 to 1987 that latch automatically when the
lid is closed. Young children playing in the chest can
become trapped inside and suffocate.</P>
<P>     Between 1977 and 1994, six children suffocated inside
Lane cedar chests manufactured with an old design lock. The
victims ranged in age from 21 months to ten years
old.</P>
<P>     Consumers can determine whether their chest has an old
lock by closing the chest lid without depressing the locking
button and then attempting to open the lid without touching
the button. If the lid opens, the chest has the new lock and
does not need to be replaced. If the lid does not open, it
has the old lock. Additionally, old locks click loudly when
the lid is shut, locking the chest automatically.</P>
<P>     Furniture stores sold the chests nationwide in a
variety of styles, sizes, and colors between 1912 and 1987.
Some of the chests may have been handed down through
families.  By 1987, The Lane Company began manufacturing all
of its cedar chests with redesigned locks, which do not need
to be replaced.</P>
<P>     Consumers who own Lane cedar chests with old locks
should call The Lane Company toll-free at (888) 856-8758 for
free, redesigned, easy to install safety locks. Lane will
make special arrangements for consumers who need additional
help installing the locks.</P>
   

<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death from
15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on
CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800)
638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To
order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301)
504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the
release number.  Consumers can obtain this release

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
(CPSC) announced today that it has accepted a $725,000 civil
penalty from Cosco Inc. of Columbus, Ind., to settle cases
involving the failure to report serious safety hazards
presented by the company's toddler beds and guardrails. In
two lawsuits in federal court in Indianapolis, CPSC and the
U.S. Department of Justice charged the juvenile products
manufacturer with failing to report dozens of incidents of
children becoming trapped in the headboards or footboards of
its toddler beds, or in guardrails sold with the beds and
separately.  These products have been recalled and
redesigned to correct the safety hazards. </p>
 
<P>     Under the Consumer Product Safety Act, companies are
required to report to CPSC products having a defect that
could create a substantial risk of injury to the public.
Spaces in the headboards and footboards of the Cosco toddler
beds, and spaces created by Cosco guardrails used with the
beds, were large enough for part of a child's body to pass
through but small enough to create a strangulation hazard
for the child. </P>
<P>     "We will go to court whenever necessary to enforce laws
that keep our children safe.  Companies that make children's
products have a special responsibility to assure product
safety," said CPSC Chairman Ann Brown.</P>
<P>     Cosco denied that it acted improperly, but has
represented that it will take steps to assure that it meets
its reporting obligations in the future. Chairman Brown said
"we welcome Cosco's commitment to report safety issues to
CPSC." </P>
<P>     The settlement, one of the highest in the commission's
23-year history, also resolves allegations that Cosco failed
to report a safety hazard associated with one of its crib
models.  The CPSC was investigating a possible case
involving crib slats that could disengage from the
crib side rails. Missing crib slats in any crib present a
serious risk to infants who could strangle in an opening
that is larger than 2 and three-eights inches wide (roughly
the diameter of a soda can) or fall out of the crib. The
crib model involved has been recalled and redesigned to
correct these safety hazards.</P>
<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death from
15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on
CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800)
638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To
order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301)

release number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall
information at CPSC's web site at <A HREF="http://www.cpsc.gov">http://www.cpsc.gov</A> or via

Add work pressures, a committee chairmanship, and household responsibilitiesto it, and major stress can take over,&quot; Ahlgrimm points out. </P> <P> &quot;Since women are still the primary caregivers in the family, they are affected most, Ahlgrimmsaid. &quot;Women are prone to not consider their own needs and desires when others are beckoning,and while it may seem easier just to give in to others' requests, it is not better. </P> <P> &quot;Time and stress management are basic building blocks of overall good health,&quot; statesAhlgrimm. To help women who are struggling with the demands of a hectic life, Women's Health Americaoffers the following suggestions: </P> <UL> 	<LI>Wait before committing yourself to anything. Give yourself time to determine what you canmanage. It's fine to say that you need to check your schedule or your budget first. Then let thefamily member, friend or colleague know that you'll get back to them with an answer.   	<LI>Get comfortable with the word &quot;no.&quot; If you can't meet the request, be honest,straightforward, and give the reason why. Learning to be assertive about the use of your time canincrease your level of self confidence in other areas of your life.   	<LI>Set priorities for yourself. Define what you would like to accomplish in the next threemonths, and block out the necessary time for it. Include extra pleasures -- like reading that newnovel you've heard so much about.   	<LI>Schedule a fun exercise activity into your fall routine, just as if it were a meeting youwere required to attend. Exercise promotes wellness and reduces stress. Don't discount the benefitsof your active life, either. Just running up and down stairs is great for your body.   	<LI>Take the team approach to family living. Rather than doing it all yourself, enlist the helpand counsel of family members. Have them come up with healthy snacks to have on hand. Or ask theiradvice on how to handle some problem. Let family members have some ownership in coordinating theflurry of family life, and they'll be more willing participants; it's great for teaching initiativeand building self worth.   	<LI>Enjoy this special time. You don't have to be perfect. It's better to smile, relax, and letthe dust settle. Too many parents forget the rich rewards of just having fun with their kids. </UL> <P> For more information, call the toll-free 24-hour Women's Health America Group hot line at800-222-4767.

After inhaling the gas at aparty, the boy became unconscious, and had a seizure for ten minutes. When emergency physicians sawthe boy in the emergency department, they discovered that he had suffered a cerebral gas embolism --a temporary stroke caused by air bubbles in the blood stream -- in addition to lung damage caused byrapid, uncontrolled lung expansion. </P> <P> &quot;Normally, inhaling helium from balloons doesn't cause problems,&quot; says Bing Pao, MD, thestudy's main author. &quot;But inhaling anything from a pressurized tank not meant to be used onpeople can be potentially lethal.&quot; </P> <P> After diagnosis, the boy was transferred to a hyperbaric chamber at the University of California atSan Diego. The boy spent several sessions in the chamber -- a pressurized room generally used to helpunderwater divers decompress -- and completely recovered. </P> <P> Over the years, children and adults have inhaled helium from balloons to produce high, cartoon-likevoices. However, only recently have pressurized helium tanks become readily available to the general public for use at parties. </P> <P> &quot;This is the first case, as far as we know, of anyone suffering a cerebral gas embolism frominhaling helium,&quot; Dr. Pao notes.

Nowadays,kids are involved in more sedate activities, like browsing the Web or channel surfing the TV, as waysto pass the dog days of summer. With school bells ringing once again, however, kids need to beinvolved in more active pastimes than dodging detention. </P> <P> The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) is urging children of all ages to show their schoolspirit by joining a team sport -- not only for its exercise benefits, but to develop healthy habitsthat will continue throughout their lives. </P> <P> For many children, team sports like field hockey, soccer, and basketball enable them to stayphysically active on a regular basis. The current trend of adolescents toward a more sedentarylifestyle could contribute to such future health problems as heart disease. And there arepsychological as well as physical benefits to keeping fit. Building self-esteem and camaraderie anddeveloping problem-solving skills in a team setting are a few of the bonuses kids receive throughteam sports. </P> <P><H4>Starting At An Early Age </H4></P> <P> Parents play a vital role in teaching kids, especially young children, about the importance ofregular physical activity. According to the recent U.S. Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activityand Health, half of all kids between 12 and 21 are not physically active on a regular basis, anddaily enrollment in physical education classes has declined an astonishing 41% among high schoolstudents in the last five years. Team sports can combat the downward spiral of an increasingpopulation of inactive kids. </P> <P> &quot;Parents need to encourage young kids to participate in sports,&quot; says physical therapistLisa Jesberg, M.P.T., at the Atlanta Sports Medicine Center in Virginia Beach, Va. &quot;However,when introducing them to team sports, parents should de-emphasize competition and emphasize havingfun. If their first sports experience is positive, kids are more likely to pursue other physicalactivities throughout life. And if the first exposure is negative, they may end up choosing asedentary lifestyle instead.&quot; </P> <P><H4>Getting The Ball Rolling </H4></P> <P> Before &quot;Junior&quot; takes to the field, parents should consider a few things. First, yourchild should have a physical exam before playing any sport to make sure there are no conditions thatwould preclude participation. Second, if your child has spent the summer as a couch potato or lacksphysical conditioning, inform the coach. Coaches should develop training programs for their playersthat are tailored to the sport, the age group and the physical levels of the children. Questionsregarding physical conditioning programs can be directed to your local physical therapist. Finally,you can help keep children physically conditioned by encouraging them to remain active year round,not just during the sports season. </P> <P>&quot; My family played a big role in introducing me to team sports,&quot; says Laurel Martin, amember of the 1996 U.S. Women's Olympic Field Hockey Team and coach for women's field hockey at CapeHenry Collegiate in Virginia Beach, Va. &quot;I've always been excited about participating in sports,but they provided the extra encouragement. Now, I try to pass that knowledge to my players and theirparents, so that they can play to their potential, as well as continue with healthy habits well afterthe season is over.&quot; </P> <P><H4>Getting In Shape </H4></P> <P> To fully enjoy a season of sports, kids need to properly condition themselves. Performingextracurricular physical activities such as bicycling or raking leaves can help kids to keep theirmuscles limber before donning a team uniform. Good warm-up and cool-down sessions also help growingmuscles avoid injury and strain. </P> <P> Sometimes, however, injury does occur. &quot;Parents should remember that children are not smalladults,&quot; explains Lisa Jesberg, M.P.T. &quot;Because kids are more susceptible to injury, whatmight appear as a sprain in adults could be a fracture in a child's growth plate.&quot; No matter howsmall the sports injury, children should be checked out thoroughly by a physical therapist orphysician. </P> <P> APTA offers an activity book called &quot;Fit Kids&quot; that helps children learn about physicalfitness through puzzles, cartoons, and stories. &quot;Fit Teens,&quot; a magazine with fitness tipsand interviews with famous teen sports figures, is also available. For a free copy of either, writeto APTA, P.O. Box 37257, Washington, DC, 20013. </P> <P> The American Physical Therapy Association is a national professional organization representing morethan 70,000 physical therapists, physical therapist assistants, and students. Its goal is to fosterimprovements in physical therapy education, practice, and research to enable provision of the highestquality physical therapy care to consumers. </P> <P>SOURCE The American Physical Therapy Association </P> <P> CONTACT: Karen Pascual of Brouillard Communications, 212-210-8625; or Alexis Waters of APTA,703-706-3215 </P></td></tr></table><hr><center><h4><a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> |<a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |<A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |<a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center><img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left><address>We love to talk with you.

The first phase centered on the need for"computer literacy," generally defined as computer awareness andcomputer programming. At the height of the computer literacy debate,emphasis shifted to the role of the computer as a tool, and as amethod for teaching problem solving. Most recently, attention amongeducators has turned to yet a third phase. This third phase addressesissues related to computer applications in support of the curriculum.<p></P><P>Research studies (Reinking, 1988) indicate clearly that computerinstruction is effective for a wide variety of reading skill andconcept areas. The level of popularity of computer-based instructionin reading may vary, but few will dispute the fact that computers havewon a permanent place in most classrooms. The most common concerns ofeducators now have to do with the effectiveness of computer-basededucation, and with the appropriateness of the many possible rolescomputers can play in language arts instruction.<p></P><P>The emphasis should not be on using computers to increase reading andwriting achievement, but rather on whether teachers use computers formeaningful reading and writing instruction, or are locked intocomputer-based drill and practice software. This digest will focus onhow teachers can integrate computers into reading/writing instruction.<p></P><P>The following guidelines may also be used as a checklist to helpteachers of the language arts match their use of computers with whatis known about the reading/writing process. We hope that the checklistwill be used in a context where students are given opportunities towork in all the various computer modes: tool, tutor, and tutee.</P><a name="Guidelines"></a><H3>Guidelines For Computers and Reading</H3><OL Type= numeric><LI> Computer instruction in reading should focus on meaning and stressreading comprehension.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to work with whole, meaningfultexts. Programs that offer learners a chance to process large chunksof related text, rather than bits and pieces of unrelated languagefragments, allow students to use and extend what they know aboutreading comprehension.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to work with word-recognitionprograms that stress the use of word meanings in conjunction withphonics and structural analysis. Care must be taken to make sure that,when programs feature the study of individual words and phrases, theyare offered within a contextual framework that help them make sense tothe learner. Assessment programs for teachers should also be providedin meaningful context.<BR><BR>*Learners should have the opportunities to apply the skills beingtaught in some meaningful way. Programs that deny the learner anopportunity to make use of what is being "taught" are merelyassessment tools and do little to further the learner's growth.<BR><BR>*Learners should have the opportunity to work with computer materialsthat use content and language that are within the range of theirconceptual development. Tasks should be challenging but notfrustrating. Student interests, previous experiences, and purpose playa role in determining whether or not a computer task is comprehensibleand worthwhile.<BR><BR><LI> Computer instruction in reading should foster active involvementand stimulate thinking.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to discuss the purpose of thecomputer task or program as well as its nature. They should be awarenot only of what they are supposed to do but also of why doing it isimportant.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to make decisions that control orinfluence the computer task. Programs that build in opportunities forstudents to make choices and test predictions help them learn to thinkand act on their own rather than merely react to someone else'sthinking.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to monitor their own learning.Tasks that offer students opportunities to self-check and correcttheir own errors support the development of independent learners.<BR><BR><LI> Computer instruction in reading should support and extend students'knowledge of text structures.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to encounter a wide variety oftext structures upon which to apply and refine their comprehensionskill. A variety of narrative and expository structures should beprovided. Commercially prepared, teacher-authored, andstudent-authored materials should also be included.

<P>All cultures need role models and leaders. Most of us agree that
professions such as medicine, technology, education, business and
industry, politics, and the arts need people who can use intelligence,
creativity, and critical judgment. The role of parents and educators
is critical in assisting with the development of leadership attitudes
and skills in gifted youth.</P>

<P>Leadership has been designated a talent area in federal and state
definitions of gifted students who require differentiated programs,
yet it remains the least discussed of the curricular areas for these
students in the literature, and it is not well defined.</P>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
<H3>Characteristics of Leadership In Gifted Youth</H3>

<P>Few gifted programs identify students with high leadership potential
or incorporate leadership education into their curricula. However,
many characteristics of gifted youth enable them to profit from
leadership development. Those characteristics include the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The desire to be challenged.

<LI>The ability to solve problems creatively.

<LI>The ability to reason critically.

<LI>The ability to see new relationships.

<LI>Facility of verbal expression.

<LI>Flexibility in thought and action.

<LI>The ability to tolerate ambiguity.

<LI>The ability to motivate others.<BR><BR>

<a name="Parents"></a>
<H3>Parents and the Development of Leadership</H3>

<P>Preparing young people for leadership responsibility begins in the
home with an enriched environment that offers opportunities for
children to acquire broad interests, self-esteem, and the insights and
skills that characterize leaders. Parents can provide their children
with support and encouragement as they participate in a wide variety
of home and community activities. Parents should encourage their
children to be involved in the selection, planning, execution, and
evaluation of family activities ranging from a day at the zoo to a
vacation overseas. Youngsters should also be encouraged to plan,
initiate, and complete a variety of self-evaluated individual
projects, but these skills are not learned automatically. They must be
patiently taught and modeled by parents in the home.</P>

<P>Discussion and debate about current events and other topics foster
independent thinking and nurture leadership potential. Parents who
listen openly and thoughtfully without expecting children to embrace
their social, political, and economic views are demonstrating
leadership characteristics. Mutual respect, objectivity, empathy, and
understanding are highly valued by gifted young people, particularly
those who need a safe place to test their ideas.</P>

<P>Opportunities for decision making at an early age will help to foster
the critical reasoning skills necessary to be an effective leader.
Inappropriate decisions by children and youth, although difficult for
parents to accept, may enhance future decision-making skills when
self-evaluated.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Infusing"></a>
<H3>Infusing Leadership Concepts and Skills Into the Curriculum</H3>

<P>Major emphasis should be placed on leadership development in all
academic areas, including the fine and performing arts. Thematic
curriculum units and reading lists should include biographies and
autobiographies of outstanding leaders. Students should be encouraged
to analyze and evaluate the motivation, contributions, and influences
of each leader and assess the leadership styles employed. Major events
and family and other influences important in the life of each leader
should be emphasized.</P>

<P><B>Sciences</B>. Physical and biological sciences, mathematics, and social
sciences provide unique opportunities for projects in which
initiating, planning, critical thinking, creative problem solving, and
decision making can be developed. They  are rich with opportunities to
learn about leaders who have influenced such areas as government and
politics, science and technology, humanities and the arts, business
and industry, philosophy and religion, and health science and
medicine. Students can learn how their interests, passions, and
abilities can develop into careers. They can compare the contributions
of others with their own value systems. For example, many leaders have
been concerned about poverty and the human condition.</P>

<P><B>Humanities</B>. Language arts, speech, English, and other courses that
emphasize oral and written communication provide opportunities for
potential leaders to learn how to present ideas clearly and
persuasively. Preparing and presenting speeches, listening to and
critiquing presentations, writing news reports and editorials for
school and other local publications, preparing for and engaging in
debates, leading conference and discussion sessions, and participating
in school and other election campaigns are only a few of the many
options available. Group activities provide opportunities for young
people to learn how to help others feel important and valued, accept
their contributions, keep discussions relevant, and occasionally
follow rather than lead.</P>

<P><B>Arts</B>. Students can learn leadership skills and gain inspiration from
talented people of the past and present who have enriched all of us
through their contributions in the fine and performing arts. Their
creative works, the trends they initiated, and the enduring results of
their efforts are worthy of study, as are their lives and the
circumstances under which their work came to fruition.</P>

<a name="Other"></a>
<H3>Other School Options For Leadership Development</H3>

<P>Several strategies strengthen and broaden educational experiences for
gifted youth. Instructional units on leadership development should be
provided at each grade level in a resource room or pullout
administrative arrangement. Some secondary schools offer structured
credit courses on leadership. Having students prepare and periodically
update personal plans for leadership development, including provisions
for obtaining the experiences set forth in their plans, is another
promising activity. The value of this experience is enhanced when
students share individual plans in group sessions, brief the group on
their purpose, revise plans if the critique brings forth acceptable
suggestions, report to peers on progress made after following the
plans for a period of time, and evaluate the plans using self-designed
criteria.</P>

<P>Mentorships and internship programs provide opportunities for youth to
work with adult community leaders who are willing to help identify,
develop, and nurture future leaders.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Leadership"></a>
<H3>Leadership Through Extracurricular Activities</H3>

<P>Since leadership is learned over time through involvement with others,
extracurricular activities provide fertile ground for nurturing future
leaders. Group participation offers unique opportunities for young
people to belong, support others, and learn a variety of leadership
styles. Students learn how to encourage others, create group spirit,
and resolve conflict. They begin to understand diverse attitudes,
skills, and talents and how to interact effectively with a diversity
of people while working toward a common goal.</P>

<P>Leadership in extracurricular activities has been found to be more
highly correlated with adult leadership than with academic
achievement. A 10-year study conducted with 515 high school student
leaders revealed that almost two-thirds of them participated in
out-of-school organizations and athletics and more than half
participated in fine arts activities.</P>

<P>Although there are many organized extracurricular activities for
youth, those who want to develop their leadership potential can do so
through less formal methods. Individuals or groups can plan special
projects or a leadership plan by setting goals, objectives, and
timelines toward a mission of improving some area of the school or
community. Skills such as seeking all available information, defining
a group task, and devising a workable plan may be developed through
any community project. No matter how small or large the goal, the
process involved in devising and implementing the plan develops
leadership potential.</P>

<P>Leadership is much more than being elected or appointed to a position,
and it is acquired most effectively through practice. Educators,
parents, and other concerned adults who are interested in the
development of leadership in gifted youth can make a difference in the
lives of these students by providing them with opportunities to
realize their leadership potential.</P>

<a name="Statement"></a>

<P>Twenty-five years after the baby boom generation set a national
record for school enrollment at 51.3 million students, the record
is about to be broken.  It is fitting that the children of the baby
boomers are doing the record breaking.</P>

<P>With 51.7 million children going to school this fall -- a new
national record -- we have a lot of children in our schools
striving for excellence.  Demographers call this phenomenon the
baby boom echo.  This special back-to-school report seeks to
describe the many aspects of this baby boom echo and its
implications for education.</P>

<P>One thing is clear: With so many young people coming of age and
needing a quality education to prepare for the future, America will
surely be tested on whether we will invest in time, energy and
resources so that these children and this nation can look to the
future with confidence.</P>

<P>Some will certainly look at this rising wave of students as a
liability, but in the long run they are a tremendous asset to our
nation -- if we educate them well.  If we commit now to giving
these young people a first-class education, we can assure ourselves
that they will grow up to be independent, self-sufficient, and
responsible citizens.  Equally important for baby boomers now
starting to contemplate their retirement, these young people
represent the work force of  tomorrow -- the very people who will
be working to support the baby boomers in retirement.</P>

<P>The facts of the baby boom echo speak for themselves.  The 1996-97
school year represents only the mid-point of a 20-year trend of
rising school enrollments.  By the year 2006, America's schools
will have to educate 54.6 million children -- almost 3 million more
than today.</P>

<P>Four key factors account for rising enrollments.  The most
significant factor, accounting for half of the current growth rate,
is a delay in marriage and child-bearing among baby boomers.  A
high birth rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and
other minorities is a second important reason why enrollment is on
the rise.
</P> 
<P>Increased immigration represents a third factor.  School systems in
America's gateway cities, including New York, Los Angeles and
Miami, have been the first to feel the direct impact of new
immigration patterns.  A fourth trend is that larger numbers of
children are enrolled in pre-K and kindergarten and more young
people are staying in school to get their high school diplomas.  In
1995, 37 percent of 3-year-olds, 61 percent of 4-year-olds, and 90
percent of 5-year-olds were enrolled in center-based programs or
kindergarten.  Overall, the dropout rate for 16-to-24-year-olds has
declined from 14 percent in 1982 to 12 percent in 1994.</P>

<P>What makes this growth trend different from the surge in the late
1960s is that this current growth trend is a long, slow, rising
wave, and we see no immediate fall-off.  Educators faced with
rising enrollment in the 1960s could anticipate a sharp decline in
the need to build schools in the 1970s.  Many schools districts,
therefore, met the demand for schooling by using portable
classrooms and/or going to double sessions.  Today, some school
districts are already using many of these stop-gap strategies,
which may not be sufficient to accommodate the continued growth in
the years ahead.</P>

<P>Much of the growth is in the Far West and the Southeast.  In all,
33 states face rising enrollments while 17 states and the District
of Columbia will see a decline in their overall student population. 
School enrollment will increase by 14 percent in the West and 6.3
percent in the South, while the school-age population in the North
and the Midwest remains basically stable.</P>

<P>California, the state that often leads America into the future, is
the epicenter of school enrollment pressures.  In 1996, a total of
5.8 million children will answer school bells all over California.
Ten years from now, 6.9 million children will be attending schools
in California, an 18.3 percent increase for a total of 1,063,000
students.  Other states facing sharply escalating enrollments
include Texas, Washington, Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, and
New Jersey.  The District of Columbia, North Dakota and Maine will
see the sharpest fall-off in overall student population.</P>

<P>America's elementary and secondary schools will also become more
diverse in the next 10 years.  Between 1995 and the year 2005, for
example, Hispanic-Americans between the ages of 5 and 17 will
increase by 2.4 million.  African-Americans in this same age group
will increase by 1.1 million.  Asian-Americans  and other
minorities will number an additional 1.1 million.  In contrast, the
White non-Hispanic student population will grow more slowly,
increasing by only 500,000 over the same 10-year span.</P>

<P>Much of the pressure to build schools is occurring in suburban
areas as a result of out-migration from cities and the number of
young people who now make up the baby boom echo.  "Between 1985 and
1990, 103 million Americans moved," said Harold L. Hodgkinson, a
demographer with the Institute for Educational Leadership.  "During
the 1980s, we left small towns, rural areas, and center cities and
moved to the suburbs, where over half of Americans now live."  As a
result, many suburban school systems have been pushed to the limit
to meet rising enrollments.  In suburban Atlanta, Gwinnett County
Public Schools Superintendent Alvin Wilbanks said, "Gwinnett County
has to build three new classrooms every week for the rest of the
decade."</P>

<P>A current feature of the baby boom echo is well worth noting -- a
significant number of  the young people who make-up the baby boom
echo are approaching their teen years and they will soon be filling
up our nation's high schools.  In the next 10 years, public high
school enrollment is expected to increase by 15 percent. 
California, for example, will have to find seats for an additional
525,000 high school students.  Other states that will see
significant increase in  high school enrollments include Virginia
(25.4 percent), North Carolina (24.9 percent), New Jersey (24.9
percent) and Maryland (24.6 percent).  Six states -- Arizona,
Nevada, New Mexico, New Hampshire,  Florida, and Maryland -- will
see an increase of 30 percent or more  in the number of high school
graduates.
</P> 
<P>What are we to make of all this growth and the implications that
educators and policy makers need to think through?  </P>

<P>For many parents the foremost issue is the size of their children's
schools and whether their children get the needed individual
attention.  In 1992-1993 the average elementary school had 464
students and the average secondary school had 689 students.  School
districts in many high-growth areas will be hard pressed to meet
this average.  A recent study by the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, titled Breaking Ranks: Changing an
American Institution, suggests that our nation's schools become
more "personalized."  It recommends organizing schools into "units
of no more than 600 students so that teachers and students can get
to know each other better."  </P>

<P>Class size is a persistent issue, and it will be even more so in
the coming years.  In 1993-94 the national average for class size
was 25.2 students in elementary schools and 23.2 for secondary
schools.  Many of the states that already have large schools and
crowded classrooms will be the states that continue to have
significant enrollment increases.  In the next 10 years, more than
6,000 new schools must be built to accommodate the children who
make up the baby boom echo.  Many local school boards, therefore,
will face the task of finding the resources to build new schools
and recruit additional well-trained teachers to keep class size
down. </P>

<P>In addition, many school districts are already renovating and
updating school buildings to meet the demand to get new
technologies into the classroom.  Modernizing schools and investing
in technology will also require additional financial resources. 
Florida, for example, has spent $75 million modernizing 322 schools
over the last three years.  As we have seen most recently with
California's Net Day, the American people are eager to invest in
their children's future and ingenious and inexpensive ways can be
found to get the job done.</P>

<P>As we move into this new Information Age, America must have a high
quality teaching force that can excite and energize all of our
young people.  We estimate that America's schools will need an
additional 190,000 teachers in the next 10 years.  Some former
teachers who are re-entering the profession to meet this new demand
will have to brush up on their skills to teach to new high
standards.  Our colleges that prepare teachers must ensure that
their graduates are ready to teach to these new high standards and
to use new technologies as effective teaching tools. </P>

<P>Teachers must also learn new ways to involve parents in the
learning process.  Thirty years of research tells us that the
starting point of putting children on the road to excellence is
parental involvement in their children's education.  The American
family is the rock on which a solid education can and must be
built.  Yet, too often parents remain the missing link in the
education equation in too many schools and for too many students.</P>

<P>On another front, the rising tide of high school students suggests
that there may be greater competition to gain admission to our
nation's colleges and universities in a few short years.  America's
young people know the value of a good college education and many
more of them expect to get a college education.  Now is the time
for parents of middle school and junior high students to sit down
with their children and chart a course that will prepare those
youngsters for a college education.</P>

<P>By the year 2006 college enrollments will climb to 16.4 million, an
increase of 14 percent from 1996, adding two million more students
to college rolls.  California's system of public higher education 
is already under great pressure to accommodate the rising demand
for a college education.</P>

<P>Finding ways to finance the college education of all of these young
people should be very high on our national agenda in the immediate
future.  In my opinion, no high school student who works hard to
make the grade should be denied the opportunity to get a college
education because he or she cannot afford to go to college.  Access
to higher education has been part of our national purpose for well
over 50 years and we cannot close this door of opportunity.</P>

<P>Another factor of consequence: Many more of our young people are
now living in poverty.  In 1970, near the peak of the last
enrollment high, the number of young people living in poverty
barely exceeded 10 million.  In 1995, the number of young people
who were struggling reached 15.7 million.  The sheer drag of
poverty can deter even the brightest young person.  As a nation, we
need to get our priorities straight.  Changing our expectations of
what poor and disadvantaged children can achieve is central to
helping them to learn their way out of poverty.  The era of dumbing
down American education is over, and nothing will be gained by
continuing to give some young people living in poverty a watered-
down curriculum.</P>

<P>Many of the young people who make up this baby boom echo are
entering their teen years, struggling with all the many ups and
downs that are a part of adolescence and coming of age.  We can
take their education for granted and allow these young people to
drift through school, shaped by peer pressure and the pop culture
that surrounds them.  Or we can look to the future and recognize
that now is the time to mold their character, teach them basic
American values, help them to become good citizens, and give them
an education of high quality.  To my way of thinking, there is no
more important task for this nation in this post-Cold War era than
helping American families in the education of their children. </P>

<P>America's task is to mobilize all of our citizens and resources to
give all of our young people the education they deserve.  We must
make sure that they learn how to read and learn the core academic
subjects to high standards; that they go to schools that are havens
of order and safety; that we set the highest standards for our
teaching profession; that we make sure that every school in this
nation offers students access to computers and the Internet; and
that we keep open wide the doors of opportunity that lead to a
higher education.  </P>

<P>Above all, we must recognize that our schools cannot do it alone.
Every part of the broader American community must pull together to
give all of our young people the opportunity to gain an education
of high quality.  The success and freedom of being an American in
this day and age is the freedom of excellence -- the ability to be
highly educated and highly trained, to negotiate a complex economic
environment, and to become productive and responsible citizens.</P>

Protective eyewear is alsostrongly recommended for all other athletes.</P> <a name="background"></a><H4> Background</H4> <p>Over 41,000 sports-related and recreational eye injuries were treated in hospital emergencydepartments in 1993.(reference 1)  Seventy-one percent of the injuries occurred in individuals under25 years of age, 41% occurred in individuals under 15 years of age, and 6% occurred in children under5 years of age. Children and adolescents are particularly susceptible to injuries because of theirfearless manner of play and their athletic immaturity. (references 2-4)</P><p>Ten sports or sports groupings are highlighted in this statement based on their popularity and thehigh incidence of eye injuries (see Table 1).(reference 1) Baseball and basketball are associatedwith the most eye injuries in athletes 5 to 24 years old.(reference 5)  Participation rates andinformation on the severity of the injuries are unavailable, however, and so the relative risk ofsignificant injuries cannot be determined for various sports.</P><p>The high frequency of sports-related eye injuries in young athletes indicates the need for anawareness among athletes and their parents of the risks of participation and of the availability of avariety of approved sports eye protectors. When properly fitted, appropriate eye protectors have beenfound to reduce the risk of significant eye injury by at least 90% (references 4,6,7)</P><a name="evaluation"></a><H4>Evaluation</H4><p>It would be ideal if all children and adolescents wore appropriate eye protection for all sportsand recreational activities. All youth involved in organized sports should be encouraged to wearappropriate eye protection.</P><p>Physicians must strongly recommend that athletes who are functionally one-eyed wear appropriate eyeprotection during all sports and recreational activities. (Functionally one-eyed athletes are thosewith a best corrected visual acuity of worse than 20/40 in the poorer-seeing eye, assuming thatadequate amblyopia [lazy eye] therapy has been accomplished). (references 4,5,8) </P>If the better eye is severely injured, functionally monocular athletes will be severely handicapped.In many states, they could not obtain a driver's license. (reference 9) </P><p>Athletes who have had eye surgery or trauma to the eye may have weakened eye tissue that is moresusceptible to injury. (reference 10) These athletes may need eye protection and should be evaluatedand counseled by an ophthalmologist.</P><p>Various kinds of eye protection are described below and in the Glossary. Different brands of sportsgoggles vary significantly in the way they fit. An experienced ophthalmologist, optometrist, oroptician can help an athlete select appropriate goggles that fit well.</P><p>Indigent athletes may have trouble affording eye evaluations or protective eyewear. Sportsprograms may have to assist these athletes in the evaluation process and in obtaining protectiveeyewear.</P><p>*This statement has been approved by the Council on Child and Adolescent Health. The recommendationsin this policy statement do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard ofmedical care.

A strap must secure the frame to the head. These glassesmust be fitted by an experienced ophthalmologist, optometrist, or optician.</p><li><p> Appropriate protective eyewear for high-eye-risk sports is itemized in Table 2. The sportsgoggles must have lenses made of polycarbonate, which is stronger than CR-39 plastic. An experiencedophthalmologist, optometrist, or optician must fit these goggles.</P><p> Because some children have narrow facial features, they may be unable to wear even the smallestsports goggles. These children must be fitted with the approved street-wear frames described forlow-eye-risk sports.</P><p> Athletes with a high range of refractive error cannot use lenses made of polycarbonate. They maywear contact lenses (high power) protected by sports goggles with polycarbonate plano(nonprescription) lenses.</P><p> For sports in which a face mask or helmet with an eye protector or shield must be worn, westrongly recommend that functionally one-eyed athletes also wear sports goggles with polycarbonatelenses to ensure protection. The helmet must fit properly and have a chin strap for optimalprotection.</P><li> <p> Contact lenses offer no protection; therefore, we strongly recommend that athletes who wearcontact lenses also wear appropriate polycarbonate eye protection over the lenses. Polycarbonate(plano) nonprescription lenses should be used in street-wear frames for low-eye-risk sports or insports goggles for high-eye-risk sports.</P><li> <p> Athletes must replace sports eye protectors that are damaged or yellowed with age, becausethey may have become weakened.</P><li> <p> Functionally one-eyed athletes and those who have had an eye injury or surgery must notparticipate in boxing, wrestling, and full-contact martial arts. Eye protection is not practical inboxing or wrestling and is not allowed in full-contact martial arts.</P></ol><a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr><a name="Table2"></a><H3>Table 2:  Sports With High Risk of Eye Injury With Appropriate Eye Protectors </H3><table border=2><tr><th>Sport </th><th> Eye Protection</th></tr><tr> <td>Badminton </td><td>Sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses</td></tr> <tr> <td>Baseball </td><td>  Polycarbonate face guard or other certified safe protection attached to helmet for batting and base running; sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses for fielding </td></tr><tr> <td> Basketball </td><td>Sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses</td></tr> <tr> <td>Bicycling (LER)* </td><td>Sturdy street-wear frames with polycarbonate or CR-39 lenses</td></tr><tr> <td> Boxing </td><td>None is available.</td></tr><tr> <td> Fencing </td><td>Full face cage</td></tr><tr> <td> Field Hockey (both sexes ) </td><td>Goalie: full face mask; all others: sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses</td></tr><tr> <td> Football </td><td>Polycarbonate shield on helmet</td></tr><tr> <td> Full-contact martial arts </td><td>Not allowed</td></tr><tr> <td> Handball** </td><td>Sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses</td></tr><tr> <td> Ice Hockey</td><td> Helmet and full face protection</td></tr> <tr> <td>Lacrosse (male)</td><td> Helmet and full face protection required.</td></tr><tr> <td> Lacrosse (female)</td><td> Should at least wear sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses and have option towear helmet and full face protection.</td></tr><tr> <td> Racquetball** </td><td>Sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses</td></tr><tr> <td> Soccer </td><td>Sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses</td></tr><tr> <td> Softball</td><td> Polycarbonate face guard on helmet for batting and base running; sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses for fielding</td></tr><tr> <td> Squash**</td><td> Sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses</td></tr><tr> <td> Street hockey </td><td>Sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses; goalie: full face cage++</td></tr><tr> <td>Swimming and pool sports</td><td> Swim goggles recommended</td></tr><tr> <td> Tennis: doubles</td><td> Sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses</td></tr><tr> <td>Tennis: singles </td><td>Sturdy street-wear frames with polycarbonate lenses</td></tr><tr> <td>Track and field (LER)* </td><td>Sturdy street-wear frames with polycarbonate or CR-39 lenses</td></tr><tr> <td>Water polo </td><td>Swim goggles with polycarbonate lenses</td></tr><tr> <td>Wrestling </td><td>None is available. </td></tr></table><hr width=75 align=left><P> * LER = Low Eye Risk </P><P>** Goggles without lenses are not effective. </P><P>+ For sports in which a face mask or helmet with eye protector is worn, functionally one-eyedathletes, and those with previous eye trauma or surgery for whom their ophthalmologists recommend eyeprotection, must also wear sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses to ensure protection. </P> <P>++ A street hockey ball can penetrate a molded goalie mask and injure an eye.</P><a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr><a name="references"></a><H3> References </H3><ol><li> Prevent Blindness America (formerly National Society to Prevent Blindness): 1993 Sports andRecreational Eye Injuries.

<h3>Peer Acceptance And Children's Behavior</h3>

<p>Children's understanding of emotional expressions and situations has been
found to relate to how well peers like or dislike them. A study at George
Mason University suggests that well-liked children are better able than other
children to read and respond to peers' emotions. Disliked children may
misinterpret peers' emotions, leading to difficult interactions and eventual
rejection by peers.</p>

<p>In general, positive behaviors, such as cooperation, are associated with
being accepted by peers, and antisocial behaviors, such as aggression, are
associated with being rejected. This is confirmed by recent studies
identifying characteristics and behaviors related to being liked or disliked
by peers.</p>

<p>Good communication is a skill important to the continuation of social
play. Well-liked children appear to communicate better than disliked
children. In a study at the University of Texas, well-liked children were
more likely than others to be clear in direct communications by saying the
other child's name, establishing eye contact, or touching the child they
intended to address. Well-liked children more often replied appropriately to
children who spoke to them, rather than ignoring the speaker, changing the
subject, or saying something irrelevant. While well-liked children were not
any less prone to reject peers' 
communications toward them, they were more likely to offer a reason for the
rejection or suggest alternatives. For example, in rejecting a peer's
suggestion--"let's pretend we are hiding from the witch"--a well-liked child
was more likely to say, "no, we played that yesterday," or, "no, let's be
robbers instead," rather than just saying, "no."</p>

<a name="reputation"></a>
<h3>Peer Acceptance And Social Reputation</h3>

<p>It is important to recognize the role of the peer group in maintaining a
child's level of social acceptance. Once a child has established a reputation
among peers either as someone with whom it is fun to play or as someone with
whom joint play is unpleasant or dissatisfying, this reputation may influence
the way other children perceive the child's later behavior. If a negative
reputation is developed, helping the child become accepted may require more
than a change in the child's behavior; it may also be necessary to point out
to the other children when the child's behavior changes and to guide them to
respond to the child in positive ways.</p>

<h3>How Can Teachers And Other Adults Help?</h3>

<p>Studies such as those mentioned above suggest important elements to be
considered by those who wish to understand why a particular child is
unpopular and need to decide what to do to help that child gain social
acceptance. To assist a disliked child in gaining acceptance, careful,
informed observation is needed.</p>

<p>Observe behavior and note: Does the child have greater success interacting
with one or two peers than with larger groups? Does the child often seem to
misinterpret the apparent intentions and emotional cues of other children?
When rejecting a playmate's suggestion, does the child provide a reason or an
alternative idea? Do classmates consistently rebuff or ignore the child's
attempts to engage in play, even when the child is using strategies that
should work? There is no recipe for facilitating acceptance. To help a child,
it is essential to identify the child's areas of difficulty.</p>

<a name="consider"></a>
<h3>Strategies To Consider</h3>

<p>Adults who work with groups of children may feel frustrated in their
attempts to help a child achieve social acceptance. Many approaches can be
adapted to particular situations and needs of individual children. Special
play activities can be arranged, such as grouping children who lack social
skills with those who are socially competent and will thus provide examples
for learning effective skills. Planning special play sessions with a younger
child may help the socially isolated child. Research reports that socially
isolated preschoolers exposed to play sessions with pairs of younger children
eventually become more socially involved in the class than do isolated
children who play with children of their own age. The decision to pair a
child with a younger or more socially skilled child should depend on whether
the child's social isolation is due to ineffective social skills or lack of
confidence. Some children have adequate social skills, but are anxious and
inhibited about using them. Opportunities to be the big guy in play with a
 younger child may give the inhibited child a needed boost of social
confidence.</p>

<p>Sometimes disliked children behave aggressively because they don't know
how to resolve conflicts. Planned activities can help children generate
alternative solutions to difficult social situations. Skits, puppet shows, or
group discussions that present hypothetical situations can encourage a wide
range of ideas for potential solutions. Such methods can increase the number
of appropriate strategies, such as taking turns or sharing, that are
available to the children. However, to effectively implement such newly
learned strategies in the classroom, children must be given on-the-spot
guidance when real conflict situations occur. To help with conflict
resolution, the adult can encourage the children involved to voice their
perspectives, generate potential solutions, and jointly decide on and
implement a mutually acceptable solution. </p>

<p>When a child has difficulty entering ongoing play, an adult can steer the
child toward smaller or more accepting groups, or can structure the
environment to include inviting spaces for private small group or one-on-one
play. A loft, a tent, or a large empty box might make an inviting space. When
a child asks, "Can I play?" the teacher can guide the child in observing the
ongoing play, figuring out the group's 
theme and purpose, and thinking of a role to play or of ways to contribute to
the group. On-the-spot guidance by adults can facilitate communication, which
contributes to successful play. A child who rejects playmates' ideas without
offering explanations or alternatives could be told, "Ben I don't think Tom
understands why you don't want to play store. Can you tell him why?" or "Can
you tell him what else you could do together?" A disliked child having
difficulty reading others' emotional cues might be given a suggestion--"Look
at Mary's face. Do you think she likes it when you poke her?"</p>

<p>In addition to using techniques that focus on the disliked child, adults
may need to translate for the peer group the unpopular child's behavior and
apparent intentions. For example, an adult might say, Thomas wants to play
with you. If you don't need another father, who could he be instead?"
However, when intervention focuses on the peer group, adults should not force
peers to play with a disliked child. This may cause resentment and increase
rejection of the child.</p>

<p>The teacher's attempts to help a disliked child find a comfortable niche
in the peer group may prove more successful if the child's family is
involved, either directly or indirectly. After describing to the parent what
techniques are being tried in the classroom, the teacher may suggest how the
parent can use some of the strategies to help the child play with peers at
home or interact with siblings. Children who feel good about themselves and
experience loving family relationships may bring their expectations of
acceptance and success to the peer group. Such expectations can become
self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>

<p>For the child whose poor self-concept reflects difficulties in the child's
family, parent conferences in which the teacher can offer support may be
helpful. Literature on such topics as positive discipline and effective
parent-child interaction can be offered on a parent reading shelf or bulletin
board.  Parent discussion groups, facilitated by a knowledgeable
professional, can provide information about the importance of social
competence and guidance strategies that can help parents facilitate their
child's development.</p>

CIGNA is one ofthe largest managed dental care providers in the country, representing more than 13,000 dentists in39 states.<BR><BR> Dr. Libou offers the following suggestions to help protect your child's precious smile atschool:<BR><ul><li>Wear mouth protection. Most dental injuries could be prevented if children wore mouthguardsduring all recreational or sporting activities. It's important to keep in mind that non-contactsports, such as rollerblading, skateboarding or bike-riding, are as potentially dangerous to teeth asfootball or hockey. Mouthguards are available at sporting goods stores or your dentist can make acustom-made guard.<BR><BR><li>Be prepared if braces break. Millions of children wear braces. It's not uncommon for active kidsto have problems with their braces. Teach your child that if a wire is causing irritation in themouth, to cover the end of it with a small cotton hall or piece of gauze from the school nurse, untilyou can get the child to the dentist or orthodontist. According to Dr. Libou, if a wire gets stuck inthe cheek, tongue or gum tissue, do not attempt to remove it. He says to immediately take your childto the dentist or orthodontist.<BR><BR><li> Don't chew pencils. Many students express nervous energy at homework time by chewing on pencilsand pens. According to Dr. Libou this bad habit could chip or crack a tooth. &quot;If your child is achewer, encourage them to chew sugarless gum,&quot; suggests Dr. Libou.<BR><BR><li>An apple a day. Years ago school children used to bring their teachers apples. Today they shouldbring apples for themselves. Encourage children to eat healthy and snack on fruits and vegetablesinstead of the candy and chips in vending machines.<BR><BR><li> Visit the dentist regularly. Twice-a-year visits for professional cleanings will reduce damagingtartar buildup on teeth and help spot any dental problems. Early identification can help preventcavities and gum disease.</ul><BR><BR> &quot;When you go shopping for school supplies, don't forget to pick up an extra toothbrush andtoothpaste,&quot; says Dr. Libou. &quot;The best way to keep a healthy smile is by brushing afterevery meal -- and that includes lunch.&quot;<BR><BR>Contact: Stacey Bomser or Janet Maizner, Maizner &amp; Franklin, 954-761-8888<BR></p></td></tr></table><br><hr><center><h4> <a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |  <a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |    <a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> | <a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |    <A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |  <a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center> <img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left>   <address>We love to talk with you.

President Clintonunveiled the proposal today in a White House ceremony.<BR><BR> &quot;We hope that this plan has a smooth transition into national policy,&quot; said AAP Committeeon Substance Abuse Chairman Richard Heyman, M.O. &quot;We know that the tobacco industry, andpossibly even some members of Congress, will do anything in their power to stub out these rules.Pediatricians will oppose any attempts to block or stall their implementation.&quot;<BR><BR> The nation's pediatricians applaud President Clinton's action because they believe that restrictionson youth-targeted tobacco advertising and other provisions in the proposal can combat the rising tideof young smokers.<BR><BR> &quot;Teen tobacco use is like a runaway freight train. And Joe Camel is at the controls.Pediatricians, parents and educators need these federal rules to put on the brakes and to curb theeasy access and allure of tobacco,&quot; Dr. Heyman said.<BR><BR> With concerns mounting due to reports of increased youth drug use, advertising restrictions andpublic education can help fundamentally change the way children and adolescents think aboutcigarettes and chewing tobacco, Dr. Heyman said. &quot;Limiting children's daily dose of tobaccopropaganda is critical. It can aid our efforts to reinforce the notion that tobacco and other drugsare not the way to gain acceptance or deal with one's problems.<BR><BR> President Clinton forwarded his proposal to the FDA for comment and review last August. His approvalgives the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products as drug-delivery devices.<BR><BR> Other provisions ban tobacco vending machine sales, require age-verification for purchases, restrictadvertising in publications with large proportions of youth readers, prohibit advertising onbillboards near schools and playgrounds, and ban name-brand sponsorship of sporting events and logoson promotional items, such as t-shirts.<BR><BR>The American Academy of Pediatrics is an organization of 50,000 pediatricians dedicated to thehealth, safety and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and young adults.<BR><BR>CONTACT: Margorie Tharp or Leigh Ann Bluestein of the American Academy of Pediatrics, 800-336-5475 or202-347-8600<BR></td></tr></table><br><hr><center><h4> <a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |  <a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |    <a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> | <a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |    <A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |  <a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center> <img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left>   <address>We love to talk with you.

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), Now Products of Cicero, Ill., is
announcing a recall to home repair approximately 20,000 foam chairs for
children. Children can unzip the chair's fabric cover,
exposing a thin, clear plastic liner, which could cause choking. </p>

<p>Now Products is aware of two incidents of children who removed
the plastic from the furniture and placed the plastic in their mouth. One
child required medical treatment.</p>

<p>The foam chairs measure 11 inches high, 11 inches wide, and 15.5 inches
deep. The chair's fabric cover features pictures of
animals and children's drawings. A white label which reads in part, "NOW
PRODUCTS INC." and a zipper are located on the bottom
of the chair.</p>

<p>Ames Department stores sold the chairs with matching ottomans and sofas
nationwide from January 1994 through June 1996 for approximately $50. </p>

<p>Consumers should take the chairs away from children until the
chairs have been repaired. For a free repair kit, consumers should call Now
Products at (800) 535-3218, extension 33, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
Central time, Monday through Friday. </p>

<p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public
from unreasonable risks of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer
products under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information
on CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or
CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To order a press release through
fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and
enter the release number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall
information at CPSC's web site at http://www.cpsc.gov or via Internet gopher

Partners In Learning: How Schools Can Support  Family Involvement In Education </a><br><br>

<td valign=top>

<p>Family and school represent the primary environments in which young
children grow and develop. Today, the link between these institutions is
taking on added significance as concern mounts over the challenges that
preschools face in building or maintaining strong parent participation. In
order to effectively meet the needs of all families, parent participation
programs need to give equal consideration to the needs of all families
represented in the class.  Teachers can plan parent participation strategies
for their own classroom through use of the following guides.</p>

<hr>

<a name="plan"></a>
<h3>Plan For Parent Participation</h3>

<p>1. A good place to begin is to document the barriers to parent involvement
created by such factors as family structures (dual career, single parent,
teenage parent) and family work schedules (full-time, job sharing,
flex-time). This can be accomplished through parent-teacher conferences,
telephone calls, or a short questionnaire.</p>

<p>Documentation of the barriers to parent participation can be used to
develop policies that are likely to work with the parent community. For
example, more options may be needed as to when parent-teacher conferences are
held (before, during, and after school), how they are held (face-to-face, by
telephone, by computer, in small groups), or where they are held (at the
school, in the home, at a neighborhood center, or at the parent's place of
employment).</p>

<p>2. Recommendations for parent participation should take into account the
resources and expertise of parents. Care should be taken to offer parents a
range of support, partnership, and leadership roles. Parents can participate
by preparing classroom materials, serving on a committee to select classroom 
equipment and materials, or becoming a member of a search committee to select
personnel. Participation can even extend to parents' leading classroom
activities in which they have expertise.</p>

<p>3. Teachers can include topics that relate to both classroom and family
environments when they develop informational newsletters, public relations
material, and parent meetings. Family strengths, parent-child communication,
childhood stress, and in-home safety all have the potential to affect
children's classroom behavior. Of equal importance is the effect of these
topics on family well-being. 
Schools can meet their objectives and serve the interests and needs of
families by offering information and  educational programs that give parents practical suggestions on topics like these and others.</p>

<p>4. Plan ahead for parent-teacher conferences. Communicate to parents at
the beginning of the year about school policies and services. Inform parents
about classroom goals for the year, and give a few examples of what children
will be learning. Also let parents know about the frequency and nature of
parent-teacher conferences. Once conferences are set, keep a calendar of
when, how, and where family contacts are to be made.</p>

<p>5. For some parents, education today is quite different from what they
experienced two or three decades ago. Fear of the unknown may be one reason
that parents avoid contact with their child's school. For other parents,
school may be intimidating because it reminds them of an unpleasant school 
experience. Empower parents with confidence by supplying them with a list of
questions they can ask teachers throughout the school year.</p>

<p>6. Create a comfortable conference environment in which parents feel free
to share information, ask questions, and make recommendations. Allowing
parents to begin the conference by asking their own questions and expressing
their own concerns is one way to convey respect for their input. Here are
some other ways to share responsibility with parents during the
conference:</p>
<UL>
<li>Schedule an adequate amount of time for the conference so that the parent
does not feel rushed.<br><br>

<li>If the conference is held at the school, point out to the parent the
projects that involved his or her child.<br><br>

<li>Begin and end the conference by noting something positive about the
child. <br><br>

<li>Ask open-ended questions ("How do you help your child with her shyness?")
instead of "yes" or "no" questions ("Do you help your child with her
shyness?"). <br><br>

<li>Communicate in a way that matches, yet shows respect for, the parent's
background. Be careful not to make assumptions about a parent's level of
knowledge or understanding, and avoid talking down to parents.<br><br>

<li>Send nonverbal messages of respect and interest. Sit facing the parent
and maintain good eye-contact. Put aside paperwork and postpone taking notes
until after the conference has ended.<br><br>

<li>Instead of offering advice, ask the parent to share feelings and
suggestions for addressing an issue. Then offer your own input as a basis for
negotiation. <br><br>
</UL>

<p>7. Limit the number of educational objectives set during the
parent-teacher conference to those that can reasonably be addressed in a
specified time. Break each objective down into simple steps. Assign parents
and teachers responsibilities for meeting each objective in the class and
home. Plan a strategy for evaluating the objectives from both the parents'
and teacher's perspective.</p>

<p>8. Follow up the parent-teacher conference with a brief note thanking the
parents for their participation. This is also a good opportunity to summarize
major points discussed during the conference.</p>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="parent"></a>
<h3>Plan For Multicultural Parent Participation</h3>

<p>1. Seek advice and assistance from parents in introducing young children
to various cultures through the use of stories, holidays, art exhibits,
fairs, plays, and other events. Always include in any discussion of cultural
differences the ways in which such values as honesty, fairness, loyalty, and
industry are shared by all cultures.</p>

<p>2. Avoid making sweeping generalizations about children from different
family backgrounds. For example, it has been suggested that a highly
structured and verbal-based curriculum is at odds with the nonverbal,
people-oriented, and individualistic values found in the cultural background
of Black children (Hale-Benson, 1982). Modeling and imitation has been
suggested as a big part of the learning process for Hispanic children
(Hadley, 1987). In contrast, it has been suggested that a structured
curriculum would perhaps be most appropriate for Vietnamese children who are
taught to value obedience and dependence (Bowman &amp;amp; Brady, 1982). It is
unlikely that the authors of these studies meant for their suggestions to
hold for all children from Black, Hispanic, or Vietnamese families. Balance
general cultural differences with an assessment of the individual child, and
of the child's family and neighborhood environments. Otherwise, sweeping
generalizations about children may be based on superficial group
characteristics (for example, color of skin or language spoken) rather than
on individual strengths and needs.</p>

<p>3. Periodically review social networks among children. Do certain children
segregate themselves through their choice of toys, activities, or play? This
issue is an important one, because, as Karnes and her colleagues (1983)
found, children from low-income families who are placed in middle-class
preschool programs can still be segregated from their peers during classroom
activities. Teachers can help all children share classroom experiences by
encouraging those children with similar interests to play together or work
together on a special project.  Children's assignments to small group
activities can be periodically  rotated to ensure that the children have many opportunities to learn about and from all their classroom peers.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>As American families continue to change, programs for young children will
need to adopt parent participation programs that reinforce a consistency of
early growth and development experiences between children's family and
classroom environments. Strong linkages between the school and the home can
be ensured when teachers are routinely allowed the time and resources to
discuss the impact on school-home relations of the diversity of family
structures, backgrounds, and lifestyles found in their classrooms; and 
develop a range of strategies by which they can involve all families of the
young children they teach.</p>

<td valign=top>

<p>It is only natural for parents to wonder occasionally if the development
of their preschooler is going well. Questions such as, is my child doing what
he or she is supposed to at this age? and, do all four-year-olds behave this
way in the same situations? reflect a natural desire to be sure the child is
progressing normally. Over the years, psychologists have developed many
normative scales to indicate how an individual child compares with others of
a given age in similar populations.</p>

<p>This digest focuses on the question of individual growth, namely, is the
individual child's development going so well that he or she can be described
as thriving? As parents look at their own young  children's behavior and
achievements on the categories outlined below, they can address the question,
what aspects of my child's development need special encouragement, support,
or intervention right now? </p>

<a name="Assess"></a>
<h3>Categories Of Behavior To Assess</h3>

<p>In the course of development, ups and downs are inevitable even for
children whose physical and mental endowments are normal. Occasionally
children require intervention to get them successfully through a "down"
period. Parents can observe behaviors in the eleven categories listed below
during periods when they suspect a bit of a downturn. Keep in mind that
difficulties in any single category are no cause for alarm. Indeed,
difficulties in several categories do not imply irreversible problems;
rather, they help us notice those periods when the child's life situation,
for many possible reasons, is a bit out of adjustment with his or her
emerging needs.</p>

<p>For three-year-olds, a look at their behavior on the following criteria
for a period of about three weeks is desirable. For four-year-olds, four
weeks should give a reliable picture of the quality of the child's life. At
five years, add another week, and so forth. Be careful not to judge their
permanent behavior based on one day's observation! All of us, children and
adults, have the occasional really bad day!</p>

<B><p>1. Sleeping Habits</p></B>
<p>Does The Child Usually Fall Asleep Easily And Wake Up Rested, Ready To Get
On With Life?</p>
<p>Occasional restless nights, nightmares, or grouchy mornings are all right.
The average pattern of deep sleep resulting in morning eagerness is a good
sign that the child experiences life as satisfying. Frequent insomnia or
morning grouchiness for three or four weeks may indicate that a child is
trying to cope with excessive stress, and a modification in life style might
be tried. </p>

<B><p>2. Eating Habits</p></B>
<p>Does The Child Usually  Eat With Appetite? </p>
<p>Occasional skipping of meals or refusal of food is to be expected.
Sometimes a child is too busy with absorbing activities to bother with food
at mealtimes. Also, remember that children may eat a lot at one meal and
hardly anything at the next. However, a preschooler who for several weeks
eats as though famine were around the corner or who constantly fusses about
the menu or picks at the food may be asking  for comfort.</p>

<B><p>3. Toilet Habits </p></B>
<p>Does The Child Have, On The Average Over Several Weeks, Bowel And Bladder
Control, Especially During The Day?</p>
<p>Occasional "accidents" are all right, particularly under special
circumstances, such as excessive intake of liquids, intestinal upset, or an
intense concentration with ongoing activity so that the child is too bsorbed
to attend to such "irrelevancies." Children who sleep well often take longer
to stay continent at night.</p>

<B><p>4. Range Of Emotions</p></B>
<p>Does The Child Show The Capacity For A Range Of Emotions Such As Joy,
Anger, Sorrow, Grief, Enthusiasm, Excitement, Frustration, Love, And
Affection?</p>
<p>These need not be exhibited all in one day, of course, but should be seen
over several weeks. A child whose emotions don't vary who is always angry or
sour or enthusiastic may be in trouble. Note that expressions of sadness are
not necessarily problematical; in appropriate situations, they can indicate
the ability to really care about others.</p>

<B><p>5. Friendship </p></B>
<p>Can The Child Initiate And Maintain Satisfying Relationships With One Or
More Peers?</p>
<p>A child who often plays alone is not experiencing a developmental problem
as long as the cause is not insufficient social competence. A child who is
fearful of peers or who frequently claims superiority over others may be
seeking reassurance or may doubt his or her ability to meet parents' lofty
expectations.  </p>

<B><p>6. Variations In Play</p></B>
<p>Does The Child's Play Vary, And Does The Child Add Elements To The Play,
Even Though The Play  Is With The Same Toys Or Materials?</p>
<p>A child who ritualistically and repetitively goes through the same
sequence of play, with the same elements and in the same way, may be
emotionally "stuck in neutral," indicating perhaps that the child has
insufficient inner security to "play with the environment."</p>

<B><p>7. Respones To Authority</p></B>
<p>Does The Child Usually Accept Adult Authority?</p>
<p>Occasional resistance, self-assertion, protest, and objections, when
followed by ultimate yielding to the  adult, indicate healthy socialization
processes. Unfailing acceptance of adult demands and restrictions without a
peep suggest excessive anxiety.</p>

<B><p>8. Curiosity</p></B>
<p>Does the child occasionally exhibit curiosity, adventure, and even
mischief? </p>
<p>A child who never pries or snoops where forbidden may not be pushing
against perceived boundaries enough for healthy development or may fear
punishment excessively. On the other hand, frequent manifestation of  these
behaviors may indicate a search for boundaries.</p>

<B><p>9. Interest</p></B>

<p>Does the child occasionally become involved, absorbed, and interested in
something outside of him- or herself?</p> 
<p>The emphasis here is on sustained involvement in "activities" rather than
in "passivities" such as television. A preschooler who cannot become absorbed
in an activity or who rarely stays with a project until completion may need
help.</p>

<B><p>10. Spontaneous Affection</p></B>
<p>Does The Child Express Spontaneous Affection For One Or More Of Those
Responsible For His Or Her Care?</p> 
<p>Note that this criterion refers to spontaneous declarations of love, not
such displays as the required goodnight kiss. Also, demonstrations of
affection vary among families and cultures and must be taken into account on
this criterion. Nevertheless, in culturally appropriate ways, a child who is
thriving is likely occasionally to express affection toward caretakers and
deep pleasure in being with them. Excessive expressions of this kind,
however, may signal doubts about the feelings caretakers have toward the
child.</p>

<B><p>11. Enjoyment Of The "Good Things Of Life"</p></B>

<p>Does the child enjoy the "good things of life?"</p> 
<p>For young children, playing with others; going to picnics, parties,
festivals, and new places; and exploring new toys are parts of the good life.
If a child has a problem such as shyness, fear of dogs, or food dislikes, but
the problem is not so severe that it prevents him or her from enjoying
childhood pleasures, then assume that the child will outgrow the problem. If,
however, problems do prevent enjoyment of the good things of childhood, help
is called for.</p>

<a name="intervention"></a>
<h3>Suggestions For Intervention</h3> 

<p>The first three of these eleven criteria of sound development sleeping,
eating, and toilet habits are particularly sensitive indicators of the
child's well-being because only the child has control of them. The other
criteria are more culture-bound and situationally determined. When the
pattern of a child's behavior on about half of the criteria seems less than
optimum over a period of about a month, some remedial action should be
taken.</p>

<p>While each individual case will require its own special intervention, some
general approaches are worth trying right away. For example, no matter what
the underlying cause, almost all young children respond well to spending time
alone with an adult who is important to them. The important adult may be a
parent, relative, caregiver, or anyone else with whom the child has a
significant relationship. The time can be spent walking around the block,
helping to tidy up a closet, gardening, baking a cake, or doing anything else
the child really enjoys. The activity should be simple; it need not be an
exotic trip to a faraway place. The main point is having someone special all
to oneself. A few minutes a day for a few weeks will invariably help
alleviate whatever stresses the child has encountered. Once the level of
stress is reduced and the child is more relaxed, he or she may then become
more responsive to a parent's guidance and suggestions about how to cope with
the problem at hand.</p>

<p>In some cases a child's development can get back on track when his or her
daily routines are simplified.  Many preschoolers have a hard time coping
with frequent, rapid, changes in environments within a day or week in which
they are expected to be responsive and cooperative, to exercise self-control,
and to be self-sufficient. For such children, reducing the number and rate of
changes can go a long way to helping them "get back on the right foot."</p>

<P>Becoming a foster parent will change your life-style. Maybe not at first, but as months and years pass you will be affected. Foster care will affect you and your family in many areas (extended family, community involvement, your personal activities, and those of your children.) The changes, like life around us, range from very good to very negative. </P>

<P>You will find that your relatives fit into two categories when you inform them that you are going to <B>take in</B> a foster child. Either they proclaim you the saints of the family or just plain nuts. 

Whichever side of the discussion they voice their opinion on, your	
choice to take in foster children puts them in various dilemmas. Grandparents suffer through a multitude of questions. Besides the normal dilemma of whether to include the foster child on their Christmas list, I had a grandparent question whether they should be included in their will. If you only take one or	
two foster children into your homein your lifetime those questions may	
need an honest answer, but after ten or more foster children the questions
become moot.</P>

<P>Foster parents are trained to respect the privacy of the foster child and their families. Relatives don't always understand why you can't tell them about their <B>new</B> niece or nephew. Their bewilderment only gets worse when the child acts out in an inappropriate manner and you can't justify the behavior because the past history falls into the data privacy area. For some families this leads to selective invitations, where only certain individuals, or only adults are invited over. What do you do in those special circumstances? Cousins will get married, families will want a family portrait, what is the best way to handle special circumstances? No matter how many or what types of children you care for, the one thing that relatives will come to realize is that you are a very busy person. As the years pass, and you have to react to foster care emergency after emergency, you may find that the visits and the invitations become few and far between. </P>

<P>The community, your neighbors, are not much different. There may be a few who would like to blame you for every wrong that happens in the neighborhood, because you brought <B>those kids</B> into your home. Most, though, think it's wonderful that you can do what you do, just keep them in your yard. </P>

<P>Our police officers know us by name and most of the teachers at the school refer to us as <B>that house</B>. The ones we work with on a regular basis are supportive and complimentary, the rest just raise their eyebrows when we pass them on the street. Church members work hard to include the children in activities, but never invite the <B>whole</B> family over for dinner. (If someone 
did once, it never happened twice.) Foster families tend to be larger than the <B>norm</B>, and size alone can cause discomfort, without adding the
abnormal behavior factor. Foster families are very visible to the
community and can add additional pressures whether real or imaginary. As the adult of the foster family, you will constantly find yourself surrounded by people and yet very much alone.</P>

<P>Being a foster parent will develop your skills as a independent social director, therapist, and taxi service, to mention just a few.
Activities that you took for granted as a member of the adult world will
be infringed upon by the children you invited into your home. If you are
physically active, and participating in athletic pursuits, your activities may
change when the teenager you accept into your home is too paranoid to ride a bike, skate, or go in a boat. The activities of the whole family will be tailored to fit the least adaptable member. Need for attention or preconceived fears will stimulate pseudo injuries or refusals to participate. Your social outings will be disrupted by unruly children or true emergencies (you will have more than you could imagine). The foster children you choose to bring into your home will have all the normal problems, but accelerated to an abnormal pace. </P>


<P>You will be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The safety and welfare of the foster children will be a constant priority. Your birth children will grow up with "the street in their home." They will, at a young age, be aware of the cruelties that the children of this world face. They will endure pressures at home where they were intending to find refuge. Your choice to take in foster children will either send them on the streets in rebellion or give them skills to become outstanding young adults. It is not uncommon to find your birth children very active outside the home. They will participate in the community, not only because they choose to, but because it is a release from the constant pressure foster care places on them. Your choice to accept a foster child into your home will change your birth child for life. When you are old, no one will remember what you did. Except for: </P>

<blockquote>

<P>A child, now an adult, who has a life with a little more purpose and a lot more love, </P>

<P>A child who would never have experienced an alternate "safe family" except that you chose to be a foster parent. </P>

<P>Who has a job and pay the bills, because you taught them how to work. </P>

<P>Who completed school, because you ensured that the homework was done. </P>

<P>Who treats their family with respect, because you modeled dignity. </P>

</blockquote>

<P><B>Thank you, from all of them!</B> </P>

<P>	WASHINGTON, Aug. 15, 1996 -- The National Foundation for Infectious Diseases today issued the following:</P>

<P>	Health officials presented data today that reveal continuing threats to the health of our nation's teens from immunizable infectious diseases. They called for all 11 to 12-year-old adolescents to be adequately immunized, noting that the back-to-school period is an ideal time to assess vaccination status. Also divulged during the news conference were figures on measles outbreaks during the 1995-96 season, details on the new availability of the chicken pox vaccine, and results of a national survey of adolescents and their knowledge and perceptions of vaccines.</P>

<H3>Chicken pox More Serious in Adolescents</H3>

<P>	Alarmingly, 20% of our nation's 11 to 12-year-old adolescents haven't had chicken pox, and therefore are at risk. Although chicken pox is usually considered a benign childhood disease, it can cause complications such as bacterial superinfections, encephalitis, pneumonia and Reye's syndrome. The disease results in the hospitalization of more than 9,000 previously healthy people each year, and as many as 50 to 90 people die each year from chicken pox complications. "Adolescents who develop varicella may be ill for over a week, miss school for that interval, and be at greater risk than children to develop varicella complications, said Anne Gershon, M.D., Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. This makes it all the more crucial for those adolescents who have not had chicken pox to receive the vaccine. "It is highly recommended for adolescents 11 to 12 years of age who have not had varicella." said Gershon.</P>

<P>	Just in time for fall immunizations, many public health clinics nationwide will begin to offer the chicken pox vaccine. About 60% of U.S. children now receive their immunizations through federal and state funded programs, including the federal Vaccines for Children program. Availability of the chicken pox vaccine through these and private providers will protect tens of thousands of children and adolescents from the disease.</P>

<H3>Adolescents in High-Risk Group for Measles</H3>

<P>	Adolescents are among three groups at high risk for contracting measles, along with college students and health care workers. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been 17 outbreaks of measles in the United States thus far this year, resulting in 276 individual cases. More than 70% of these cases occurred among those 10 years old or older. Most had received no measles vaccine or only one dose. "Measles has shifted from predominately being a disease of young children, to a disease of adolescents and young adults," stated Gregory Poland, M.D., Chair, Mayo Vaccine Research Group, and Chair of the National Coalition for Adult Immunization. The death rate among those who contract measles varies, from one in 1,000 cases to three in 1,000 cases. Measles is often far more serious when contracted later in life. Two doses of measles vaccine are recommended and will provide protection to most persons. Therefore, it is imperative that adolescents returning to school this fall be up-to-date with two doses of measles vaccine.</P>

<H3>Most Hepatitis B Occurring Among Adolescents and Young Adults</H3>

<P>	While the overall incidence of hepatitis B is decreasing, the CDC reported that 70% of new cases occur in adolescents or young adults 15 to 39 years old. Routine immunization of adolescents against hepatitis B has been recommended since 1995.  Beginning in 1996, the National Health Interview Survey will provide vaccination coverage data on a national sample of adolescents. Every day, 11 to 14 people die from hepatitis B-related illnesses and liver cancer.</P>

<P>	Common modes of disease transmission include sexual contact; maternal-fetal transmission at birth, sharing toothbrushes and razors; using unsterilized needles for injection drug use, body piercing, tattooing or acupuncture; and living with someone infected with hepatitis B. "What is frightening to note, however, is that one-third of individuals with acute hepatitis B do not have a readily identifiable source for their infection," said Harold Margolis, M.D., Chief, Hepatitis Branch, CDC. "Immunization at age 11 to 12 is crucial to ensuring that all teens are properly immunized against hepatitis B."</P>

<H3>Diphtheria Outbreaks Threaten
</H3>
<P>	Diphtheria represents another potential threat to adolescent health, due to waning of vaccine protection received in infancy. In a Minnesota survey, 62% of persons 18 to 39 years old lacked adequate protection against diphtheria.</P>

<P>	Although there have been no recent diphtheria epidemics in the U.S., and while only zero to 5 cases are reported each year, an outbreak could occur at any time. In 1994, there were over 47,000 cases and over 1,700 deaths due to diphtheria in the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union, as well as a number of cases in Europe. "In this age of global travel, diphtheria could easily cross the ocean," said Dr. Gershon. "The back-to-school visit is the ideal time for adolescents to receive a booster shot to protect them from this dangerous disease."</P>

<H3>Results of National Survey</H3>

<P>	Public health experts point out that many adolescents are not receiving the immunizations they require. This is partly blamed on the fact that since the advent of vaccines, diseases such as measles mumps, rubella and diphtheria no longer plague our nation in epidemic proportions. Vaccines have reduced the fear of these diseases among adults, and thus the fear -- and knowledge of these diseases -- has not been passed on to children and adolescents.</P>

<P>	Steven Mostow, M.D., Chairman, Department of Medicine, Rose Medical Center in Denver, and Director, National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, cited a recent national survey, sponsored by Merck &amp; Co., Inc., of adolescents and their knowledge and perceptions of vaccines. "Vaccines and national immunization programs have significantly reduced childhood infectious diseases in America," states Dr. Mostow. "However, this success is paralleled by a generally low name recognition and understanding of these diseases among children today."</P>

<P>	For example, when asked if they knew what polio was, 55% of 10 to 12 year olds had heard the word before, and of those, only 26% reported knowing what it meant. Furthermore, most children who claimed they knew what polio was gave responses that indicated only partial knowledge of the disease, such as "Franklin D. Roosevelt died from it, or It is caused by unclean drinking or pool water." When asked if they had heard the word "rubella," 22% of 10 to 12 year-olds said they had, yet only 4% reported any knowledge of the disease. Rubella is a disease which can cause serious complications during pregnancy, leading to fetal death, premature delivery, and congenital birth defects.</P>

<P>	By contrast, for chicken pox, a disease most adolescents have experienced, 100% report having heard of it, and 95% reported knowledge of the disease. Similarly, 97% of 10 to 12 year-olds had heard the word measles, and 72% claimed awareness of the disease, most likely due to recent outbreaks.</P>

<H3>Missed Opportunities
</H3>
<P>	One proposed solution to the problem of inadequate immunization of adolescents is the routine preventive care visit at age 11 to 12 years. This visit, already recommended by a number of professional medical organizations, would enable health care professionals to administer any necessary boosters, as well as provide other recommended preventive services.</P>

<P>	Experts point out that routine visits for infants and large-scale childhood immunization campaigns have significantly increased immunization rates for infants and young children, but there has been virtually no focus on adolescents.</P>

<P>	"Comprehensive adolescent immunization activities are needed to achieve national disease elimination goals," stated Walter W. Williams, M.D., Chief, Adult Vaccine Preventable Diseases Branch, National Immunization Program, CDC. "An effective adolescent immunization strategy should include review of immunization status, delivery of indicated vaccines, and provision of other preventive services as needed. Dr. Williams notes that laws and regulations requiring immunization for school entry can he a very effective tool in increasing vaccination levels and decreasing spread of disease.</P>

<p>One tool that schools use to learn about students is the standardized
test.  This brochure explains basic features of these tests and suggests
questions you might ask your child's teacher about testing.  Understanding
the role of testing will help you to enable your child to succeed in school
and to develop a better relationship between your family and your child's
school.</p>

<hr>

<a name="Tests"></a>
<h3>What Are Standardized Tests?</h3>

<p>Usually created by commercial test publishers, standardized tests are
designed to give a common measure of students' performance.  Because large
numbers of students throughout the country take the
same test, they give educators a common yardstick or ``standard'' of
measure.  Educators use these standardized tests to tell how well school
programs are succeeding or to give themselves a picture
of the skills and abilities of today's students.</p>

<p>Some popular tests include the California Achievement Tests (the CAT),
the Stanford Achievement Test, the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (the ITBS), and
the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale.</p>

<hr>

<a name="Schools"></a>
<h3>Why Do Schools Use Standardized Tests?</h3>

<p>Standardized tests can help teachers and administrators make decisions
regarding the instructional program.  They help schools measure how students
in a given class, school, or school system
perform in relation to other students who take the same test.  Using the
results from these tests, teachers and administrators can evaluate the
school system, a school program, or a particular student.</p>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="How"></a>
<h3>How Do Schools Use Standardized Tests?</h3>

<p>Different types of standardized tests have different purposes.
Standardized achievement tests measure how much students have already
learned about a school subject.  The results from these tests can help
teachers develop programs that suit students' achievement levels in each
subject area, such as reading, math, language skills, spelling, or science.</p>

<p>Standardized aptitude tests measure students' abilities to learn in
school--how well they are likely to do in future school work. Instead of
measuring knowledge of subjects taught in school, these tests measure a
broad range of abilities or skills that are considered important to success
in school.  They can measure verbal ability, mechanical ability, creativity,
clerical ability, or abstract reasoning.  The results from aptitude tests
help teachers to plan instruction that is appropriate for the students'
levels.</p>  

<p>Educators most commonly use achievement and aptitude tests to</p>
<UL>    

<li>Evaluate School Programs;<br><br>
<li>Report On  Students' Progress;<br><br>
<li>Diagnose Students' Strengths And Weaknesses;<br><br>
<li>Select Students For Special Programs;<br><br>
<li>Place Students In Special Groups; And<br><br>
<li>Certify Student Achievement (For Example, Award High School Diplomas Or
Promote Students From Grade To Grade).<br><br>
</UL>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Placement"></a>
<h3>Can Standardized Tests Alone Determine My  Child's Placement In The
Classroom?</h3>

<p>NO.  Paper-and-pencil tests give teachers only part of the picture of
your child's strengths and weaknesses.  Teachers combine the results of many
methods to gain insights into the skills, abilities, and knowledge of your
child.  These methods include</p>   

<UL>
<li>Observing Students In The Classroom;<br><br>
<li>Evaluating Their Day-To-Day Classwork;<br><br>
<li>Grading Their Homework Assignments;<br><br>
<li>Meeting With Their Parents; And<br><br>
<li>Keeping Close Track Of How Students Change Or Grow Throughout The
Year. 
</UL>

<p>Standardized tests have limitations.  These tests are not perfect
measures of what individual students can or cannot do or of everything
students learn.  Also, your child's scores on a particular test may vary
from day to day, depending on whether your child guesses, receives clear
directions, follows the directions
carefully, takes the test seriously, and is comfortable in taking the test.</p>

<hr>

<a name="Help"></a>
<h3>How Can I Help My Child Do Well On Tests?</h3>

<p>Here are a few suggestions for parents who want to help their
children do well on tests.</p>    
<UL>

<li>First and most important, talk to your child's teacher often to
   monitor your child's progress and find out what activities you
   can do at home to help your child.<br><br>

<li>Make sure your child does his or her homework.<br><br>

<li>Make sure your child is well-rested and eats a well-rounded  
   diet.<br><br>
  
<li>Have a variety of books and magazines at home to encourage your
   child's curiosity.<br><br>
  
<li>Don't be overly anxious about test scores, but encourage your
   child to take tests seriously.<br><br>

<li>Don't judge your child on the basis of a simple test score.<br><br>
</ul>

<hr>

<a name="Teacher"></a>
<h3>What Should I Ask My Child's Teacher?

Before The Test . . .</h3>
<UL>

<li>Which tests will be administered during the school year and for
   what purposes?<br><br>
  
<li>How will the teacher or the school use the results of the test?<br><br>

<li>What other means of evaluation will the teacher or the school
   use to measure your child's performance?<br><br>
  
<li>Should your child practice taking tests?<br><br>
</UL>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="After"></a>
<h3>After The Test . . .</h3>
<UL>

<li>How do students in your child's school compare with students in
   other school systems in your state and across the country?<br><br>

<li>What do the test results mean about your child's skills and
   abilities?<br><br>
  
<li>Are the test results consistent with your child's performance in
   the classroom?<br><br>
  
<li>Are any changes anticipated in your child's educational program?<br><br>

<li>What can you do at home to help your child strengthen particular
   skills?<br><br>
   
   </ul>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Legal"></a>
<h3>What Are My Legal Rights?</h3>

<p>Several precedents and laws define legal rights related to taking
tests in school:</p>

<ul>

<li>Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, also
   known as the Buckley Amendment, you have a right to examine your
   child's academic records.  If these records contain test scores,
   you have a right to see those scores as well.<br><br>

<li>Your child has a right to due process.  For example, your child
   must get adequate notice when a test is required for high school
   graduation and adequate time to prepare for the test.<br><br>

<li>Your child has a right to fair and equitable treatment.  Schools
   cannot, for example, have different test score requirements
   based on gender or race.<br><br>
</UL>

<p>Schools are not, however, necessarily liable for tests and test results
being misused.  Your child's best protection against the misuse of testing
is for you to be knowledgeable about the appropriate uses of various types
of tests.  If you suspect your child is being tested inappropriately, or is
not being tested when
testing would be appropriate, talk with your child's teacher.</p>

<p>Responsibilities of citizenship are obligations to contribute to the
common good by performing duties to benefit the community, such as becoming
informed about public policies, voting in public elections, serving on a
juries, and obeying the laws.</p>

<p>Surveys of civic knowledge, attitudes, and actions reveal serious
deficiencies in the citizenship education of young Americans. Reports on
civic learning by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)
indicate that the majority of 12th-graders have a rudimentary knowledge of
government and citizenship in the United States.  However, half the students
in grade 12 fail to demonstrate knowledge needed for responsible
participation in the political system.  A disturbing finding was that high
school students did "significantly less well" in civics in the most recent
assessment (1988) than their 1982 counterparts.</p>

<a name="Citizenship"></a>
<h3>What Do Young Americans Need To Learn About Responsible Citizenship?</h3>

<p>Our forebearers fought for the rights that Americans enjoy today. 
To preserve our civil rights, young Americans need to realize the
part they must play:  the preservation of civil rights and liberties is
directly linked to performed responsibilities.  For example, the right of
political participation means little when most citizens fail to exercise it.
Furthermore, the right to free expression of political ideas is diminished
when individuals do not gain knowledge about government.  Fulfilling
responsibilities, such as voluntary service to the community, participating
in the political system, acquiring knowledge about civic life, and
demonstrating a public commitment to the values of constitutional democracy
(for example, liberty, justice, and the rule of law) are essential to the
health of a free society.</p>

<p>Most students acknowledge the importance of voting and campaigning
in public elections, but they also tend to express low levels of political
interest and fail to see that their political actions make a difference.
The percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds voting in public elections lags far
behind the rate for those over age 25, which also tends to be much lower
than desired by advocates of responsible citizenship.</p>

<p>Young Americans clearly need to become more attuned to their
responsibilities as citizens of a democratic society.  Parents and
teachers must act in concert to strengthen the desire and capacity
of children to fulfill civic obligations.</p>

<hr>

<a name="Parents"></a>
<h3>What Can Parents Do?</h3>

<p>Parents are children's first and most influential teachers of civic
values and attitudes.  Lessons learned at home about political participation
or community service are likely to set the tone for later learning about
citizenship responsibilities.</p>

<p>Parents can help their children learn more about citizenship by:</p>
<UL>
<li>Setting a good example.  Participate in the political system
   and volunteer for community service projects.  Invite your
   child to join you.<br><br>

<li>Showing interest in civic affairs and government by initiating
   conversations at dinner time or in response to television
   programs or newspaper articles about current events.<br><br>

<li>Requiring children to perform duties regularly at home to
   demonstrate the value of contributing to the common good of
   the family.<br><br>

<li>Encouraging children to take part in community service projects
   such as cleaning up the neighborhood, recycling materials to
   conserve natural resources, and tutoring younger children with
   learning problems.  Participate with them if you can. <br><br>   

<li>Providing civic learning resources in the home--books,
   magazines, newspapers--and using them with children.  For
   example, read articles about political issues or varying
   ethical or moral views.<br><br>

<li>Transmitting and reinforcing the civic values of our 
   constitutional democracy through discussions, exemplary
   behavior, and use of fair rules for orderly family life.<br><br>

<li>Monitoring and reinforcing at home the lessons learned in
   school about the responsibilities of citizenship.<br><br>

</UL>

<hr>

<a name="Schools"></a>
<h3>What Can Schools Do?</h3>

<p>The school also has a major effect on the civic attitudes of
children.  School is the primary agency for teaching about politics
and government.  Schools can enhance education about citizenship
responsibilities through the following activities:</p>
<UL>
<li>Increasing the amount of time all students are involved in civic
   education at all levels of school.<br><br>

<li>Infusing lessons about the responsibilities of citizenship into
   all subjects in all grades, with special emphasis in social
   studies and literature courses.<br><br>

<li>Requiring students to read, analyze, and discuss cases and
   stories about people involved in the civic life of their 
   communities in the past and present.<br><br>

<li>Establishing cooperative learning experiences in which groups
   of students take responsibility for achieving educational
   objectives.<br><br>

<li>Involving students in simulations and role-playing activities
   about various aspects of civic responsibilities.<br><br>

<li>Establishing school-based programs for performing community
   service as a regular part of the civics curriculum.<br><br>

<li>Emphasizing lessons about the civic values of our constitutional
   democracy through role-modeling, reading and writing assignments,
and open discussion of public issues and current events.<br><br>

<li>Making assignments that require students to write letters to
   government officials or newspapers to advocate opinions about
   public issues and policies.<br><br>

<li>Making assignments that require students to participate in
   political activities outside the classroom.<br><br>

<p>Most American children attend kindergarten, and many participate in
all-day kindergarten programs.  While recent reform efforts have
focused on extending the kindergarten day, research suggests that how
kindergartners spend their time may be more critical than the amount of time
children spend in class.  In other words, longer kindergarten days in
unsuitable activities yield no educational advantages over the traditional
half-day kindergarten program.</p>  

<hr>

<a name="Curriculum"></a>
<h3>What Are Appropriate Teaching And Curriculum Approaches For
Kindergartners? </h3>

<p>Early childhood and kindergarten specialists have long emphasized
the central role of play in young children's learning.  In the course of
day-to-day experience with young children, it is easy for teachers to see
that spontaneous play is a natural way of learning; observations of
children's play reveal that play provides a wide range and real depth of
learning in all domains of development: physical, emotional, social, and
intellectual.</p>   

<p>However, it is just as natural for young children to learn through
spontaneous investigation (close observation, experimentation, and inquiry)
as through spontaneous play.  Many observers have noted that young children
are natural scientists and anthropologists. They devote substantial portions
of their seemingly endless energy to learning all aspects of the culture
they are born into:  they learn its language, stories, music, and
literature; they investigate with all their senses and emerging skills what
people mean, when things are appropriate and when they are not, where things
come from, what they are for, how they are made, and how adults and peers
respond to them.  They try to make sense of common objects by prying into
them, taking them apart, and manipulating them in a variety of ways.
Appropriate curriculum and teaching methods include activities and
encouragement for kindergartners in these quests and feature the importance
of individual children's feelings and emotions in group settings.</p>  

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<a name="Kindergarten"></a>
<h3>The Kindergarten Curriculum</h3>  

<p>The developmental characteristics of children of kindergarten age call
for a curriculum that involves a variety and balance of activities that can
be provided in the context of project work (Katz and Chard, 1989).  For
example, kindergarten children can undertake projects in which they
investigate a real event or object.  In the course of such projects, the
children will strengthen emerging literacy and numeracy skills and their
speaking and listening skills and acquire new words as they share their
findings with others.</p>    
<p>A Good Curriculum Provides Activities That Include:</p>   
<UL>
<li>Integrated topic studies, rather than whole-group instruction
    in isolated skills;<br><br>   

<li>Opportunities for children to learn by observing and 
    experimenting with real objects;<br><br>

<li>A balance of child- and teacher-initiated activities;<br><br>  

<li>Opportunities for spontaneous play and teacher-facilitated
    activities;<br><br> 

<li>Group projects in which cooperation can occur naturally;<br><br> 

<li>A range of activities requiring the use of large and small
    muscles;<br><br>  

<li>Exposure to good literature and music of the children's own
    cultures and of other cultures represented in the class;<br><br>  

<li>Authentic assessment of each child's developmental
progress;<br><br>
  
<li>Opportunities for children with diverse backgrounds and
developmental levels to participate in whole-group activities;
and<br><br>

<li>Time for individuals or small groups of children to meet with
    the teacher for specific help in acquiring basic reading,
    writing, mathematical, and other skills as needed.<br><br>  
</UL>

<p>A major challenge for schools concerned with the best use of children's
time in kindergarten is the provision of meaningful teaching and learning
activities.  The wide range of physical, social, and intellectual
characteristics represented in a group 
of contemporary beginning kindergartners makes an informal, flexible
approach to the kindergarten curriculum necessary.</p>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
(CPSC) announced today that with the Department of Justice it is
suing Big Save International Corp. of Los Angeles, Calif., an
importer and wholesaler of children's products. Between 1991 and
1995, Big Save imported more than 70,000 banned or mislabeled
products including bicycles, baby walkers, pacifiers, rattles,
toys, and crayons.</P>
<P>     The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, seeks civil penalties and an injunction. It charges that
the firm and its owner and president, Daniel Yang, ignored
numerous notices of violations from CPSC between 1990 and
1994. Despite the notices, which included warnings of penalties,
the firm continued to import products that violated the Federal
Hazardous Substances Act and the CPSC's safety regulations.</P>
<P>     "The repeated safety violations for the children's
products in this case are inexcusable," said CPSC Chairman Ann
Brown. "No firm will be permitted to profit by cutting corners on
the safety of our most precious and most vulnerable consumers."</P>
<P>     The banned products included toys, pacifiers, and rattles
that separated into small parts when tested and posed a choking
hazard to young children. The products also included bicycles
lacking the required foot brakes on their rear wheels and
accompanying safety and maintenance instructions. All of the
products involved in the lawsuit were either stopped by the U.S.
Customs Service before they could enter the country or recalled.</P>
<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the
public from unreasonable risks of injury or death from 15,000
types of consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction. To
report a dangerous product or a product-related injury and for
information on CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline
at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To
order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051
from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release
number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall information
at CPSC's web site at <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov">http://www.cpsc.gov </a> or via Internet gopher
services at cpsc.gov. Consumers can report product hazards to<a href="mailto:info@cpsc.gov">info@cpsc.gov</a>.</P>

<p>If we search our memories when asked to think of a person who made
a difference in our lives, the individual we remember will, most likely, be
a teacher.  Teachers frequently are remembered as caring and empathetic, as
enthusiastic, positive individuals with a love for learning; as experts in
their subject area; and as believers in the worth of all students and their
ability to succeed.  The qualities we remember are personality traits
teachers need if they are to help children learn.</p>

<a name="Traits"></a>
<h3>What Other Traits Should Teachers Possess?</h3>

<p>Elementary school teachers should have a mastery of mathematics,
science, literature, grammar, writing, spelling, history, geography, art,
and music.  Furthermore, the effective teacher should know how to teach each
of these subjects to every child. Teachers need to understand child
development, the importance of motivation, and the role of reading in the
mastery of learning.</p>

<p>Secondary school teachers should have in-depth knowledge of the subjects
they teach, as well as the ability to transfer that knowledge to students
with diverse needs and interests.  The ability to motivate students is of
prime importance and requires an understanding of adolescent psychology and
learning theory.</p>

<p>These skills should be taught in teacher preparation courses or
alternative route programs.</p>

<p>Qualified teachers also have the ability to identify children with
emotional problems so they can be referred to someone for help and to
enlighten children about the hazards of drugs, smoking, AIDS, and sex.  The
qualified teacher should also have the ability to communicate with parents,
work effectively with school administrators, and accomplish school goals.</p>

<p>Equipping one individual with all these skills is a difficult task. </p>

<h3>How Are Colleges Of Education Preparing Quality Teachers?</h3>

<p>Research in teaching methods has identified certain behaviors that
teachers must demonstrate in order to be rated effective.  Good teacher
preparation programs include opportunities to learn and practice the
following skills:</p>
<UL>
<li>Knowledge of the subjects they teach;<br><br>

<li>Diagnostic and planning skills;<br><br>

<li>Organization and management techniques;<br><br>

<li>An understanding of how children develop and learn; <br><br>

<li>A variety of ways to present information and to develop
    students' thinking;<br><br>
   
<li>The ability and knowledge to make valid evaluations of
    student learning;<br><br>

<li>A willingness to participate in lifelong professional growth; <br><br>

<li>The capacity to make judgments about the effects of particular
teaching practices on individual students' learning; <br><br>

<h3>How Do I Know If My Child's Teacher Has These Skills?</h3>
<UL>
<li>Ask to see your child's homework.  Go over the assignments to see
if he or she understands the subject matter. <br><br>

<li>Question your child about how his or her school day is organized.
Is time designated for group projects, individually initiated
activities, and creative endeavors?<br><br>

<li>Assess the discipline techniques of your child's teacher. Are there
established rules and natural consequences for violations of these
rules?<br><br>

<li>Ask your child's teacher about how he or she evaluates your
child's performance.  Are measures other than standardized tests
    used (e.g., observation, checklists, interviews)?<br><br>

<li>Are comments on your child's written assignments constructive? 
    Does the teacher state WHAT is correct as well as incorrect, Why
    it is correct or incorrect, and HOW to correct or improve the
    errors?<br><br>

<li>When you confer with your child's teacher, ask about the
educational goals he or she has for your child.  Do the goals
    extend beyond academic performance to include social skills?
<br><br>

<li>Ask to observe your child's classroom.  Take notes and later talk
with the teacher about any concerns.<br><br>

<h3>Some Of My Child's Teachers Were Certified To Teach Through An
Alternative Certification Program.  Are They Qualified To Teach?</h3> 

<p>Research shows that teachers certified through an alternative program are
as competent and effective as teachers certified through traditional
education preparation programs.  A growing number of states and school
districts are using nontraditional means to recruit and certify teachers.
Currently, 29 states have established some form of alternative certification
to revitalize the teaching profession.  Universities and public school
systems support these nontraditional means by sponsoring training programs
designed to attract people to the teaching profession who have demonstrated
skills outside of education, especially in critical-need areas.</p>
       
<p>Nearly all alternative certification programs require candidates
to:</p>
<UL>
<li>Have at least a bachelor's degree;<br><br>

<li>Show competence in their subject area by passing a state or
nationally sponsored test;<br><br>

<li>Take professional education courses prior to actually taking 
    charge of a classroom; and <br><br>
   
<li>Work with an experienced teacher who serves as a mentor. <br><br>

</UL>

<p>In some states, an individual who has obtained a bachelor's degree
(preferably in a liberal arts area) and wishes to teach must take only those
teacher preparation courses required by the state.  This route is generally
not shortage-driven and requires some professional preparation and an
internship.  In most cases, individuals must pass appropriate tests, such as
the National Teacher's Exam.  In some states, this route is called a
5th-year program and may enable an individual to meet requirements for both
a master's degree and a teaching certificate.  In many states, continuing
certification requires that teachers take additional courses as part of
their professional development.</p>

<P>Students with special gifts and talents come from all cultural and linguistic 
backgrounds.  Gifted students can be described as possessing an abundance 
of certain abilities that are most highly valued within a particular society 
or culture.  Many minority language children have special talents that are 
valued within their own cultures; unfortunately, these students are often 
not recognized as gifted and talented.</P>

<P>        Most procedures for identifying gifted and talented students have 
been developed for use with middle class children who are native English 
speakers.  Such procedures have led to an under representation of minority 
language students in gifted and talented programs, which in turn prevents 
our schools from developing the strengths and abilities of this special 
population.</P>

<P>        This digest explores the controversy surrounding the 
under representation of minority language students in gifted and talented 
programs and makes recommendations for more suitable assessment 
techniques and program models.</P>

<H3><A NAME="MINORITY">Why Are Minority Language Students Under Represented In Programs For Gifted and Talented Students?</A></H3>

<P>Educators who work closely with minority language students argue that 
using standardized IQ tests as a primary measure of giftedness does not 
fairly accommodate the linguistic and cultural differences of these 
students.  These educators look to identify the "able learner" rather than 
the more narrowly defined gifted student who scores in the top 3% on IQ 
tests.  Able learners are defined by some educators as students in the top 
10% of their class who have shown some extraordinary achievement in one 
or more areas such as science, mathematics, or the performing arts (Ernest 
Bernal, personal communication, September 13, 1988).</P>

<P>        Reliance on IQ tests alone has greatly diminished the potential 
number of gifted students.  Renzulli (1978) indicated that "more creative 
persons come from below the 95th percentile than above it, and if such 
cut-off scores are needed to determine entrance into special programs, we 
may be guilty of actually discriminating against persons who have the 
highest potential for high levels of accomplishment" (p. 182).</P>

<P>        Three percent is a conservative estimate of the percentage of the 
population that is considered gifted.  However, in Arizona, for example, 
only 0.14% of the students in gifted and talented programs come from 
language minority backgrounds (Maker, 1987).  Using the 3% criterion, one 
would estimate that 2,900 limited-English-proficient (LEP) students in 
Arizona could be receiving some type of services for giftedness.  An 
assessment of needs, however, revealed that only 143 LEP children were 
participating in gifted programs, despite the fact that minority language 
students represent 16.17% (96,674) of the school-age population.  Other 
studies indicate that the proportion of Blacks, Hispanics, and American 
Indians identified as gifted represents only half that expected (Chan &#38; 
Kitano, 1986).</P>

<P>        Table 1 illustrates that, nation wide, Caucasians and Asians are 
over represented, while the percentage of Blacks and Hispanics is only half 
what would be expected in gifted and talented programs.</P>

<P>Sources:        Zappia, (1989); Machado, (1987).</P>

<P>        The concept of giftedness as it relates to culture and values can help 
explain why more gifted and talented Asian and Pacific-American students 
have been identified than any other group.  Although these children 
comprise only 2.2% of the school-age population, they constitute 4.4% of 
the identified gifted students, twice the expected number (Kitano, 1986).  
(This figure is slightly lower than the statistic given in Table 1 [2.5%], but 
the table has more recent data.)  The traditional Asian values of 
educational attainment and obedience to authority support achievement in 
U.S. schools, despite the fact that Asian and Pacific-American cultures 
differ in many ways from the majority culture.</P>

<P>        Different learning styles may also contribute to the 
under representation of gifted and talented minority language students.  
Native Americans are often caught between the schools' value of 
independence and the home and community value of interdependence.  In 
school, students generally sit in rows and face the teacher, whereas in 
Native American culture, everyone would be seated in a circle and 
decisions would be made collectively.</P>

<P>        Among many Hispanics, cultural differences may also produce 
manifestations of giftedness that differ from the traditional manifestations 
in the majority culture.  In Puerto Rico, for example, children learn to seek 
the advice of their family rather than act independently (Perrone &#38; 
Aleman, 1983).  Respect for elders is often valued more than 
precociousness, which can be seen as disrespectful.  Similarly, the Mexican-American child who respects elders, the law, and authority becomes 
vulnerable in a school system that values individual competition, initiative, 
and self-direction.</P>

<H3><A NAME="TECHNIQUES">What Are Some Commonly Used Techniques For the Identification of Gifted and Talented Minority Language Students?</A></H3>

<P>Research on the identification of giftedness points to the lack of 
appropriate assessment procedures.  Giftedness is not a trait inherent to 
native English speakers; however, there is a lack of instruments that can 
detect giftedness in minority language students (Gallagher, 1979; Llanes, 
1980; Raupp, 1988; Renzulli, Reis, &#38; Smith, 1981).  Most tests rely on 
either oral or written language skills.  Minority language students who are 
not considered gifted may, in fact, be very gifted, but unable to express 
themselves in English.  Therefore, many researchers urge that great 
caution be exercised in using English standardized tests for the 
identification of linguistic and cultural minority students.  These 
researchers also recommend selecting tests that reduce cultural and 
linguistic bias.</P>

<P>        The identification and assessment of gifted and talented minority-
language students is complex because it involves students who are both 
gifted and talented and from a language or cultural background different 
from that of middle class, native-English-speaking children.  Many 
researchers and practitioners recommend multiple assessment measures to 
give students several opportunities to demonstrate their skills and 
performance potential.</P>

<P>        Each school can establish its own relevant criteria to ensure that the 
screening process is appropriate for a specific target population.  Moreover, 
an assessment team that is sensitive to their needs can represent the 
population to be served in the program.  In addition, teachers can be 
brought into the identification process, because they have the opportunity 
to observe students in numerous academic and social situations.</P>

<P>        An alternative to using English language standardized tests is the 
assessment of LEP students in their native language.  These tests measure 
a variety of skills:  creative thinking skills such as fluency, flexibility, 
originality, and elaboration; intellectual development based on Piaget's 
theory of development (Piaget, 1954; Piaget &#38; Inhelder, 1973); language 
proficiency; and nonverbal perceptual skills of cognitive development.</P>

<P>        Many school districts now include behavioral checklists or 
inventories, nominations, or related techniques to identify gifted and 
talented minority language students.  Checklists usually compare or rate 
the student according to general descriptions or more specific examples of 
behavior deduced from characteristics of gifted persons.  Many of these 
instruments are designed locally, are available from state departments of 
education, or are available commercially.</P>

<P>        Other commonly used methods such as interviews, self-reports, 
autobiographies, and case histories can also be used to identify gifted and 
talented minority language students.  Interviews are often scheduled as 
part of the identification or selection process to determine a candidate's 
general fitness for a program and provide information for instructional 
planning.  The use of case studies to identify giftedness has been 
documented by Renzulli and Smith (1977) and is recommended because it 
relies on multiple sources of information about a student's performance.  
Although these procedures can be cumbersome, time consuming, and 
complex, they can provide the most valid basis for decision making.</P>

<H3><A NAME="PROGRAMS">What Types of Programs Are Available For Gifted and Talented Students, and Are They Suitable For Minority Language Students Who Are Selected To Participate?
</A></H3>

<P>There are as many different types of programs and instructional models 
for gifted and talented LEP students as there are different views of 
intelligence.  The program models discussed in this digest demonstrate a 
wide range of suggestions for choosing a program for gifted and talented 
students and can stimulate ideas about the types of program that can be 
implemented.  However, each district must implement the program that 
will best meet the needs of its gifted and talented minority language 
students.</P>

<P>        Jean M. Blanning, of the Connecticut Clearinghouse for Gifted and 
Talented (1980), suggests that, in general, programs for gifted and talented 
minority language students should allow their students to</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Pursue topics in depth at a pace commensurate with their abilities 
and intensity of interest

	<LI>Explore, branch out on tangents unforeseen when first beginning a 
study, without curriculum parameters confining them to a particular direction

	<LI>Initiate activities, diverge from the structured format, within a 
framework of guidance and resources appropriate for such exploration

	<LI>Ask questions about areas or aspects of studies and find answers 
which lead to more questions

	<LI>Experience emotional involvement with a project because it is based 
on interests and use of higher levels of ability

	<LI>Learn the skills, methodology, and discipline involved in intellectual 
pursuits and/or creative endeavors

	<LI>Think (interpretations, connections, extrapolations) and imagine 
(ideas, images, intuitive insights) to develop fully into their own products

	<LI>Experience the use of intellectual abilities and senses necessary in all
creative endeavors
</UL>

<P><B>Enrichment Programs</B>.  The most common program model for gifted and 
talented students is probably an enrichment program, in which students 
receive instruction in addition to their regular classroom instruction.  
Enrichment programs provide learning experiences designed to extend, 
supplement, or deepen understandings within specific content areas 
(Dannenberg, 1984).  Some enrichment programs provide academic 
services and cultural opportunities for gifted and talented students.</P>

<P>        Gifted and talented LEP students at Louis S. Brandeis High School in 
New York City (Cochran &#38; Cotayo, 1983) attend operas and museums and, 
in this way, become a part of American culture.  Students have said that 
the program has made them feel "special," because they visit places they 
ordinarily would not.  Another example of activities in an enrichment 
program would be to have students studying the prehistoric era watch 
films on dinosaurs, draw pictures of them, and go to a natural history 
museum to see a dinosaur exhibit.</P>

<P>        The decision as to whether or not to implement an enrichment 
program may be greatly affected by the school district's concept of 
giftedness.  If giftedness is considered a quality to be measured through IQ 
tests, then perhaps an enrichment program would be seen as a "frill," 
because it does not concentrate strictly on academics.  On the other hand, 
this program may be particularly appreciated by gifted and talented 
minority language students, since they often do not receive this sort of 
exposure to the arts in a standard instructional program.</P>

<P><B>Resource Rooms</B>.  Another program model uses a resource room, which is 
usually staffed by a resource teacher.  Students may visit the resource 
room to do special assignments or to check out various educational games 
or puzzles.  In a kindergarten/first grade gifted and talented program in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico (Beam, 1980), parents are also able to check out 
items for their children.  The resource room provides an excellent 
opportunity for parents and students to bridge the gap between home and 
school.  However, in many inner-city schools, special programs may be 
needed to obtain the desired levels of parental support.  Also, the 
establishment of a resource room usually requires physical space for the 
room, sufficient operating funds, and a resource teacher who has expertise 
in the area of gifted and talented students.</P>

<P>        The Hartford, Connecticut, program "Encendiendo Una Llama" 
("Lighting a Flame") has been in operation since 1979 and uses a resource 
room, an after-school program, and a regular classroom component to 
provide services for gifted and talented minority language students.  This 
program emphasizes language development in English and Spanish, high-level thinking skills, independent work and study skills, and development 
of creative thinking.  It is an integrated program in which English-dominant children also participate.  In each of the participating Hartford 
schools, the bilingual gifted and talented program is the only gifted 
program in the school, and all children are eligible to participate, 
regardless of their language background.</P>

<P><B>Parent Involvement Programs</B>.  Many programs include a strong parent 
involvement component in which parents can help support their children's 
development at home while the school can be used as an additional 
resource.  Although it is important for all parents to be involved in their 
children's education, it is particularly critical to develop a strong link 
between the home and the school for gifted and talented minority 
language children.</P>

<P>        Many programs provide parents with checklists to help assess their 
children.  In addition, programs often provide booklets of home activities 
through which parents can encourage critical thinking and creativity.</P>

<P><B>Acceleration or Honors Programs</B>.  Many people associate acceleration or 
honors programs with gifted and talented programs.  These programs may 
include skipping grades, early entrance, early graduation, credit by 
examination, nongraded classes, and advanced placement classes 
(Dannenberg, 1984).  Some gifted students who seem bored in school may 
benefit from an accelerated program that provides an academic challenge 
and keeps them involved in school.  However, it may be difficult to 
identify these students, who initially may not be seen as gifted.</P>

<P>        Some educators who adhere to the narrow definition of giftedness as 
high IQ may not feel that an honors program is appropriate for students 
who fit the broader definition of the able learner.  This attitude is refuted 
in the film Stand And Deliver, which is based on a true story about several 
minority language students at an inner-city school in Los Angeles.  These 
students were not considered gifted by many of their teachers, yet they 
were the only students in their school to pass the Advanced Placement 
exams given by the Educational Testing Service for college credit in 
calculus.  Their success can be attributed largely to their mathematics 
teacher, Jaime Escalante, who had very high expectations for them and 
refused to believe that they were unable to think critically simply because 
they were from low-income, minority language backgrounds.  He 
encouraged their participation in these special advanced classes (held at 
night and on Saturdays in overcrowded, stifling classrooms) to prove to 
other students, the faculty, and themselves that they were intelligent.  
Moreover, these students gained new, strong, self-concepts, which 
inevitably improved their academic skills and gave them the courage and 
discipline to pursue a college education.</P>

<P><B>Mentor Programs</B>.  Another program model for gifted and talented 
education is the mentor program.  Mentors provide role models for the 
students, giving them an opportunity to interact with adult professionals.  
Through the Higher Achievement Program in Washington, DC, elementary 
and junior high school students from low-income neighborhoods are 
tutored by volunteers 2 nights a week.  To be eligible for the program, 
students must show a high level of motivation and pass a qualifying 
examination.  One night each week is devoted to verbal skills such as 
reading comprehension, vocabulary, and writing; the second night is 
devoted primarily to mathematics and related skills.  Critical thinking 
skills are stressed in all subjects.</P>

<P>        The mentor program has many psychological and social benefits for 
the students and is a low-cost program if the school district recruits area 
professionals as volunteers.  School districts located near universities can 
encourage them to establish a course in which official credit is given to 
university students who participate as mentors.  If the mentors are 
sensitive to the needs of particular cultural and linguistic groups, they can 
provide positive role models for the students.  The mentor program 
concept can be a solution to difficult budget constraints and has been used 
by numerous school districts around the country.</P>

<H3><A NAME="RECOMMENDATIONS">Recommendations For Change</A></H3>

<P>The following recommendations may improve the assessment and 
educational programs of gifted and talented minority language students.</P>

<UL>
<LI><P><B>Broaden the concept of giftedness</B>.  Broadening the concept of giftedness to include able learners will allow for the identification of a greater 
proportion of gifted minority language students.  A broader definition of 
giftedness may be the first essential step toward identifying and educating 
gifted and talented minority language students.</P>

<LI><P><B>Expand research on giftedness and minority language students</B>.  Although there is a large body of literature on gifted and talented students in 
general, there is much less literature on gifted and talented minority 
language students.  This may be because many researchers in the past did 
not consider minority language students as gifted, based on the traditional 
measure of giftedness as a high IQ score.  Further research is needed on all 
the able learners in our schools, including minority language students.</P>

<LI><P><B>Employ more well-rounded assessment techniques</B>.  If there is a lower-than-expected proportion of minority language students identified as 
gifted, then the identification and assessment process should be examined 
to determine why these students have not been identified.  School districts 
may need to find creative solutions to the problem of how to identify 
gifted and talented minority language students by using nontraditional 
methods.</P>

<P>        The identification of minority language students can include multiple 
criteria (with information from as many sources as possible) that are 
relevant to the needs of the population.  Using multiple instruments can 
result in a more precise picture because it provides information about 
students from different perspectives.  A combination of assessment 
instruments can help ensure that a student's ability to participate 
effectively in a gifted and talented program is adequately measured.</P>

<LI><P><B>Increase staff awareness of their potential for developing a gifted and 
talented program</B>.  Regardless of the program model selected for 
implementation, administrators must first examine the resources they 
have within their school system.  Upon entering the school district, 
teachers could be asked to complete a questionnaire about their abilities 
and interests and whether or not they would be interested in participating 
in a gifted and talented program.  For example, a teacher who has played 
piano for 10 years might be interested in teaching a course in music 
appreciation.  Administrators need to be aware of the unique talents 
within their own staff as they identify local personnel who may be able to 
contribute their time, effort, and expertise to gifted and talented programs.</P>

<LI><P><B>Explore various program models</B>.  No single model can be recommended as 
the "best" instructional approach for gifted and talented minority language 
students, because each population is unique and each program has its own 
specific goals and objectives.  The type of program implemented may 
depend on several issues such as the instructional model, the talents of the 
students, the number of gifted students identified, the talents of the 
professional staff, the availability of qualified personnel, the level of 
commitment of the school and school system, and budget constraints.</P>

<LI><P><B>Increase awareness of different ways giftedness may be manifested in 
different populations</B>.  Many students are gifted or talented.  Teachers face 
the challenge of identifying, developing, and supporting their students' 
talents.  Although this may be a challenge, it is also a rewarding 
experience. Watching students grow to their fullest potential and knowing 
that, as the teacher, you have played an integral part in your students' 
growth are great personal and professional triumphs.</P>

<H3><A NAME="CONCLUSION">Conclusion</A></H3>

<P>This digest highlights some of the current debates in the education of 
gifted and talented students focusing on the definition of giftedness, the 
assessment of gifted students, and the development and implementation of 
gifted programs.  Providing appropriate gifted and talented programs for 
students from linguistically and culturally diverse backgrounds is a 
challenge that many school districts face.  Since minority language students 
represent an increasing percentage of the total school population, meeting 
the educational needs of gifted minority language students is vital. All 
students, including minority language students, deserve the most 
challenging instruction possible.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, July 31 /PRNewswire/ -- The Food and Drug Administration today announced it has licensed the first acellular pertussis vaccine for use in infants and children two months of age and older for the primary series of immunizations. The vaccine protects infants against whooping cough while causing fewer side-effects than whole-cell pertussis vaccines now on the market.</P>

<P>Currently, U.S. children receive a whole-cell pertussis vaccine in combination with diphtheria-tetanus toxoid, commonly called DTP, at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, with additional doses of either a DTP or DT vaccine with an acellular pertussis component (DTaP) at 12-18 months and before going to school.</P>

<P>The vaccine approved today for infants is one of two DTaP vaccines already approved for children to be given as fourth and fifth doses following three DTP doses. This approval should give parents more confidence in the safety of the pertussis vaccine their infants will receive.</P>

<P>Acellular pertussis vaccines contain only the parts of the pertussis bacterium thought to be important for immunity, while whole-cell vaccines, such as the DTP vaccines currently used in the United States for infants, contain the whole, killed bacterium.</P>

<P>"Safety data from several studies show that acellular pertussis vaccines cause fewer adverse reactions in the primary series of immunizations than whole-cell vaccines," said Commissioner of Food and Drugs David A. Kessler, M.D. For a long time there has been concern about side effects with whole-cell vaccine. This new acellular pertussis vaccine, the first of several in the pipeline, represents an important advance."</P>

<P>Whooping cough is a highly communicable disease of the respiratory tract that can be especially serious for infants less than one year old. It can cause spells of coughing and choking that make it hard to breathe: the coughing can last several weeks. Occasionally, infants can die from the disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 1994 and 1995, a total of approximately 9,500 cases of pertussis were reported in the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the disease is responsible each year for approximately 350,000 deaths worldwide in unvaccinated persons.</P>

<P>Several studies, including one randomized, controlled study of 673 infants sponsored by Connaught Laboratories, Inc., indicate that the DTaP vaccines cause fewer adverse reactions than DTP vaccines. These can include local reactions, such as redness or swelling, as well as systemic reactions, such as fever, drowsiness, irritability, or prolonged, high-pitched crying. Studies are in progress to help determine the extent of these reactions when children receive the acellular pertussis vaccine for the entire series of immunizations. Infrequent, serious events such as seizures have been reported after immunizations with both DTP and DTaP vaccines.</P>

<P>Two clinical studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of the pertussis component of this DTaP vaccine for infants. The first placebo-controlled, randomized trial, of the pertussis component conducted in the mid-1980's, included children 5-11 months old in Sweden, and was supported in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). They were immunized according to a different schedule from the one recommended in the United States.</P>

<P>The second study, in Germany, used an immunizing schedule similar to the one used in the United States for the DTaP, and involved over 16,000 infants. Parents were allowed to choose the type of pertussis vaccine their infants would receive, or whether the vaccine even contained a pertussis component. Approximately 75% of the parents chose the DTaP vaccine.</P>

<P>In these studies, the acellular pertussis vaccine was estimated to be between 69 and 80% effective in preventing pertussis, depending on the way the study was designed and completed.</P>

<P>On July 13, l995, NIAID announced results of two large European clinical trials showing that three acellular pertussis vaccines were highly effective in protecting infants while causing fewer of the common side-effects. The acellular pertussis vaccine licensed today for infants was not studied in those trials.</P>

<P>The application for this first DTaP vaccine for infants was received July 21, 1995. Additional clinical data were presented after the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee met in January to discuss this application.</P>

<P>Children who have begun their immunizations with DTP should continue to receive their fourth and fifth doses as DTaP. For those children who will now receive DTaP at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, a fourth dose of DTaP is recommended in the second year of life. Studies are now being planned to help determine recommendations for the fifth dose.</P>

<P>The acellular pertussis component of the vaccine is being produced by the Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University in Japan. It is combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids by Connaught Laboratories, Inc., Swiftwater, Pa., and is sold under the trade name, Tripedia.</P>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer        Product
Safety Commission (CPSC), Playskool Baby, Inc. of  Northvale, N.J., is
voluntarily recalling approximately 38,000 "Fold N' Travel" infant
carriers
because infants may fall out of the carrier. </p>
<p>Playskool has received 10 reports of children falling from the carrier,
including reports of seven infants who suffered serious head injuries.
</p>
<p>The lightweight plastic infant carriers, measuring about 17 inches long
when folded and about 26 inches long when fully extended, were available
in
blue or teal with either a fabric or vinyl pad (model numbers 100,
101,102,
103). Consumers adjust the carrier to any of three positions, rocker,
feeder, or sleeper, by pushing the buttons located on each side of the
carrier's handle near where the handle attaches to the carrier.  The
product
can be folded by squeezing levers located underneath the carrier.</p>
<p>Children's products retailers sold the Fold N' Travel carriers
nationwide from April 1991 through 1993 for approximately $35.00. </p>
<p>Consumers who own Fold N' Travel infant carriers should stop using them
immediately and return the carriers to Playskool or to the store where
purchased, for a full refund. To receive pre-paid shipping materials and
for
information on returning the carriers, consumers should call Playskool at
(800) 447-7707. </p>
<p>Playskool stopped manufacturing Fold N' Travel infant carriers  in
April
1993. </p>

<P>     The staff of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
(CPSC) estimates that child-resistant packaging for aspirin and
oral prescription medicine saved the lives of about 700 children
since the requirements went into effect in the early 1970's.</P>

<P>     CPSC analyzed child fatality data for accidental ingestions
of aspirin and oral prescription medicines.  The death rates for
aspirin and oral prescription medicines declined even after
taking account of the overall decline in the accidental child
death rate from all causes.  The study also accounted for changes
in per capita product consumption and reductions in the aspirin
fatality rate associated with therapeutic overdose.</P>

<P>     The CPSC study showed that child-resistant packaging reduced
the aspirin-related child death rate by up to 0.88 deaths per
million children under age five.  The results also showed that
special packaging reduced the oral prescription medicine-related
death rate by up to 1.27 deaths per million children under age
five.  This represents a fatality rate reduction of up to 45
percent from levels that would have been projected in the absence
of child-resistant packaging requirements.</P>

<P>     The lower fatality rate represents a total reduction of
about 700 child deaths since the requirements for child-resistant
packaging on these products went into effect in the early 1970's.</P>

<P>     The estimate of about 700 lives saved relates to aspirin and
oral prescription medicines only and does not include additional
lives that may have been saved by child-resistant packaging on
other products.  Therefore, the CPSC's staff concludes that
child-resistant packaging saves lives.  Consumers should use
child-resistant packaging to help prevent accidental poisonings
with medicines and household chemicals.</P>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), Christmas Tree Shops Inc. of South Yarmouth, Mass., is
voluntarily recalling about 12,000 toy "Engineering Trucks." The toys
contain small parts, such as the "driver" figure in the truck's front cab,
which may break off during use presenting a potential choking hazard to
young children.</p>
<p>CPSC is not aware of any injuries involving this toy. This recall is
being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury. The State of
Connecticut identified the small parts hazard. </p>
<p>The wooden "Engineering Truck" toys (Item 00011-34416) measure
approximately 6 inches long and 2 inches wide. Each truck has a front cab
section with a small, peg-shaped "driver" figure which measures
approximately 1.5 inches high. The truck's flat bed body features a
hauler,
a cement mixer, an asphalt roller, a crane, or an extension ladder. The
truck has no labeling.</p>
<p>The trucks were packaged in small blue and white cardboard boxes
featuring photographs of the toys. Labeling on the box reads in part,
"ENGINEERING TRUCK EDUCATIONAL TOY... MADE IN CHINA." The box also
includes
the SKU number "000011 34416 2." </p>
<p>Christmas Tree Shops in New England sold the "Engineering Truck" toys
from April 1994 through March 1996 for $1 each.</p>
<p>Consumers should take the truck away from young children immediately
and
return the toy either to the store where purchased or the nearest
Christmas
Tree Shop. For more information about this recall consumers should call
Christmas Tree Shop at (800) 876-9677. </p>
<p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from
unreasonable risks of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer
products
under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's fax-on-demand
service,

<h3>Drug Prevention is a Shared Responsibility</h3>


<p>In the 1980s, there was a steady decline in the use of alcohol and
other drugs among 12- to 17-year-olds.  After a decade of
significant progress, however, a recent survey indicates that this
downward trend has leveled off for some drugs, leaving the rate of
alcohol and some other drug use in the United States still high. </p>

<p>The reasons for drug use are varied.  Children may use drugs to
satisfy their curiosity, conform to peer pressure, relieve anxiety,
or have an adventure.  But, whatever tempts them, we must teach
children to reject drugs because drug use is illegal, harmful to
their health, and interferes with academic and social development.</p>

<p>Drug information programs, while important, cannot stand alone as a
deterrent to drug use.  Current literature has focused on a
"holistic" approach to preventing drug use.  A holistic approach
emphasizes a prevention strategy that takes into account the wide
range of forces that affect children's lives.  Parents, as the
prime nurturers of their children's development, play a prominent
role in preventing drug use.  Schools, communities, social service
organizations, religious groups, law enforcement agencies, the
media, and local businesses also play vital roles. </p>

<h3>How Can Parents Help Prevent Their Children From Using Drugs?</h3>


<p>Parents have many opportunities to foster healthy, drug-free
lifestyles in their children, playing a dominant role in their
children's emotional and interpersonal development from infancy. 
Children are taught ethical values and responsibility through what
social scientists call "modeling," or demonstrating acceptable
behaviors for children to follow.  Parents who have responsible
habits and attitudes regarding drug use send a healthy message and
strongly influence their children's ideas about alcohol, tobacco,
and other drugs.  Parents are models for their children, and even
the use of legal drugs may send the wrong signal.</p> 

<p>A basic reality is that children will have to make their way in a
world that is filled with opportunities to use drugs, but parents
can prepare their children to make positive choices.   High
self-esteem sometimes helps children resist peer pressure to use
drugs, but not always.  Research is unclear about the relationship
between self-esteem and drug use.  However, all children need
opportunities to practice decision-making and to become aware of
the consequences of bad decisions.  Parents need to provide clear,
factual information about drugs and their effects.</p> 

<p>They also need to appropriately supervise their children.  For
example, parents should know their children's friends and be aware
of what their children are doing.  They also need to ensure that
there is proper supervision of after-school and weekend activities
and that all parties are chaperoned by responsible adults.</p>

<h3>How Can Schools Help Prevent Children From Using Drugs?</h3>

<p>Schools can add a crucial component to the drug prevention efforts of
parents by incorporating prevention strategies within the context of health,
science, and family life curricula.  Schools also provide an organized peer
group setting in which children can develop communication and
decision-making skills.</p>

<p>Schools need to have a clear no-use drug and alcohol policy.  Some
schools require students and parents to sign a form agreeing that all
drug-related offenses will be referred to the police and that students who
use drugs, including alcohol, will be required to obtain counseling.</p>

<p>For schools to respond effectively and complement the activities of the
family, the entire community must be involved.  When community members are
asked to provide input into the school's strategy to combat drug abuse, they
can make valuable contributions to the effort and, in turn, add legitimacy
to the schools drug prevention program.</p>

<p>Student Assistance Programs (SAPs) have proven to be quite successful in
combating drug use in many schools.  SAPs involve teams of students,
teachers, administrators, parents, and counselors trained to recognize
causes and symptoms of substance abuse and provide or recommend appropriate
intervention.  Within a SAP, school professionals are able to refer students
confidentially to a "core" or "impact" team that follows up to determine
whether intervention or further referral is required.  These programs can be
tailored to meet the needs of a particular community.</p>

<p>In their classroom practice, teachers can exert significant influence on
the beliefs, attitudes, and opinions of their students and complement other
drug prevention activities.  For example, teachers can hone the
problem-solving and decision-making skills of students by incorporating drug
prevention strategies into daily lesson plans that are geared toward the
social and intellectual needs of their students.  In middle school, for
instance, peer pressure can be intense.  Middle school teachers may use role
playing to help small groups of students practice ways to resist peer
pressure to use alcohol and other drugs.</p>

<p>The use of "peer leaders" has been has been successful both in and out of
school.  Peer leaders receive special training to help them develop strong
communication and problem-solving skills.  They may lead  discussion groups
to give other students a forum to voice their questions and concerns.  The
peer-leader strategy provides positive role models for other students and
strengthens the self-esteem of the peer leaders.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Parents play an important role in educating their children about
drugs, but they cannot do it alone.  Other groups also exert strong
influence over children, including the school, clubs, and teams. 
Schools can increase children's awareness of the negative effects
of drug use and equip them with skills to resist drug and alcohol 
use.  When parents and schools work together within the context of
the larger community, they gain the consensus that will strengthen
drug prevention efforts.</p>

<H3>Definition</H3>

<P>People with severe disabilities are those who traditionally have been labeled as having severe or profound mental retardation. These people require ongoing extensive support in more than one major life activity in order to participate in integrated community settings and enjoy the quality of life available to people with fewer or no disabilities; they frequently have additional disabilities, including movement difficulties, sensory losses and behavior problems.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Incidence"></a>
<H3> Incidence</H3> 

<P>In the 1992-93 school year, the states reported to the U.S. Department of Education that they were providing services to 103,215 students with multiple disabilities (Sixteenth Annual Report to Congress, 1994).</P>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
 <H3>Characteristics</H3> 

<P>People with severe or multiple disabilities may exhibit a wide range of characteristics, depending on the combination and severity of disabilities, and the person's age. There are, however, some traits they may share, including:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Limited speech or communication; <BR>
	<LI>Difficulty in basic physical mobility; <BR>
	<LI>Tendency to forget skills through disuse; <BR>
	<LI>Trouble generalizing skills from one situation to another; and <BR>
	<LI>A need for support in major life activities, e.g., domestic, leisure, community use, vocational.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<a name="Medical"></a> 
 <H3>Medical Implications</H3> 

<P>A variety of medical problems may accompany severe disabilities. Examples include seizures, cerebral palsy, sensory loss, hydrocephalus, and scoliosis. These conditions should be considered when establishing services. A multidisciplinary team consisting of the student's parents, educational specialists and medical specialists in the areas in which the individual demonstrates problems should work together to plan and coordinate necessary services.</P>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Educational"></a> 
 <H3>Educational Implications</H3> 
 

<P>In the past, students with severe and/or multiple disabilities were routinely excluded from public schools. Since the implementation of Public Law 94-142 (the Education of the Handicapped Act, now called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA), public schools now serve large numbers of students with severe and/or multiple disabilities. Educational programming is likely to begin as early as infancy. At that time, as well as later on, the primary focus is upon increasing the child's independence.</P>

<P>In order to be effective, educational programs need to incorporate a variety of components to meet the considerable needs of individuals with severe and/or multiple disabilities. Programs should access needs in four major areas: domestic, leisure/recreational, community and vocational. These assessments enable the identification of functional objectives (objectives which will result in the learner's increased skill and independence in dealing with the routine activities of his/her life). instruction should include: Expression of choice; communication; functional skill development; and age-appropriate social skills training.</P>

<P>Related services are of great importance, and the multidisciplinary approach is crucial. Appropriate people such as speech and language therapists, physical and occupational therapists, and medical specialists need to work closely with classroom teachers and parents. Because of problems with skill generalization, related services are best offered during the natural routine in the school and community rather than removing a student from class for isolated therapy.</P>

<P>Frequently, classroom arrangements must take into consideration students' needs for medications, special diets, or special equipment. Adaptive aids and equipment enable students to increase their range of functioning. For example, in recent years computers have become effective communication devices. Other aides include: wheelchairs, typewriters, headsticks (head gear), clamps, modified handles on cups and silverware, and communication boards. Computerized communication equipment and specially built vocational equipment also play important roles in adapting working environments for people with serious movement limitations.</P>

<P>Integration with nondisabled peers is another important component of the educational setting. Attending the same school and participating in the same activities as their nondisabled peers is crucial to the development of social skills and friendships for people with severe disabilities. Integration also benefits nondisabled peers and professionals through positive attitude change.</P>

<P>Beginning as early as the elementary school years, community-based instruction is an important characteristic of educational programming. In order to increase the student's ability to generalize (transfer) skills to appropriate situations, this type of instruction takes place in the actual setting where the skills will be used. As students grow older, increasing time is spent in the community; high school students may spend as much as 90 percent of their day there. Programs should draw on existing adult services in the community, including group homes, vocational programs and recreational settings.</P>

<P>In light of the current Vocational Rehabilitation Act and the practice of supported employment, schools are now using school-to-work transition planning and working toward job placement in integrated, competitive settings rather than sheltered employment and day activity centers.</P>

<P>CLEVELAND, July 23 /PRNewswire/ -- If a student's vision doesn't meet the grade, his or her performance in school may not be a true indicator of academic capabilities. Give your children a head start in school this year with a vision check, free of charge, at the fourth annual All American Eye Check Day, on Sunday, August 4,  from noon to 4 p.m, at more than 700 Sears locations across the country. No appointment is necessary. The screening takes five to seven minutes to complete and is open to adults as well as children.</P>

<P>For children as young as 2-1/2, the Lea Symbols Test, will be used to measure sharpness of near and far vision. Developed by Finnish ophthalmologist Lea Hyvarinen, M.D., an international specialist in visual assessment of children, the Lea Symbols Test creates a play situation by using familiar shapes -- a circle, a square, a house and a heart -- instead of letters of the alphabet.</P>

<P>For older children and adults, the Snellen chart (E-chart) will be used to measure sharpness of distance vision. The Near Vision Reader Card will be used to check near vision.</P>

<P>A vision check is a good first step in protecting eye health and preventing unnecessary blindness. Further visual evaluation and a comprehensive eye examination are recommended when the check indicates a possible vision problem.</P>

<P>"Through these vision checks, we can detect vision problems in a substantial number of people who do not realize they are having a vision problem," said Dr. Michael Cohen, Sears Optical director of professional services. "Children particularly don't know when they aren't seeing properly."</P>

<P>According to Prevent Blindness America, the nation's leading volunteer eye </P>health and safety organization, the following are signs of possible eye trouble in children*:

<H4>Behavior</H4>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Rubs eyes excessively.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Shuts or covers one eye.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Tilts or thrusts head forward.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Has difficulty with reading or other close-up work.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Holds objects close to eyes.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Blinks more than usual or is irritable when doing close-up work.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Is unable to see distant things clearly.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Squints eyelids together or frowns.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<H4>Appearance</H4>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Crossed or misaligned eyes<BR><BR>

	<LI>Red-rimmed, encrusted or swollen eyelids.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Inflamed or watery eyes.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Recurring styes (infections) on eyelids.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Color photos of eyes show white reflection instead of typical red or no reflection.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<H4>Complaints</H4>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Eyes itch, burn or feel scratchy.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Cannot see well.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Dizziness, headaches or nausea following close-up work.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Blurred or double vision.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>If a child exhibits one or more of these signs, seek professional eye care.</P>

<P>All American Eye Check Day ushers in National Eye Exam Month, an educational and philanthropic effort sponsored by Sears Optical and Prevent Blindness, during which many independent Doctors of Optometry associated with Seers donate to Prevent Blindness' sightsaving programs. Additionally, Sears will donate $1 for every screening performed this year to support the sightsaving programs of Prevent Blindness America. National Eye Exam Month donations during the last seven years have totaled more than one million dollars.</P>

<P>For free information on a broad range of eye health and safety issues, consumers can call Prevent Blindness America's toll free number, 1-800-331-2020, during regular business hours or visit them on the World Wide Web at http://www.prevent-blindness.org, their Internet address.</P>

<P>ST. LOUIS, July 18 /PRNewswire/ -- More than 4 million people in the United States and Canada are in the care of an orthodontist and looking forward to a beautiful, healthy smile that's good for life. The obvious potential reward is straighter teeth that are less prone to decay  and injury. But just as important is the boost to self-confidence that a better smile can provide.</P>

<P>As you prepare to make decisions about orthodontics, it's very important to be armed with the facts. Here's a checklist of what to keep in mind:</P>

<H4>Why is orthodontics important?</H4>

<P>Orthodontics can boost a person's self-image as the teeth, jaws and lips become properly aligned, but an attractive smile is just one of the benefits. Alleviating or preventing physical health problems is just as important.</P>

<P>Without treatment, orthodontic problems may lead to tooth decay, gum disease, bone destruction and chewing and digestive difficulties. A
"bad bite" can contribute to speech impairments, tooth loss, chipped teeth, and other dental Injuries.</P>

<P>When should my child first see an orthodontist?
The AAO recommends that every child should see an orthodontist no later than age 7. In some cases, this could be as young as 2 or 3,</P>

<P>Many orthodontic problems are easier to correct if detected early rather than waiting until jaw growth has slowed. Early treatment may mean a patient will avoid surgery or other more serious corrections later in life.</P>

<H4>Is it ever too late for a person to get braces?</H4>

<P>No. Because healthy teeth can be moved at any age, an orthodontist can improve the smile of practically anyone -- in fact, orthodontists regularly treat patients in their 5Os, 60s and older!</P>

<H4>What makes an orthodontist different from a dentist?</H4>

<P>Orthodontists are the dental specialists who correct dental and facial irregularities, day in and day out. An orthodontist is expert at moving teeth, helping jaws develop properly and working with the patient to help make sure the teeth stay in their new positions.</P>

<P>AAO members are uniquely qualified to correct "bad bites." The American Dental Association requires orthodontists to have at least two years of post-doctoral, advanced specialty training in orthodontics in an accredited program, after graduation from college and then dental school.</P>

<H4>What about costs?</H4>

<P>This will vary, of course, depending on the nature of the problem. Many orthodontic problems require only limited treatment. You may be surprised to discover that orthodontics is less expensive than you thought.</P>

<P>Your orthodontist will be happy to discuss fees. He or she may offer payment plans to help meet individual financial needs. In addition, many dental insurance plans now include orthodontic benefits. Of course, it's important to keep in mind the lifetime value that Orthodontics provides.</P>

<H4>Should I ask to talk to present and/or former patients?</H4>

<P>It is wise for a consumer to investigate the value of any product or service. Most orthodontic patients will give it to you straight- orthodontics is one of the best investments they've ever made. Better self-esteem and better oral health are benefits that can last a lifetime.</P>

<P>An AAO member will be glad to have you talk to current or former patients, who can tell you firsthand how braces have improved their lives.</P>

<H4>Who can recommend an orthodontist?</H4>

<P>Ask your family dentist to recommend an orthodontist. You also can find the names of AAO members in your area simply by calling a toll-free number, 1-800-STRAIGHT (l-800-787-2444). Or write the American Association of Orthodontists at 401 N. Lindbergh Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63141-7816.</P>

<P>Anyone considering orthodontics for themselves or a child can take advantage of the "Smile Bank," the AAO's free computer-imaging program. Just send in a close-up photo with a big, toothy smile and an orthodontist will prepare a computer-generated "after braces" picture. Mail your photo (and return address) to the American Association of Orthodontists, c/o "SMILES," and you'll receive a free photo showing how your smile might benefit from orthodontic treatment.</P>

<P>CONTACT: Bill Beggs of Hughes Public Relations, 314-721-3400; or Larry Mickey of the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO), 314-993-1700</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Kraft Foods, Inc. of
Northfield, Ill., is announcing a voluntary in-store recall
and safety advisory for approximately 678,000 sets of
Chillers Sticks distributed in connection with a Jell-O
instant pudding promotion. The plastic Chillers Sticks may
break, presenting a choking hazard to young children.</P>
<P>     Kraft has received 71 reports of the Chillers Sticks
breaking. Kraft is not aware of any injuries. This recall is
being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury.</P>
<P>     The red or purple Chillers Sticks, measuring three
inches long, are used to make frozen Jell-O Pudding treats.
An outside supplier manufactured the sticks, which were
packaged in sets of six. Kraft distributed the sticks
nationwide through an 800-number and supermarkets from early
June through mid-July 1996 as part of a promotion for Jell-O
pudding.</P>
<P>     Consumers should immediately discard the Chillers
Sticks. If consumers need further information, they should
call Kraft at (800) 433-9363. Kraft Foods has recalled the
Chillers Sticks from store shelves and will no longer
distribute the sticks.</P>
<P>     All Jell-O Instant Pudding mix is safe and is not
affected by this recall. Jell-O Instant Pudding recipes can
be prepared and consumed without Chillers Sticks.</P>
<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death from
15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on
CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800)
638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To
order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301)
504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the
release number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall
information at CPSC's web site at http://www.cpsc.gov or via
Internet gopher services at cpsc.gov. Consumers can report
product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</P>

<P>The Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Window Covering
Safety Council are joining with major manufacturers, importers,
and retailers across the United States to warn parents and
caregivers that young children can become entangled and strangle
in pull cords for window coverings. CPSC is aware of at least 140
deaths since 1981. With the continuing number of strangulation
deaths, CPSC is re-issuing this warning which was first issued in
1985.</P>

<P>Window covering cords are one of the products most frequently
associated with strangulation of children under five. The younger
victims, usually between 10 to 15 months of age, typically are in
cribs which have been placed near window covering pull cords.
Although a few older children, usually from two to four years
old, find cords hanging near the floor, most of these victims
become entangled in cords while climbing on furniture to look out
the window. Entanglement and strangulation can occur when a child
is alone in a room for only a short time.</P>

<P>The Commission and the Window Covering Safety Council urge
parents to eliminate the loop in two-corded horizontal blinds,
and pleated and cellular shades by using any of the following
technical fixes:</P>

<H4>Horizontal Blinds</H4>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Cut the cord above the tassel, remove the equalizer buckle, and
	add a separate tassel at the end of each cord, or<BR><BR>

	<LI>Cut the cord above the tassel, remove the equalizer buckle, and
	add a breakaway tassel which will separate if a child becomes
	entangled in the loop.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<H4>Pleated or Cellular Shades</H4>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Leave the cord stop near the headrail in place. Cut the cord
above the tassel and add a separate tassel at the end of each
cord. Warning: When shades are raised, a loop will appear above
the cord stop. Keep cord out of the reach of children.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<H4>Vertical Blinds, Continuous Loop Systems, and Drapery Cords</H4>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> Install a cord tie-down device. Permanently attach and use the
tiedown to floor, wall, or window jamb.<BR><BR>

<LI> Keep all window covering cords out of the reach of children.
Unless the cords can be completely removed from a child's reach,
including when a child climbs on furniture, CPSC recommends
against knotting or tying the cords together which creates a new
loop for a child to become entangled.<BR><BR>

<LI> Replacement safety tassels are available free of charge at
window covering retailers. Consumers can call (800) 506-4636 to
find the location of the nearest store or to order free tassels.<BR><BR>

<LI> CPSC also recommends that when you install window coverings,
adjust the cords to their shortest length possible. When you
order new custom window coverings, specify that you want a short
cord.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>To report incidents or injuries relating to a consumer product,
consumers should call the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission's toll-free hotline number at (800) 638-2772. A
teletypewriter for the hearing impaired is available at (800)
638-8270. Consumers can obtain recall information and report
product hazards by the INTERNET at info @cpsc.gov.</P>

<P>No parent likes to have to choose drug therapy for their child. As anxious as parents and teachers are to get children's behavior and learning on track, drug therapy has a major drawback -- it's not addressing the cause of the problem. Many experts believe there may be various causes. Until we know exactly what they are, looking at what triggers attention, behavior and learning problems is important. Parents all over the world have noted that certain environmental agents can trigger their children's symptoms. For many families, managing the symptoms lies in making some changes in diet.</P>

<P>How many children fit into this group? One double blind, placebo-controlled study of children with ADHD who also had signs of allergy showed that 73% responded favorably to treatment with a multiple-item elimination diet. (Boris and Mandel, Annals of Allergy, May 1994.)</P>

<P>If you think your child does not have allergies, consider that allergy can show up as ear infections, nasal symptoms, skin rashes, red ears or cheeks, puffiness or circles under the eyes, gastro-intestinal problems, asthma or frequent upper respiratory infections.</P>

<P>The Feingold Association can help determine if food chemicals and natural salicylates are a trigger of behavior, learning or attention problems. They are a world-wide, nonprofit organization, dedicated to helping people know if there is a connection for them or their child with symptoms of:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B>ADD, ADHD,</B>
	<LI><B>Learning Disabilities and</B>
	<LI><B>PDD (Pervasive Developmental Delay) and Autism </B>
</UL>

<P>They also assist people in determining</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B>sensitivities to natural salicylates (a relative of aspirin) </B>
</UL>
<P>and help people to make the transition to foods without certain chemicals.</P>

<P>The Feingold Programs has as its foundation an elimination diet developed by Ben F. Feingold, MD in the 1970's at Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in San Francisco. Dr. Feingold, noted pediatrician and allergist, pioneered this work linking behavior, attention and learning problems in children to the ingestion of natural or synthetic chemicals.</P>

<P>The Feingold Program is the choosing of products and foods without synthetic (artificial) colors, synthetic (artificial) flavors, antioxidant preservatives BHA, BHT, &amp; TBHQ and, for a trial period, foods which contain natural salicylates (such as apples,oranges &amp; tomatoes) and aspirin and medication containing aspirin.</P>

<P>After a favorable response, the salicylate-containing foods and medications can be added back into the diet one at a time and any reactions noted.</P>

<P>Support groups of parents who saw a difference in their children sprang up around the world after his book <I>Why Your Child is Hyperactive</I> was published in 1975. These organizations exist today as the Feingold Associations of the United States.</P>

<H3>Who supports the diet-behavior connection?</H3>

<P>Published Research supports it:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>"Dietary factors may plan a significant role in the the etiology of the majority of children with ADHD", Boris and Mandel, Annals of Allergy, May 1994. "...the suggestion that diet may contribute to behavior disorders in children must be taken seriously." Egger, et al, Lancet, March 9, 1985.<BR><BR>

	<LI>"These results suggest that pediatricians and other practitioners might consider dietary modification worth trying, particularly in younger children." Kaplan et al, Journal of Pediatrics, 83 (January 1989), pp. 7-17.<BR><BR>

	<LI>"This study demonstrated a functional relation between the ingestion of a synthetic food color (tartrazine) and behavioral change..." Rowe and Rowe, Journal of Pediatrics, 125 (November 1994) pp. 691-8. <BR><BR>
	<LI>For a complete bibliography on ADD, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to the Feingold Association, Bibliography (indicates ADD or autism) 127 E. Main St., Riverhead, NY 11901<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>Parents who have seen it work support it: </P>
<P>For over two decades families and thousands of people of all ages have been dramatically helped by this program. Many have been able to eliminate or reduce medication, including Ritalin and other amphetamine-like drugs.</P>

<P>The Feingold Program is made easier to use by the Feingold Association of the United States through the excellent materials it provides and the help it offers from families who are using it. Updates to the product lists are made through the newsletter which also reports on the breaking research in the areas of ADD, ADHD, autism and other developmental delays. The Programs are based on published research and the reported results in the homes of thousands of families.</P>

<P>Believed to be on the same continuum as ADD/ADHD are PDD (Pervasive Developmental Delay) and Autistic-like symptoms. The rates of diagnosed PDD and Autism are increasing an an alarming rate. For some, a metabolic connection has been found.</P>

<P>The Feingold Association's Autism, Intolerance and Allergy Program can help parents become "detectives" in tracking down biochemical connections to autistic-like behavior. They work with the leading doctors world wide involved in this cutting edge research. Many families report a decrease in symptoms when they follow the Autism, Intolerance and Allergy (AIA) Program. The following are symptoms that are addressed by the AIA Program. Please note: All children exhibit these at one time or another. It is the persistence and the intensity that are cause for concern. Check with your doctor.</P>

<P>How can a child learn and not learn at the same time?  Why
do some students apply little or no effort to school tasks
while they commit considerable time and effort to demanding, creative activities outside of school?  These behaviors
are typical of some students who are simultaneously gifted
and learning disabled.  For many people, however, the
terms learning disabilities  and giftedness  are at opposite
ends of a learning continuum.  In some states, because of
funding regulations, a student may be identified and assisted with either learning disabilities or giftedness, but not
both.</P>
        
<P>Uneasiness in accepting this seeming contradiction in
terms stems primarily from faulty and incomplete understandings.  This is not surprising, because the "experts" in
each of these disciplines have difficulty reaching agreement.  Some still believe that giftedness is equated with
outstanding achievement across all subject areas.  Thus, a
student who is an expert on bugs at age 8 may automatically be excluded from consideration for a program for
gifted students because he cannot read, though he can
name and classify a hundred species of insects.  Many educators view below-grade-level achievement as a prerequisite to a diagnosis of a learning disability.  Thus, an extremely bright student who is struggling to stay on grade
level, may slip through the cracks of available services because he or she is not failing.</P>

<a name="Who"></a>
<H3>Who Are The Learning Disabled/Gifted?</H3>
<P>Recent advances in both fields have alerted professionals
to the possibility that both sets of behavior can exist simultaneously (Baum and Owen, 1988; Fox, Brody, and Tobin,
1983; Whitmore and Maker, 1985).  Children who are both
gifted and learning disabled exhibit remarkable talents or
strengths in some areas and disabling weaknesses in
others.  They can be grouped into three categories: </P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>identified gifted students who have subtle learning disabilities, <BR><BR>
	<LI>unidentified students whose gifts and disabilities
	may be masked by average achievement, and <BR><BR>
	<LI> identified learning disabled students who are also gifted.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>Identified gifted students who have subtle learning disabilities.  This group is easily identified as gifted because of
high achievement or high IQ scores.  As they grow older,
discrepancies widen between expected and actual performance.  These students may impress teachers with their
verbal abilities, while their spelling or handwriting contradicts the image.  At times, they may be forgetful, sloppy
and disorganized.  In middle school or junior high, where
there are more long-term written assignments and a heavier emphasis on comprehensive, independent reading,
some bright students find it increasingly difficult to achieve.
Concerned adults are convinced that if these students
would only try harder, they could succeed.</P>
<P>        While increased effort may be required for these students, the real issue is that they simply do not know how!
Because they may be on grade level and are considered
gifted, they are likely to be overlooked for screening procedures necessary to identify a subtle learning disability.
Identification of a subtle disability would help students understand why they are experiencing academic difficulties.
More important, professionals could offer learning strategies and compensation techniques to help them deal with
their duality of learning behaviors.</P>
<P>        A word of caution is necessary at this point.  A learning
disability is not the only cause of a discrepancy between
potential and achievement.  There are a number of other
reasons why bright children may be underachieving.
Perhaps expectations are unrealistic.  Excelling in science,
for example, is no assurance that high-level performance
will be shown in other academic areas.  Motivation, interest,
and specific aptitudes influence the amount of energy stu- dents are willing to apply to a given task.  Social or emotional problems can interfere with achievement.  Grades
and school are simply unimportant to some students.
Some youngsters have not learned how to study because,
during primary grades, school was easy and success required minimal effort.</P>

<P>Unidentified students.  The second group of youngsters in
which this combination of learning behaviors may be found
are those who are not noticed at all.  These students are
struggling to stay at grade level.  Their superior intellectual
ability is working overtime to help compensate for weaknesses caused by an undiagnosed learning disability.  In
essence, their gift masks the disability and the disability
masks the gift.  These students are often difficult to find
because they  do not flag the need for attention by exceptional behavior.  Their hidden talents and abilities may
emerge in specific content areas or may be stimulated by a
classroom teacher who uses a creative approach to learning.  The disability is frequently discovered in college or
adulthood when the student happens to read about
dyslexia or hears peers describe their learning difficulties.</P>

<P>Identified learning disabled students who are also gifted.
These bright children, discovered within the population of
students who are identified as learning disabled, are often
failing miserably in school.  They are first noticed because
of  what they cannot do, rather than because to the talent
they are demonstrating.  This group of students is most at
risk because of the implicit message that accompanies the
LD categorization that there is something wrong with the
student that must be fixed before anything else can happen.  Parents and teachers alike become totally focused
on the problem.  Little attention, if any, is paid to the student's strengths and interests, other than to use them to
remediate weaknesses.</P>
<P>        Interestingly, these children often have high-level interests at home.  They may build fantastic structures with
plastic bricks or start a local campaign to save the whales.
The creative abilities, intellectual strength and passion they
bring to their hobbies are clear indicators of their potential
for giftedness (Renzulli, 1978).  Because these students
are bright and sensitive, they are more acutely aware of
their difficulty in learning.  Furthermore, they tend to generalize their feelings of academic failure to an overall sense
of inadequacy.  Over time, these pessimistic feelings overshadow any positive feelings connected with what they accomplish on their own at home.  Research has shown that
this group of students is often rated by teachers as most
disruptive at school.  They are frequently found to be off
task; they may act out, daydream, or complain of
headaches and stomachaches; and they are easily frustrated and use their creative abilities to avoid tasks ( Baum
and Owen, 1988; Whitmore, 1980).  Since school does
not offer these bright youngsters much opportunity to
polish and use their gifts, such results are not surprising.</P>

<a name="Curricular"></a>
<H3>Curricular Needs</H3>
<P>Although each of these subgroups has unique problems,
they all require an environment that will nurture their gifts,
attend to the learning disability and provide the emotional
support to deal with their inconsistent abilities.  Four general guidelines can assist professionals in developing programs that will meet the needs of these students.</P>

<P>Focus attention on the development of the gift.
Remediation of basic skills historically has been the single
focus of efforts to serve students once they have been
classified as learning disabled.  Few opportunities exist for
bright students with learning disabilities to demonstrate
gifted behaviors.  Research has shown that a focus on
weaknesses at the expense of developing gifts can result
in poor self esteem, a lack of motivation, depression and
stress (Baum, 1984; Whitmore &amp; Maker, 1985).  In addition
to offering remediation, focused attention on the development of strengths, interests, and superior intellectual capacities is necessary.  The students need a stimulating ed-
ucational environment which will enable them to fully develop their talents and abilities.  Enrichment activities
should be designed to circumvent problematic weaknesses and to highlight abstract thinking and creative production.</P>
<P>        Over the last 6 years, the state of Connecticut has
funded a variety of special programs for gifted students
who have learning disabilities.  All the programs have emphasized the development of gifts and talents of these
students.  The results of the projects showed dramatic improvement in student self-esteem, motivation, and productive learning behaviors. Improved achievement in basic
skills for many students has been an unexpected bonus
(Baum, 1988).  In fact, according to Whitmore and Maker
(1985), more gains are seen when intervention focuses on
the gift rather than the disability.</P>

<P>Provide a nurturing environment that values individual differences.  According to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
(1962), individuals must feel like they belong and are valued in order to reach their potential or self-actualize.  How
valued can a student feel if the curriculum must be continually modified, or assignments watered down, to enable
the student to achieve success?  Currently, only certain
abilities are rewarded by schools, primarily those that involve strong verbal proficiency.  Indeed, according to
Howard Gardner (1983), schools spend much of their time
teaching students the skills they would need to become
college professors.  Success in the real world depends on
skills or knowledge in other areas besides reading and
writing.</P>
<P>        A nurturing environment - one that shows concern for
developing student potential - values and respects individual differences. Students are rewarded for what they do
well.  Options are offered for both acquiring information
and communicating what is learned.  The philosophy fosters and supports interdependence; students work in cooperative groups to achieve goals.  Multiple intelligences
are acknowledged; A well-produced video production
about life in the Amazon is as valued as the well written essay on the same topic.  In such an environment no child will
feel like a second class citizen, and the gifted students with
learning disabilities can excel.</P>

<P>Encourage compensation strategies.  Learning disabilities
tend to be somewhat permanent.  A poor speller will always
need to check for errors in spelling before submitting a final
draft.  Students who have difficulty memorizing mathematics may need to use a calculator to assure accuracy.  Thus,
simply remediating weaknesses may not be appropriate or
sufficient for the gifted learning disabled student.
Remediation will make the learner somewhat more proficient, but probably not excellent, in areas of weakness.
For instance, students who have difficulty with handwriting
will ultimately fare much better if allowed to use a computer
to record their ideas on paper than they will after years of
remediation in handwriting.  The following list outlines suggestions for providing compensation techniques to assist
the student in coping with problematic weaknesses typical
of the learning disabled student:</P>
<Ol Type=1>
<LI>     Find sources of information that are appropriate for
students who may have difficulty reading.  Some examples are visitations, interviews, photographs, pictorial
histories, films, lectures, or experimentation.
Remember, these children do not want the curriculum
to be less challenging or demanding.  Rather, they
need alternative ways to receive the information.<BR><BR>

<LI>     Provide advanced organizers to help students receive
and communicate information.  Students who have difficulty organizing and managing time also benefit from
receiving outlines of class lectures, study guides, and
a syllabus of topics to be covered.  Teach students
who have difficulty transferring ideas to a sequential
format on paper to use brainstorming and webbing to
generate outlines and organize written work.  Provide
management plans in which tasks are listed sequentially with target dates for completion.  Finally, provide a
structure or visual format to guide the finished product.
A sketch of an essay or science project board will enable these students to produce a well-organized product.<BR><BR>

<LI>      Use technology to promote productivity.  Technology
has provided efficient means to organize and access
information, increase accuracy in mathematics and
spelling, and enhance the visual quality of the finished
product.  In short, it allows students with learning disabilities to hand in work of which they can feel proud.
Preventing these students from using word processing programs to complete all written assignments is like
prohibiting blind children from using texts printed in
braille!<BR><BR>

<LI>      Offer a variety of options for communication of ideas.
Writing is not the only way to communicate;  all learning
can be expressed and applied in a variety of modes.
Slides, models, speeches, mime, murals, and film productions are examples.  Remember, however, to offer
these options to all children.  Alternate modes should
be the rule rather than the exception.<BR><BR>

<LI>      Help students who have problems in short-term memory develop strategies for remembering.  The use of
mnemonics, especially those created by students
themselves, is one effective strategy to enhance
memory.  Visualization techniques have also proved to
be effective.  Resources are listed at the end of this digest.<BR><BR>
</OL>
<P>Encourage awareness of individual strengths and weaknesses.  It is imperative that students who are gifted and
learning disabled understand their abilities, strengths, and
weaknesses so that they can make intelligent choices
about their future.  If a goal that is important to such a students will require extensive reading, and, if reading is a
weak area, the student will have to acknowledge the role of
effort and the need for assistance to achieve success.
"Rap" sessions, in which these students can discuss their
frustrations and learn how to cope with their strange mix of
abilities and disabilities, are helpful.  Mentoring experiences with adults who are gifted and learning disabled will
lend validity to the belief that such individuals can succeed.</P>

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>In the final analysis, students who are both gifted and
learning disabled must learn how to be their own advocates.  They must ultimately choose careers that will accentuate their strengths.  In doing so they will meet others who
think, feel, and create as they do.</P>
<P>        One such student, after years of feeling different and
struggling to succeed, was finally able to make appropriate
decisions about what he truly needed in his life.  He was an
outstanding amateur photographer who loved music.  He
had also started several "businesses" during his teenage
years.  In his junior year at college he became depressed
and realized that he was totally dissatisfied with his coursework, peers, and instructors.  He wondered whether he should quit school.  After all, he was barely earning C's in
his courses.  His advisor suggested that he might like to
create his own major, perhaps in the business of art.  That
was the turning point in this young man's life.  For the first
time since primary grades, he began to earn A's in his
courses.  He related that he finally felt worthwhile.  "You
know," he said, "finally I'm wit people who think like me and
have my interests and values.  I am found!"</P>

<P>The challenge of identifying gifted children and providing them with 
appropriate educational services is particularly complex when they are
recent immigrants to the United States.  Linguistic and cultural 
backgrounds, economic and attitudinal factors, sociocultural 
peer-group expectations, cross-cultural stress, and intergenerational 
conflict may all influence efforts to recognize and provide 
appropriate learning opportunities.  Although immigrant groups are 
culturally diverse, they share some unique challenges when interfacing
with the setting.</P>

<a name="Challenges"></a>
<H3>Challenges</H3>

<P><B>Linguistic.</B>  The process of second language acquisition is long, 
complex, and developmental.  Therefore, attempting to determine a 
child's intellectual  potential by using English-based assessment 
instruments can lead to erroneous conclusions.  In addition, 
assessment in English is more likely to reflect knowledge of English 
and interpretation of grammatical structure than general intellectual 
potential.</P>

<P><B>Cultural.</B>  Traditional customs and sex-role behaviors are likely to 
differ greatly from those encountered in the U. S. (Sheehy, 1986; 
Goffin, 1988).  Cultural differences in learning styles, listening 
behaviors (Trueba, 1983), and response patterns (Harris, 1988; Cohen, 
1988) often underlie misinterpreted messages.  </P>

<P><B>Economic.</B>  Recent immigrants may be economically poor; parents may be 
supporting households both here and in their native country (National 
Coalition of Advocates for Students, 1988).  Families may be large; 
older school age children may need to work after school or miss school
to earn money.</P>

<P>"Hidden" factors such as illegal immigrant status, limited knowledge 
about accessing social and health care services, neglect of basic 
health needs (Clark, 1988, October), and physical and psychological 
problems caused by the political environment in the native country 
(National Coalition of Advocates for Students, 1988) may also impede 
educational progress.</P>

<P><B>Attitudinal.</B>  Immigrants may demonstrate a very positive attitude 
towards schools and learning.  However, they may experience feelings 
of guilt for family members who had to remain behind, or who were hurt
or killed in their native country.  A gifted child's heightened 
awareness may increase vulnerability when such circumstances exist.</P>

<P>When a parent or relative is an illegal immigrant the child may fear 
authority figures (Gratz &amp; Pulley, 1984; Portes, McLeod &amp; Parker, 
1978; Vasquez, 1988), thereby preventing them from forming close 
relationships with teachers and other potentionally helpful adults.</P>

<P><B>Sociocultural and Peer Expectations.</B>  Racial or ethnic conflict, 
concern for personal safety, or conflicting peer expectations may 
cause tension and interfere with or redirect the child's natural 
curiosity and innate love of learning.</P>

<P><B>Cross-Cultural.</B>  Cross-cultural challenges are confusing and may delay
the development of a child's sense of self-identity.  Continuing 
cross-cultural stress is often difficult for immigrants to articulate.</P>

<P><B>Intergenerational.</B>  Immigrant children often serve as "interpreters" 
for the family, and as the children become Americanized they may begin
to resent this responsibility, subsequently seen by elders as 
disassociating with tradition.  Resultant coping strategies have a 
negative effect on self-concept and family relationships (Harris, 
1988).  </P>

<P><B>School System. </B> A student may have little, sporadic, or possibly no 
schooling prior to arriving in the U. S.  Wei (1983) reported the 
frequency of wrong dates of birth in school records, a face saving 
scheme to hide facts about lack of schooling (Center for Educational 
Research and Innovation, 1987; Vuong, 1988).</P>

<P>Crowded classrooms, staff opposition to special programs, and use of 
standardized tests may preclude entrance of recent immigrant children 
into gifted programs.  Steinberg and Halsted (National Coalition of 
Advocates for Students, 1988) reported that immigrant children have 
often been tracked into English as a Second Language programs, then 
steered towards vocational courses.</P>

<P>Misplacement may occur if gifted students with disabilities are 
classified solely in terms of their disabilities (Poplin &amp; Wright, 
1983), a problem not confined to immigrants.  Parents of immigrant 
children may distrust any "special" classes, including classes for 
gifted and talented (Wei, 1983).</P>

<P> A disproportionate number of immigrants have been referred for 
psychological services (Sugai and Maheady, 1988) when their behavior 
was misinterpreted and labeled as adjustment or achievement problems 
(Trueba, 1983).  </P>

<H3>Strategies</H3>

<P>The following identification, service, and evaluation strategies may 
assist education professionals who want to meet the educational needs 
of immigrant children who are gifted.  </P>

<B>Linguistic</B>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>     Provide enrichment activities to students perceived "not 
	 ready" for gifted programs.<BR><BR>
	<LI>     Institute independent or small group research projects using 
	 native language references and resources.<BR><BR>
	<LI>     Help staff members become aware of different language 
	 structures.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<B>Cultural</B>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>      Explain the concept of gifted programs to parents in their 
	 native language.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Talk to parents in their native language to learn about 
	 aspects of giftedness valued by their culture.  <BR><BR>
	<LI>      Develop program services that are culturally sensitive and 
	 responsive.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<B>Economic</B>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>      Consider aspirations of the immigrant group; pay attention to 
	 variables such as the parents' occupation and education.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Work only from facts, assume nothing about the economic status
 or educational background of the family.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<B>Attitudinal</B>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>      Transmit a sense of self-reliance; use a biographical approach
	 concentrating on positive aspects of problem-solving, task commitment,
	 and decision making.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Encourage student involvement in publications or community 
	 programs.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Encourage journal writing and writing of stories and poems.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Provide opportunities for a peer support counseling group.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<B>Sociocultural and Peer Group Expectations</B>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>1.      Use narratives, role-playing, and bibliotherapy to model 
	 conflict resolution.<BR><BR>
	<LI>2.      Identify conflicting expectations, determine the causes, and 
	 provide intervention.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<B>Cross-Cultural</B>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>      Increase motivation for children to identify themselves as 
	 candidates for gifted programs by referring to the gifted program as 
	 an opportunity for students to work harder and learn more.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Use care in selecting staff responsible for identification.  
	 If possible, select staff members who are familiar with the child's 
	 culture, country, or region.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<B>Intergenerational</B>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>      Use nonverbal expressive arts to involve the family.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Use intra/intercultural peer referral as a source of 
	 identification.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Involve outreach workers for parents and other family members.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Use media services in the native language.  These services are
	 usually available through local agencies.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<B>School System</B>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>1.      Identify or place students according to educational background
	 and potential.<BR><BR>
	<LI>2.      Interpret the child's behavior in the context of the child's 
	 experiences (Ramirez, 1988).  <BR><BR>
	<LI>3.      Use extracurricular activities as part of the identification 
	 process; incorporate successful activities and areas of interest into 
	 learning goals.<BR><BR>
	<LI>4.      Ensure that the screening and selection committee has 
	 knowledge of creative production or performance in the respective 
	 culture.  Include representative community members on selection 
	 committees. Avoid using standard identification instruments.<BR><BR>
	<LI>5.      Assess from the perspective of individual learning styles.<BR><BR>
	<LI>6.      Place the child in a minimal stress, "culturally congruent" 
	 (Trueba, 1983, p.412) environment and observe for a period of time.<BR><BR>
	<LI>7.      Periodically, discuss attitudes and possible biases with 
	teachers.  Hold informal sessions to air problems and exchange ideas.<BR><BR>
	<LI>8.      Use a developmental rather than a crisis-oriented model.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>Both society and individuals benefit when a linguistically and 
culturally diverse population is tapped for talent potential.  Problem
areas must be defined in the light of specific cultures and culture 
differences.  Attention must be directed to problem-specific 
techniques to ensure correct placement and opportunities for 
appropriately differentiated learning experiences that are culturally 
sensitive.</P>

<P>/ADVANCE/ WASHINGTON, July 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorders (CH.A.D.D.), the national organization dedicated to bettering the lives of individuals with attention deficit disorders (ADD) and those who care for them, today called upon Congress to strengthen the Federal government's role in the research into the causes and treatment of ADD. CH.A.D.D. also urged the federal government to issue guidelines to help ensure the proper diagnosis of individuals with ADD.</P>

<P>CH.A.D.D. National President Mary McDonald Richard, testifying before the Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, outlined an agenda that will increase public understanding of ADD, assist clinicians to properly diagnose ADD, improve the effectiveness of treatment, and ensure that children with ADD are able to reach their inherent potential.</P>

<P>"It is essential for Congress to increase funding for research in order to learn more about ADD," Ms. Richard told the Subcommittee. "We encourage [the] National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to become active in assisting with the development of comprehensive diagnostic and assessment tools.</P>

<P>CH.A.D.D. emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive assessment process conducted by professionals who are qualified to diagnose ADD. However, CH.A.D.D. remains concerned about inaccurate diagnoses that may be made on the basis of inadequate evaluation procedures. "The establishment of [NIMH] guidelines would accomplish a great deal towards properly diagnosing cases of ADD."</P>

<P>Ms. Richard, herself the parent of two children with ADD, also told the Subcommittee that "much confusion still exists with regard to the obligation of schools to serve children with ADD under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973."</P>

<P>"On a daily basis, CH.A.D.D. receives calls from parents who are unable to obtain proper educational services for their children with ADD," Ms. Richard continued. "The Department of Education must ensure that no child with ADD who needs special education and related services goes unrecognized, unserved, and left to fail."</P>

<P>CH.A.D.D. has over 35,000 members and over 600 local chapters nationwide. CH.A.D.D. maintains a support network for parents of children with ADD provides a forum for continuing education of parents, professionals, and adults with ADD; acts as an information resource at the community level; advocates appropriate education services for children with ADD; and operates a toll-free phone line for information about ADD, 1-800-233-4050.</P>

<P>/ADVANCE/ BETHESDA, Nd., July 14 /PRNewswire/ -- Subtle structural abnormalities in the brain circuit that inhibits thoughts have been confirmed in the first comprehensive brain imaging study of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Difficulty staying mentally focused is a primary symptom of ADHD, which affects about 5 percent of school age children. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of 57 boys with AOHD, aged 5-18, also revealed that their brains were more symmetrical than those of 55 age-matched controls. F. Xavier Castellanos, M.D., of the National Institute of Mental Health and colleagues report on their findings in the July issue of the "Archives of General Psychiatry."</P>

<P>Three structures in the affected circuit on the right side of the brain -- prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus and globus pallidus -- were smaller than normal in the boys with ADHD, when examined as a group. The prefrontal cortex, located in the frontal lobe Just behind the forehead, is believed to serve as the brain's command center. The caudate nucleus and globus pallidus, located near the middle of the brain, translate the commands into action. "If the prefrontal cortex is the steering wheel, the caudate and globus are the accelerator and brakes," explained Castellanos. "And it's this braking or inhibitory function that is likely impaired in ADHD. ADHD is thought to be rooted in an inability to inhibit thoughts. Finding smaller right hemisphere brain structures responsible for such "executive" functions strengthens support for this hypothesis.</P>

<P>The NIMH researchers also found that the entire right cerebral hemispheres in boys with ADHD were, on average, 5.2% smaller than those of controls. The right side of the brain is normally larger than the left. Hence, the ADHD children, as a group, had abnormally symmetrical brains.</P>

<P>Although the same brain circuit had been implicated earlier, Castellanos and colleagues examined a dozen times more brain areas in a three-fold larger sample than had been studied previously.</P>

<P>"These subtle differences, discernible when comparing group data, hold promise as telltale markers for future family, genetic and treatment studies of ADHD." said Judith Rapoport, M.D., senior author on the paper and chief of the NIMH Child Psychiatry branch. However, because of normal genetic variation in brain structure, MRI scans cannot be used to definitively diagnose the disorder in any given individual.'</P>

<P>The newly confirmed markers may provide clues about the causes of ADHD. The investigators found a significant correlation between decreased normal asymmetry of the caudate nucleus and histories of prenatal, perinatal and birth complications, leading them to speculate that events in the womb may affect the normal development of brain asymmetry and may underlie ADHD. Since there is evidence for a genetic component in at least some cases of ADHD, factors such as a predisposition to prenatal viral infections could be involved, said Dr. Rapoport.</P>

<P>The NIMH researchers are currently following up on a recent discovery of a link between ADHD and a gene variant known to code for a particular receptor subtype for the neurotransmitter dopamine. "We want to see the extent to which children with this gene variant also have thebrain structural abnormalities revealed in this study," said Dr. Castellanos. The researchers are currently extending confirmation of the markers in girls as well as boys who have not been exposed to medication. They are also using functional MRI scanning to visualize brain activity in ADHD.</P>

<P>Other NIMH researchers participating in the study were: Jay Giedd, M.D., Wendy Marsh, Susan Hamburger, Catherine Vaituzis, Yolanda Vauss, Debra Kaysen, Amy Krain, Gail Ritchie, and Jagath Rajapakse. Also participating were: Daniel Dickstein, Brown, U., Stacey Sarfatti, U. of Pennsylvania John Snell, Ph.D., U. of Virginia; and Nicholas Lange, Ph.D., National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.</P>

<P>The National Institute Of Mental Health is a component of the NIH, an agency of the U.S. Public Health Service, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</P>

<P>COLUMBUS, Ohio, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- CompuServe Incorporated (Nasdaq: CSRV) and Henter-Joyce, Inc., St. Petersburg, Florida, have agreed to work together on a solution that updates accessibility to the CompuServe(R) Information Service and the Internet by visually impaired members.</P>

<P>"As information technology continues to move forward, adaptive equipment and technology must change to keep pace," said Kent Stuckey, CompuServe director, business Development. With CompuServe moving to a non-ASCII, more graphics-rich environment and adopting Internet standards, the company chose to work with Henter-Joyce to ensure that members who are blind or visually impaired can use the same computer and interface software enjoyed by sighted household members, and thereby continue to benefit from the online experience.</P>

<P>"Henter-Joyce welcomes the opportunity to join CompuServe in providing today's technology to all visually impaired individuals wishing to participate in the online world. With the combination of our two companies' products, they can do so using their own or their family's home computer," said Eric Damery, vice president of sales for Henter-Joyce.</P>

<P>During the third quarter of this year (July - Sept.), the two organizations will offer a package that includes Henter-Joyce's JAWS for Windows screen reader, CompuServe's interface software for the Windows operating system and a set of training audio tapes to help instruct the visually impaired user on the use of CompuServe as well as the screen reader. To order the package, call 800-336-5658 or send electronic mail inquiries to info@hj.com. Henter-Joyce maintains e Forum(R) area on the CompuServe information Service et GO JAWS.</P>

<P>"Cyberspace is a world where people interact with one another beyond their physical limitations," Stuckey added. "The online world comes to them, wherever they are, whenever they want it, without regard to physical barriers. Cyberspace allows them to do research, work, learn, share their experiences and socialize with people around the world."</P>

<P>In addition to thousands of online news, information, communication and entertainment areas, CompuServe offers Forum areas of particular benefit to people with disabilities, including the Disability Forum (GO DISABILITIES), the Handicapped Users Database (GO HANDICAPPED) and technical support Forum areas for providers of software tools and other adaptive equipment.</P>

<P>"While the Windows operating system can present technical challenges for users with disabilities and for accessibility software developers, it has proven to be where the computer world of today and tomorrow is going, and Henter-Joyce intends to be there every step of the way," Damery added.</P>

<P>Founded in 1987, Henter-Joyce develops software that enables people with visual impairments to make computers talk.</P>

<P>     The surface under and around playground equipment can be a
major factor in determining the injury-causing potential of a
fall. It is self evident that a fall onto a shock absorbing
surface is less likely to cause a serious injury than a fall onto
a hard surface.  Because head impact injuries from a fall have
the potential for being life threatening, the more shock
absorbing a surface can be made, the more is the likelihood that
the severity of the injury will be reduced. However, it should be
recognized that all injuries due to falls cannot be prevented no
matter what playground surfacing material is used.   </P>

<a name="1"></a>
<H3>1. Determining Shock Absorbency of a Surfacing Material</H3>

<P>No data are available to predict precisely the threshold
tolerance of the human head to an impact injury.  However,
biomedical researchers have established two methods that may be
used to determine when such an injury may be life threatening. </P>

<P>One method holds that if the peak deceleration of the head during
impact does not exceed 200 times the acceleration due to gravity
(200 G's), a life threatening head injury is not likely to occur.
The second method holds that both the deceleration of the head
during impact and the time duration over which the head
decelerates to a halt are significant in assessing head impact
injury.  This latter method uses a mathematical formula to derive
a value known as Head Injury Criteria (HIC) [NOTE: Collantes,
Margaritsa, Evaluation of the Importance of Using Head Injury
Criterion (HIC) to Estimate the Likelihood of Head Impact Injury
as a Result of a Fall Onto Playground Surface Materials; U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, D.C. 20207,
October 1990.] Head impact injuries are not believed to be life
threatening if the HIC does not exceed a value of 1,000. </P>

<P>The most widely used test method for evaluating the shock
absorbing properties of a playground surfacing material is to
drop an instrumented metal headform onto a sample of the material
and record the acceleration/time pulse during the impact. Such a
method is described in an ASTM Standard Specification for Impact
Attenuation of Surface Systems Under and Around Playground
Equipment, ASTM F1292. [ASTM, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia,
PA 19103]  </P>

<H3>2. Critical Height</H3>
<P>  This is a term originating from Europe and
is used to describe the shock absorbing performance of a
surfacing material.  As it is used in this publication, the
Critical Height for a surfacing material is defined as THE
MAXIMUM HEIGHT FROM WHICH THE INSTRUMENTED METAL HEADFORM, UPON
IMPACT, YIELDS BOTH A PEAK DECELERATION OF NO MORE THAN 200 G'S
AND A HIC OF NO MORE THAN 1,000 WHEN TESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE PROCEDURE DESCRIBED IN ASTM F1292.  Critical Height,
therefore, can be considered as an approximation of the
maximum fall height from which a life-threatening head injury
would not be expected to occur.  </P>

<P>The surfacing material used under and around a particular piece
of playground equipment should have a Critical Height value of at
least the height of the highest accessible part of the equipment.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="3"></a>
<H3>3.  Highest Accessible Part of Equipment</H3>
<P>Recommendations for the "highest accessible part" for various
pieces of playground equipment are as follows.  </P>

<P><B>Swings</B> -- Since children may fall from a swing seat at its
maximum attainable angle (assumed to be 90 from the "at rest"
position), the highest accessible part of a swing structure is
the height of the pivot point where the swing's suspending
elements connect to the supporting structure.  </P>

<P><B>Elevated Platforms Including Slide Platforms</B> -- Since children
may climb onto or over guardrails, the highest accessible part of
a platform surrounded by guardrails is the height above the
playing surface of the top of the guardrail. Since protective
barriers are designed to minimize the likelihood of climbing, the
highest accessible part of a platform surrounded by protective
barriers is the height of the platform surface above
the ground.  </P>

<P>Climbers and Horizontal Ladders -- For structures that
are intended to be climbed upon, the highest accessible part is
the maximum height of the structure.  </P>

<P><B>Merry-Go-Rounds</B> -- The highest accessible part is the height
above the ground of any part at the perimeter on which a child
may sit or stand.  </P>

<P><B>Seesaws</B> -- The highest accessible part is the maximum height
attainable by any part of the seesaw.  </P>

<P><B>Spring Rockers</B> -- The highest accessible part is the maximum
height above the ground of the seat or designated play surface.  </P>

<H3>4.  Acceptability of Various Surfacing Materials</H3>
<P>Hard surfacing materials, such as asphalt or concrete, are
unsuitable for use under and around playground equipment of any
height unless they are required as a base for a shock absorbing
unitary material such as a rubber mat.  Earth surfaces such as
soils and hard packed dirt are also not recommended because their
shock absorbing properties can vary considerably depending on
climatic conditions such as moisture and temperature. Similarly,
grass and turf are not recommended because their effectiveness in
absorbing shock during a fall can be reduced considerably due to
wear and environmental conditions.  </P>

<P>Acceptable playground surfacing materials are available in two
basic types, UNITARY or LOOSE-FILL. </P>

<P><B>Unitary Materials</B> -- are generally rubber mats or a combination
of rubberlike materials held in place by a binder that may be
poured in place at the playground site and cures to form a
unitary shock absorbing surface.  Unitary materials are available
from a number of different manufacturers many of whom have a
range of materials with differing shock absorbing properties. 
Persons wishing to install a unitary material as a playground
surface should request test data from the manufacturer that
should identify the Critical Height of the desired material.  In
addition, site requirements should be obtained from the
manufacturer because, as stated above, some unitary materials
require installation over a hard surface while for others this is
not required.  </P>

<P><B>Loose-Fill Materials</B> -- can also have acceptable shock absorbing
properties when installed at a sufficient depth.  These materials
include, but are not confined to, sand, gravel, and shredded wood
products. Loose-fill materials should not be installed over hard
surfaces such as asphalt or concrete.  </P>

<P>Because loose-fill materials are generally sold for purposes
other than playground surfacing, many vendors are unlikely to be
able to provide information on their shock absorbing performance.
For that reason, CPSC staff has conducted tests to determine the
relative shock absorbing properties of some loose-fill materials
commonly used as surfaces under and around playground equipment. 
Appendix B contains a description of the tested materials.  The
tests were conducted in accordance with the procedure in the
voluntary standard for playground surfacing systems, ASTM F1292. 
Table 2, below, lists the critical height (expressed in feet) for
each of seven materials when tested in an uncompressed state at
depths of 6, 9, and 12 inches.  The table also reports the
critical height when a 9 inch depth of each material was tested
in a compressed state.  </P>

<P>The table should be read as follows: If, for example,
uncompressed wood mulch is used at a minimum depth of 6 inches,
the Critical Height is 7 feet.  If 9 inches of uncompressed wood
mulch is used, the Critical Height is 10 feet.  It should be
noted that, for some materials, the Critical Height decreases
when the material is compressed.   </P>

<P>   The Critical Heights shown in the above table may be used as a
guide in selecting the type and depth of loose-fill materials
that will provide the necessary safety for equipment of various
heights.  There may be other loose-fill materials such as bark
nuggets or shredded tires that have shock absorbing properties
equivalent to those in the above table.  However, no tests have
been conducted on these materials by CPSC staff.  </P>

<P>The depth of any loose-fill material could be reduced during use
resulting in different shock-absorbing properties.  For this
reason, a margin of safety should be considered in selecting a
type and depth of material for a specific use.   </P>

<H3>5.  Accessibility To the Disabled</H3>
<P>The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) prohibits
discrimination on the basis of disability in employment, public
services, transportation, public accommodations -- including many
services operated by private entities -- and telecommunications. 
Title III of the legislation includes within the definition of
public accommodation: "a park, zoo, amusement park, or other
place  of recreation"; a school, including nursery schools; a day
care center; and a gymnasium, health spa, or "other places of
exercise or recreation."  Specific Federal requirements for
accessibility to playgrounds by the disabled are expected to be
published. </P>

<P>The Department of Parks and Recreation in the State of California
has advised that after January 1, 1991, regulations requiring
that all types of play activity in new and redone play areas must
be accessible to the disabled.  Other states may similarly issue
accessibility requirements.  Playground designers, installers and
operators are reminded that they should determine what Federal
and State requirements for accessibility are in effect. These
requirements could necessitate changes to existing playgrounds as
well as when new playgrounds are planned or existing playgrounds
refurbished.   </P>

<B>Organic Loose Material:</B> wood chips, bark mulch, etc.   <BR><BR>

<P>     FALL ABSORBING CHARACTERISTICS -- Cushioning effect depends
on air trapped within and between individual particles, and
presupposes an adequate depth of material.  See Table for
performance data.  </P>

<P>     INSTALLATION/MAINTENANCE: Should not be installed over
existing hard surfaces (e.g., asphalt, concrete). Requires a
method of containment (e.g., retaining barrier, excavated pit).
Requires good drainage underneath material. Requires periodic
renewal or replacement and continuous maintenance (e.g.,
leveling, grading, sifting, raking) to maintain appropriate depth
and remove foreign matter.   </P>

<P>     ADVANTAGES:  Low initial cost. Ease of installation.
     Good drainage. Less abrasive than sand. Less attractive to
     cats and dogs (compared to sand). Attractive appearance.
     Readily available.  </P>

<P>     DISADVANTAGES:  The following conditions may reduce
     cushioning potential:  1.  Environmental conditions; rainy
     weather, high humidity, freezing temperatures.  2.  With
     normal use over time, combines with dirt and other foreign
     materials.  3.  Over time, decomposes, is pulverized, and
     compacts.  4.  Depth may be reduced by displacement due to
     children's activities or by material being blown by wind. 
     Can be blown or thrown into children's eyes. Subject to
     microbial growth when wet. Conceals animal excrement and
     trash (e.g., broken glass, nails, pencils, and other sharp
     objects that can cause cut and puncture wounds. Spreads
     easily outside of containment area. Can be flammable.
     Subject to theft by neighborhood residents for use as mulch.</P>


<B>Inorganic Loose Material:</B> sand and gravel <BR><BR>

<P>     FALL ABSORBING CHARACTERISTICS -- See Table for performance
data.   </P>

<P>     INSTALLATION/MAINTENANCE:  Should not be installed over
existing hard surfaces (e.g., asphalt, rock). Method
of containment needed (e.g., retaining barrier, excavated pit).
Good drainage required underneath material. Requires periodic
renewal or replacement and continuous maintenance (e.g.,
leveling, grading, sifting, raking) to maintain appropriate depth
and remove foreign matter. Compacted sand should periodically be
turned over, loosened, and cleaned. Gravel may require periodic
break up and removal of hard pan.   </P>

<P>     ADVANTAGES:  Low initial cost. Ease of installation. Does
     not pulverize. Not ideal for microbial growth. Nonflammable.
     Materials are readily available. Not susceptible to
     vandalism except by contamination. Gravel is less attractive
     to animals than sand.   
    </P> 
<P>     DISADVANTAGES:  The following conditions reduce
     cushioning potential:  1.  Environmental conditions: rainy
     weather, high humidity, freezing temperatures.  2.  With
     normal use, combines with dirt and other foreign materials. 
     3.  Depth may be reduced due to displacement by children's
     activities and sand may be blown by wind.  May be swallowed.
     Conceals animal excrement and trash (e.g., broken glass,
     nails, pencils, and other sharp objects that can cause cut
     and puncture wounds).   </P>

<P>SAND:  Spreads easily outside of containment area. Small
particles bind together and become less cushioning when wet; when
thoroughly wet, sand reacts as a rigid material. May be tracked
out of play area on shoes; abrasive to floor surfaces when
tracked indoors; abrasive to plastic materials. Adheres to
clothing. Susceptible to fouling by animals.   </P>

<P>GRAVEL:  Difficult to walk on. If displaced onto nearby hard
surface pathways, could present a fall hazard. Hard pan may
form under heavily traveled areas.   </P>


<B>Unitary Synthetic Materials:</B> rubber or rubber over foam mats or
tiles, poured in place urethane and rubber compositions   <BR><BR>

<P>     FALL ABSORBING CHARACTERISTICS -- Manufacturer should be
contacted for information on Critical Height of materials when
tested according to ASTM F1292.  </P>

<P>     INSTALLATION/MAINTENANCE:  Some unitary materials can be
laid directly on hard surfaces such as asphalt or concrete.
Others may require expert under-surface preparation and
installation by the manufacturer or a local contractor. Materials
generally require no additional means of containment. Once
installed, the materials require minimal maintenance.   </P>

<P>     ADVANTAGES:  Low maintenance. Easy to clean. Consistent
     shock absorbency. Material not displaced by children during
     play activities. Generally low life cycle costs. Good
     footing (depends on surface texture). Harbor few foreign
     objects. Generally no retaining edges needed. Is accessible
     to the handicapped.   
    </P> 
<P>     DISADVANTAGES:  Initial cost relatively high. Under
     surfacing may be critical for thinner materials. Often must
     be used on almost level uniform surfaces. May be flammable.
     Subject to vandalism (e.g., ignited, defaced, cut). Full
     rubber tiles may curl up and cause tripping. Some designs
     susceptible to frost damage. </P>

The outer ear includes the part outside the head and the earcanal.  The eardrum is a small circle of tissue about the size of afingertip at the end of the ear canal.  The middle ear is the space,usually filled with air, behind the eardrum.   When a child has middleear fluid, this is where it is found.  A small tube -- the eustachiantube -- connects the middle ear to the back of the nose.  Three tinybones (the malleus, incus, and stapes) connect the eardrum through themiddle ear to the inner ear.  The inner ear is further inside the headand is important for hearing and balance. </P> <P>In a healthy ear, sound waves travel through the ear canal and make theeardrum move back and forth.  This makes the three bones in the middleear move.  The movement of these bones sends sound waves across themiddle ear to the inner ear.  The inner ear sends the sound messages tothe brain.  But if the middle ear has fluid in it, then the eardrum andthe bones cannot move well.  This could cause your child to have troublehearing.  </P> <a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr> <a name="Purpose"></a><H3>Purpose of This Booklet</H3> <P>This booklet is about middle ear fluid in children ages 1 through 3 whohave no other health problems.  After reading this booklet you shouldknow more about:</P><UL TYPE=DISC>   	<LI> Causes of middle ear fluid.<BR><BR>   	<LI> Tests for middle ear fluid and hearing.<BR><BR>   	<LI> Treatments for middle ear fluid and hearing loss caused by middle earfluid.<BR><BR>   	<LI> How to work with your child's health care provider to find the best     	treatment for your child's middle ear fluid.<BR><BR></UL>  <P>Another name for middle ear fluid is otitis media with effusion.  Somepeople also call it "glue ear."  Otitis media means middle earinflammation, and effusion means fluid.  </P> <a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="What"></a><H3>What Is Middle Ear Fluid?</H3> <P>If your child has middle ear fluid, it means that a watery or mucous-like fluid has collected behind the eardrum.   Many children get middleear fluid during their early years.  But middle ear fluid is not thesame as an ear infection.  </P> <UL TYPE=DISC>   	<LI>An Ear Infection usually happens in only one ear at a time.  With a     	middle ear infection your child may have fever and sharp ear pain.     	When your health care provider looks into your child's ear, they     	might see a bulging red eardrum and some fluid in the middleear.<BR><BR>   	<LI>Middle Ear Fluid is usually found in both ears at once.  Most     	children do not have fever or pain with middle ear fluid.  A     	special test is needed to look for this fluid (see below).<BR><BR></UL> <a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr>  <a name="Causes"></a><H3>What Causes Middle Ear Fluid?</H3> <P>Here are some things that may cause middle ear fluid to happen in yourchild:</P><UL TYPE=DISC>   	<LI> Past ear infection.  It is common for children to have middle ear     	infections.  And some children with middle ear infection later have     	middle ear fluid.<BR><BR>   	<LI> Blockage of the eustachian tube (see Figure 1 ).<BR><BR>   	<LI> Cold or flu.<BR><BR></UL>  <P>There is no one cause for middle ear fluid.  Often, your child's healthcare provider will not know what caused the middle ear fluid.  </P> <P>You may want to use the chart at the end of this booklet to keep trackof when your child has ear problems and medical treatments.  </P> <a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr> <a name="Why"></a><H3>Why Should I Be Worried About Middle Ear Fluid?</H3> <P>Most health care providers and parents worry that a child who has middleear fluid in one or both ears can have trouble hearing.  Experts do notknow how much middle ear fluid affects hearing.  Experts are not sure ifhearing loss from middle ear fluid can cause delays in learning to talk,and sometimes later on, problems with school work.  They do not know forsure what the long-term effects of middle ear fluid are.  </P> <a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr> <a name="How"></a><H3>How Can Middle Ear Fluid Be Prevented?</H3> <P>Recent studies show that children who live with smokers and who spendtime in group child care have more ear infections.  </P> <P>Because some children who have middle ear infections later get middleear fluid, you might help prevent middle ear fluid by:</P><UL TYPE=DISC>   	<LI> Keeping your child away from cigarette smoke.<BR><BR>   	<LI> Trying to keep your child away from playmates who are sick.<BR><BR></UL>  <a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr></td></tr></table> <table border=0 valign="top" halign="left" cellpadding="5"><tr><td valign=top halign=left width=100><img src="/images/spacer.gif" haligh=left>                   </td><td valign=top> <a name="Do"></a><H3>How Do I Know If My Child Is Affected by Middle Ear Fluid?</H3> <P>Sometimes a child with middle ear fluid does not hear well.  The mostcommon complaint of parents whose child has middle ear fluid is that thechild turns the sound up too loud or sits too close to the televisionset.  Or sometimes the child does not seem to be paying attention.  </P> <P>Speak to your child's health care provider if you are concerned aboutyour child's hearing.  Often, middle ear fluid is found at a regularcheck-up.  </P> <P>Your child's health care provider may use the first two tests below tocheck for middle ear fluid.</P>  <UL type=disc>   <LI> A Pneumatic Otoscope may be used to check for middle ear fluid (see     Figure 2 ).  With this tool, the health care provider looks at the     eardrum.  The fluid in the middle ear may be seen behind the     eardrum.  Even when the fluid cannot be seen, the health care     provider can test for fluid with this tool by blowing a puff of air     onto the eardrum to see how well the eardrum moves.  The child must     be still for this test to work.  The child will feel the otoscope     in the ear, but the test does not hurt.  This test does NOT measure     the child's hearing level.   Many health care providers feel that     the pneumatic otoscope is the best test for middle ear fluid.<BR><BR>     <LI> Tympanometry is another test for middle ear fluid.  Tympanometry     helps the health care provider find out how well the eardrum moves.     For tympanometry, a soft plug that is about the size of a person's     little fingertip is placed snugly into the ear canal.  The probe is     connected to a machine called a tympanometer.  The child hears a     low noise for a short time while the machine records how the     eardrum reacts.  An eardrum with fluid behind it does not move as     well as a normal eardrum.<BR><BR>     <LI> Like the first test, the child must sit still for this test and     will feel the probe in the ear.  The test does not hurt.      Tympanometry does NOT measure hearing level.<BR><BR>     <LI> Hearing Testing may be done to see how well your child hears.     Hearing testing does not test for middle ear fluid. In this case,     it measures if the fluid is affecting your child's hearing level.     The type of hearing test used depends on your child's age and     listening ability.<BR><BR> </UL> <a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr> <a name="Can"></a><H3>How Can Middle Ear Fluid Be Treated?</H3> <P>Middle ear fluid can be treated in many ways.  It is important to knowthat a treatment that works for one child may not work for another.  Ifone treatment does not work, another treatment can be tried.  Pleasediscuss each of the treatments listed here with your child's health careprovider.  Be sure to ask about the possible advantages anddisadvantages of each treatment as well.  Then, decide with your child'shealth care provider on the treatment for middle ear fluid.  </P><UL type=disc>  <LI> Observation -- Middle ear fluid often goes away without treatment.     Some studies show that for most children middle ear fluid clears     after 3 to 6 months without treatment.<BR><BR>    <LI> Antibiotic Drug Treatment -- Studies show that middle ear fluid     cleared slightly faster in some children given antibiotic drugs     than those not given antibiotics.  However, antibiotics have some     unwanted effects, such as diarrhea, rash, and others (see table in     next section).  Also, they can be expensive and some children have     trouble taking them.  For these reasons, you and your child's     health care provider may want to try observation first.<BR><BR></UL>  <P>Before making a decision, ask your child's health care provider aboutthe costs and possible unwanted effects.  </P><UL type=disc>    <LI> Surgery to put "Tubes" in the Ears -- In this minor operation, a     small cut is made in the child's eardrum and fluid in the middle     ear is gently sucked out.  Then a small metal or plastic tube is     put into the slit in the eardrum.  A general anesthetic is used to     put the child to sleep for this operation.  When the fluid is     removed from the middle ear, the child's hearing returns to its     normal level.<BR><BR></UL>  <P>Ask your child's health care provider about the costs and possible harmsof this surgery.  </P> <P>The tubes are left in place until they fall out, or until your child'shealth care provider feels that they are no longer needed.

<P>
This bibliography is intended to help parents and professionals identify books that are written about or include characters who have a disability. The list is grouped according the following disabilities: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), blindness, cerebral palsy, deafness, learning disabilities, serious or life-threatening conditions, physical disabilities, and other disabilities. At times, for clarity, we have indicated in parentheses additional information about what disability or main theme is involved in the story.
</P>

<P>
This bibliography is by no means exhaustive. You may identify additional children's literature relating to disability by:
</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> using the books listed in this bibliography under "Other Resources;"<BR><BR>

	<LI> checking to see what books about disability the library in your area has available; and<BR><BR>

	<LI> checking to see what disability books are available in local bookstores.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>
These books can offer an excellent vehicle for communicating with children about disabilities, for providing children and young adults with stories about persons like themselves, and for featuring the personalities, friendships, challenges, accomplishments, and daily lives of people with disabilities.
</P>
<HR>
<a name="Identifying"></a>
<H3>Identifying the Age or Grade Level of a Book</H3>

<P>
To help you determine the age group or grade level for which each of these books is appropriate, we have either indicated the age/grade level in parentheses or we have used the following codes:
</P>

<P>
JP= Juvenile Picture Book
</P>

<blockquote>
<P>
Suitable for preschoolers to third graders, these books are generally 32 pages in length, with an illustration on each page and minimal text; typically designed for parents to read to their children or for older children to read on their own
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
JE = Juvenile Easy Reader
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
Suitable for children who are beginning to read on their own, such as those in first or second grade; ranging from 30 to 80 pages long, these books depend upon repetition of words, phrases, and sentence patterns, and have a controlled or limited vocabulary; illustrations are included to break up the text, which is generally in an easy-to-read large typeface
</P>
</blockquote>

<P>
JF = Juvenile Fiction
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
Known as children's fiction or chapter books, these are suitable for children in Grades 2-6; ranging in length from 60 to 200 pages, the books are generally divided into chapters, contain fewer illustrations, and have more complicated plots or concepts than either JP or JE books
</P>
</blockquote>

<P>
YA = Young Adult
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
Intended for young adults ranging from Grade 5 through Grade 12, these books present more complicated plots and deal with topics and concerns of general interest to the young adult population; not all libraries have a young adult section, so it may be necessary to look for these books in the adult collection
</P>

<P>
PHILADELPHIA, July 9 /PRNewswire/ -- During this summer's Olympic games, no matter who the big winners are, it's almost certain that one of the continuing news stories will revolve around use of banned substances by athletes.
</P>

<P>
But what may be a much more important story has gone under-reported: the deliberate use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes at all levels of competition in the United State. So suggest the authors of a new book, "Warning: Drugs in Sports -- A Handbook for Every Athlete and Parent" (published by Medical Surveillance, Inc.).
</P>

<P>
"Performance-enhancing drugs have penetrated college, high school and junior high/middle school athletics," explained co-author Dr. Andrew Ferko, associate professor of Pharmacology, Allegheny University of the Health Sciences, Philadelphia.
</P>

<P>
Though many sports programs have instituted drug screenings, they are often too narrow to catch most drugs or can't keep up with innovations in performance-enhancing drugs. For example, the drug Erythropoietin, used to increase the blood's ability to carry oxygen, will not be screened at the Olympics.
</P>

<P>
"What can be perceived as a way to excel in sports or every day life can easily ruin that life," Dr. Ferko explained. "When the ultimate goal of the drug-taking athlete is to win at any cost, those costs may be greater than the athlete realizes. He or she may literally be dying to win."
</P>

<P>
Dr. Ferko and his colleagues did not write the book only for Olympic and professional athletes. The authors sought to provide all levels of athletes, coaches and parents with substantial knowledge about how specific drugs work and the problems they can create. The misused drugs they cite are as common as coffee and as deadly as cocaine, because aside from use of illegal or clearly banned substances, athletes often misuse legal drugs -- such as caffeine and aspirin -- that can provide short term competitive benefits.
</P>

<P>
"These drugs are usually taken prior to vigorous workouts and training to enhance stamina or reduce the pain and soreness that is associated with strenuous exercise," explained co-author Dr. Edward Barbieri, associate professor of Pharmacology, Allegheny. And, innocuous as they may seem, the routine use of aspirin, ibuprofen or other NSAIDs can create adverse effects in the gastrointestinal tract such as gastric irritation, abdominal pain, ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding, he noted.
</P>

<P>
Another important issue the authors illustrate is how athletes may also inadvertently use a drug that is banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Those drugs are usually central nervous system stimulants, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (found in Robitussin-PE) and phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride (found in Triaminic Cold Tablets and weight control suppressants).
</P>

<P>
"Athletes often use these over-the-counter drugs for health reasons, unaware of the potential threat to their competitive status," said co-author Dr. John DiGregorio, professor of Pharmacology and Medicine, Allegheny.
</P>

<P>
Caffeine used by competitive athletes is considered illegal if the amount measured in the urine is greater then 12 micrograms/ML (about six to eight cups of coffee). "It is banned," Dr. DiGregorio noted, "because it can increase muscle contraction, improve performance, and increase the time to fatigue or exhaustion during prolonged moderate or intense exercise."
</P>

<P>
The authors believe it is important for athletes, coaches and parents to understand the full extent of the dangers and effects of drugs in sports. "Warning: Drugs in Sports" is an excellent guide for professionals and amateurs alike -- providing specific and practical guidance and information.

<P>
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Studies presented by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the XI International AIDS Conference reinforce earlier findings that perinatal HIV transmission can be reduced by treating mother and child with zidovudine (ZDV). "Before 1994, when our ZDV treatment guidelines were published, 21% of the children in our study were infected. Since the guidelines, it's dropped to 10%," says R.J. Simonds, M.D., one of the CDC researchers.
</P>

<P>
"The best way to prevent perinatal HIV transmission is to prevent HIV infection in women," says Helene Gayle, M.D., M.P.H., Director of CDC's National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention. "That being said, it is clear that we can greatly reduce the risk of HIV transmission from an infected mother to her child. The key is providing pregnant women easy access to prenatal care early in pregnancy and routinely giving them information about the benefits of knowing their HIV serostatus and then offering and encouraging an HIV test. We must also ensure that women have access to ZDV and other needed medical care, for themselves and their infants, and that health care providers are prepared to care for HIV positive pregnant women."
</P>

<P>
Gayle notes that studier presented by Simonds and another CDC researcher Richard Steketee, M.D., support ZDV's efficacy, but adds that other factors also play a role in reducing transmission. "Preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission may  require changes in obstetric practices," she says. "Our studies show an increased risk of infection when the mother's membranes have ruptured more than 4 hours before delivery. With shorter duration of ruptured membranes, we saw a reduction in the rate of transmission. Other characteristics that effect perinatal transmission are mothers' CD+4. counts of less than 500 and stage of the mother's illness. "The bottom line is that the sicker mom is, the more likely the baby will be infected. But even when mothers are very sick, ZDV still helps prevent transmission," Gayle says.
</P>

<P>
Related studies presented by CDC researchers addressed the role Of these and other factors in reducing perinatal transmission. Research by Brenda Seals, Ph.D. demonstrated that the majority of women infected with HIV are interested in ZDV treatment during pregnancy and for their children after birth. But women's interest in and commitment to adhering to the ZDV treatment regimen seems particularly sensitive to physicians' attitudes, underscoring the importance Of educating health care providers about the benefits Of ZDV during pregnancy. A study presented by Sherry Orloff, M.P.H. showed that ZDV use has increased since the publication Of the ZDV treatment guidelines, but is still variable by hospital. Researchers examined rates of ZDV use in hospitals in the New York City area, Atlanta and Baltimore and found that usage ranged from 33% to 90% Of enrolled mothers, depending on the hospital and the populations it served. The lowest rates of ZDV use were among women who used cocaine during pregnancy and women with no HIV related symptoms or illnesses.
</P>

<P>
In another study, Anna Shakarishvill, M.D. and fellow researchers studied the association of HIV transmission and no or late prenatal care with demographic, social, and other characteristics of infected women in Texas. "The data show that some women receive very late or no prenatal care and that lack of timely care is associated with having less than 12 years of education and being unmarried," Shakarishvili says. "To reduce perinatal HIV transmission and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, comprehensive interventions to increase early prenatal care are urgently needed." Her conclusion was underscored by research presented by Jeanne Bertolli, Ph.D. showing that breastfeeding, a known route of perinatal transmission, was much more common among women whose HIV infection was not known before delivery. In contrast, infected women who received comprehensive prenatal care, including routine counseling and voluntary HIV testing, were less likely to breastfeed their babies.
</P>

<P>
Finally, an economic analysis by Paul Farnham, Ph.D. and others at CDC shows that prenatal care including HIV counseling and testing and ZDV for infected mothers and their children is cost effective. "Without intervention, a 25% mother-to-infant transmission rate would result in approximately 1,750 HIV-infected infants annually in the U.S., and lifetime medical costs of $282 million," Farnham says. "We estimated the cost of intervention at $67.6 million, preventing 656 infant HIV infections with a savings of $105.6 million in medical care costs, and a net cost-savings of $38.1 million. These results strongly support routine counseling, voluntary testing and ZDV use."
</P>

<P>
It is possible that these savings could be increased, if research shows a shorter course of ZDV during pregnancy is just as effective. Several clinical trials of short-course ZDV during pregnancy are underway in sub-Saharan Africa. "In developing countries, the extensive ZDV course recommended in the U.S. is not feasible Gayle notes. If we can demonstrate that a short course works, we have a promising advance for addressing the terrible toll perinatal transmission taxes internationally." A model presented by CDC researcher Gordon Mansergh, M.A. indicates that a national perinatal HIV prevention program in sub-Saharan African countries would reduce transmission and could provide significant societal savings, after a substantial initial investment in public health infrastructure and drugs.
</P>

<P>
"We have made significant gains in the U.S. and worldwide in translating science into life-saving prevention." Gayle says. "As is always true with HIV prevention, the solutions aren't simple or easy to implement. But the strides we are making in perinatal prevention clearly document the benefits.'

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Researchers from the Canters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) present new findings at the XI International AIDS Conference that document the continued need for HIV prevention messages that are targeted to reflect the diverse experiences of young people, including messages to delay sexual intercourse. Researchers found that many sexually active young women may be at increased risk for HIV infection through sex with older men.
</P>

<P>
"We cannot accept the repeated toll of HIV infection on our youth," stresses Helene Gayle, M.D., M.P.H., Director of CDC's National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention. "There is increasing evidence that a wide range of prevention messages are needed to reduce this toll." A new study conducted by CDC Behavioral Scientist Kim Miller, Ph.D. underscores the importance of understanding the many factors that make young people vulnerable to HIV infection and the need for prevention messages that address the wide-range of adolescent sexual experience, including abstinence and delay of sexual activity. For young woman who are sexually active, Miller found that the age of their first sex partner may influence their risk of transmission. Young women whose first sex partner was an older man were less likely to use condoms and possibly at higher risk for HIV infection than young women whose first partner was the same age.
</P>

<P>
"Prevention messages must address the diversity of experience among young people. Risk behaviors varied widely among the adolescents in this study, and so must prevention messages," says Miller. "These findings suggest that in addition to other risk factors, sexually active young women need to understand that they may be at greater risk for HIV if they are having sex with older men..
</P>

<H3>Risk May Increase with Age of Partner</H3>

<P>
Miller's study analyzed risk behaviors among a group of 14- to 17 year-old students from New York, Puerto Rico, and Alabama. One component of the study compared the risk behaviors of young women whose first sex partner was at least three years older with risk behaviors of young women whose first sex partner was the same age. Miller found that 35X of the female students reported having their first voluntary sexual experience with older partners (from 3 to 21 years older). These women were more likely to be younger and less likely to use condoms at first intercourse than those whose first partner was the same age.
</P>

<P>
Moreover, researchers suspect that, due to more varied sexual and drug use experiences, older male partners may also be more likely to be HIV infected than teens sad, therefore, present a greater risk of transmission. The age difference may also make it more difficult for young women to negotiate condom use with their partner.
</P>


<H3>Surveillance Data Indicate Ongoing Risk</H3>

<P>
A related CDC study on trends in AIDS incidence (the number of cases diagnosed per year) supports Millers' findings, adding validation to the hypothesis that older men may be playing a role in the spread of HIV to young women. The study, presented by Pascale Wortley, M.D. examined AIDS incidence among women and found that between l990 and 1994. AIDS incidence increased most among women infected heterosexually who were born between 1970 and 1974. An analysis of current AIDS case reports suggest that most women infected heterosexually become infected through sex with an injection drug user. The study examined the relationship between AIDS incidence in men infected through injection drug use and women infected heterosexually and found that among people born between 1970 and 1974, women infected heterosexually outnumbered men infected through injection drug use by more than two to one. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that young women are being infected by sex partners older than themselves.
</P>

<P>
New national data on risk behaviors among 14- to 18-year-olds also demonstrate the potential for HIV risk among young people while, at the same time, showing encouraging signs of behavior change. The study by CDC's Janet Collins, Ph.D. reported trends in sexual behaviors among U.S. high school students by examining data from the national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (l990 to 1995). No significant change was detected in the number of high school students ever having had sexual intercourse (52%) nor the number reporting sex with four or more partners (18%). However, Collins Pound significant evidence of increased condom use among sexually active young people -- particularly female and African American students.
</P>

<P>
"The leveling of sexual risk behavior rates and the reported increase in condom use represent important strides in preventing HIV infection among youth," says Collins. "We must continue to promote the delayed initiation of sexual activity and strengthen our efforts in this area as we, at the same time, continue to encourage condom use among those young people who are sexually active.'
</P>

<H3>New Approaches to Prevention</H3>

<P>
CDC is looking closely at new tools and approaches to improve prevention messages and programs for youth. In her research, Miller also sought to better define the behavioral intentions of young people using a new system that more clearly defines the range of adolescent sexual experiences so that effective prevention messages and programs can be designed. Miller developed a new typology that classifies a wider range of behavior than the traditional categories of "sexually active" and "sexually inactive." Miller used the typology to classify the adolescents in her study using several new categories. Thirty-seven percent of the young people, ages 14 to 17, fell into the "delayers" category, because they had no intention of initiating sexual intercourse. Twenty-two percent were "anticipators" (those who intended to initiate intercourse in the next year), 5% were "one-timers" (those who had intercourse only one time, but not again), 8% were "steadies" (those with a history of intercourse with one partner), and 28% were "multiples" (those who had a history of intercourse with multiple partners ) .
</P>

<P>
"Clearly, young people have varying levels of sexual experience. This typology recognizes the diversity of behaviors and intentions among young people and is an important first step in reaching them with messages that are relevant to them," says Miller. "For example, messages promoting delay of sexual activity are important for both 'anticipators' -- those on the verge of sexual activity -- and for 'one timers' -- those who have only had sex once. But the approaches would have to be very different and based on their experience," says Miller.
</P>

<P>
CDC hopes that these and other findings will lead to improved HIV prevention programs for young people. "CDC has for many years worked to provide state and local health and education agencies, and community based organizations assistance in designing effective HIV prevention messages and programs for young people," says Gayle. "We will continue this collaboration to improve HIV prevention. Our future depends on it."

<P>According to reports received by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission, from 1982 to 1986 several deaths and thousands of
injuries occurred to children when furniture tipped over. These
injuries and deaths occurred when children fell against, climbed
onto, or sat on furniture. They also occurred when children tried
to move furniture or open or close drawers or doors. Young
children tried to pull themselves up or climb on chests of
drawers, TV carts, stands, or tables, or bookcase shelves.
Furniture can tip over on children.</P>

<P>Chests of drawers tip-overs were associated with an estimated
2,000 hospital emergency room treated injuries per year from 1982
through 1986. Six children under 5 years of age died when these
chests tipped over on them.</P>

<P>TV tip-overs were associated with an estimated 2300 hospital
emergency room-treated injuries per year from 1982 through 1986.
Four children under 5 years of aged died when TVs fell on them.
CPSC estimates that 400 of the injuries occurred when the TV was
located on a cart, stand, or table.</P>

<P>Bookcase tip-overs were associated with approximately 580
hospital emergency room-treated injuries annually from 1982
through 1986. One child under 5 years of age died when a bookcase
tipped
over.</P>

<P><B>Warning</B></P>

<P>Young children can be killed when furniture tips over.</P>

<P>Place TVs on lower furniture, as far back as possible. Use
angle-braces or anchors to secure furniture to wall.

<P>According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, an
estimated 260 children under five years of age drown each year in
residential swimming pools and spas. The Commission estimates
that another 3,000 children under age five are treated in
hospital emergency rooms following submersion accidents each
year. Some of these submersion accidents result in permanent
brain damage</P>

<P>Nationally, drowning is the fourth leading cause of death to
children under five. In some states such as California, Florida
and Arizona, drowning is the leading cause of accidental death to
children under five.</P>

<P>CPSC offers the following tips for pool owners:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> Never leave a child unsupervised near a pool.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Instruct babysitters about potential hazards to young children
	  in and around swimming pools and the need for constant
	  supervision.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Completely fence the pool. Install self-closing and
	  self-latching gates. Position latches out of reach of young
	  children. Keep all doors and windows leading to the pool area
	  secure to prevent small children from getting to the pool.
	  Effective barriers and locks are necessary preventive measures,
	  but there is no substitute for supervision.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Do not consider young children "drown proof" because they have
  had swimming lessons; young children should always be watched
  carefully while swimming.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Do not use flotation devices as a substitute for supervision.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Never use a pool with its pool cover partially in place, since
	  children may become entrapped under it. Remove the cover
	  completely.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Place tables and chairs well away from the pool fence to
	  prevent children from climbing into the pool area.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Keep toys away from the pool area because a young child playing
	  with the toys could accidentally fall in the water.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Remove steps to above ground pools when not in use.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Have a telephone at poolside to avoid having to leave children
	unattended in or near the pool to answer a telephone elsewhere. 
	Keep emergency numbers at the poolside telephone.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Learn CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).<BR><BR>

	<LI> Keep rescue equipment by the pool.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>PARENTS AND GUARDIANS: ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT A DROWNING. WATCH
YOUR CHILD CLOSELY AT ALL TIMES. MAKE SURE DOORS LEADING TO THE
POOL AREA ARE CLOSED AND LOCKED. YOUNG CHILDREN CAN QUICKLY SLIP
AWAY AND INTO THE POOL.</P>

<P>THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION CAUTIONS DIVERS ABOUT
IMPROPER DIVING PRACTICES:</P>

<P>Diving injuries can result in quadriplegia, paralysis below the
neck, to divers who hit the bottom or side of a swimming pool,
according to CPSC. Divers should observe the following
precautions:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> Never dive into above-ground pools. They are too shallow.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Don't dive from the side of an in-ground pool. Enter the water
	  feet first.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Dive only from the end of the diving board and not from the
	  sides.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Dive with your hands in front of you and always steer up
	  immediately upon entering the water to avoid hitting the bottom
	  or sides of the pool.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Don't dive if you have been using alcohol or drugs because your
	  reaction time may be too slow.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>Improper use of pool slides presents the same danger as improper
diving techniques. Never slide down head first; slide down feet
first only.</P>

<P>In 1980, the third edition of the <I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</I> (DSM-III) [American Psychiatric Association (APA), 1980] introduced a major change in the conceptualization of the childhood disorder that had previously been called "hyperkinesis" or "hyperactivity". Because experts had begun to speculate that attention deficits, rather than high activity level, might play a greater role in the problems of these children, the term "attention deficit disorder" (ADD) replaced the earlier diagnostic terminology. Along with this shift in diagnostic emphasis came the recognition that attention deficits could exist even in the absence of high activity level, and thus two ADD subgroups were defined: ADD with hyperactivity (ADDM) and ADD without hyperactivity (ADD/WO). While the ADD/H category was fairly consistent with previous definitions, the latter subtype represented essentially a new category, for which there was no previous counterpart. Thus, almost everything we know about ADD/WO is based on research conducted since 1980.</P>

<P>From the start, the inclusion of ADD/WO as a valid diagnostic category has been the subject of considerable debate. Because of controversy surrounding how useful or "real" the subtype was, the 1987 revision of the DSM-III (DSMIII-R; APA 1987) excluded ADD/WO all together. Instead, the idea of a single type of ADD was reestablished and the term "Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder" (ADHD) was introduced. Although the DSM-IIIR did include an "Undifferentiated ADD (UADD)" category, this was essentially a residual grouping for which there were no formal diagnostic criteria. In retaining this diagnosis, DSM-III-R acknowledged the fact that researchers and clinicians might wish to continue to identify children diagnosed as ADD/WO so that more research could be obtained to evaluate the utility of its diagnosis.</P>

<P>However, such a classification scheme led to problems in the field as it was inconsistent with previous research supporting a behavioral distinction between the ADD subtypes. In addition, it was problematic clinically, in that there was no particular symptom constellation required for a diagnosis of ADHD, thus allowing children who were previously diagnosed as having ADD/WO to be inappropriately included in the ADHD category<SUP>1</SUP>. In response to such difficulties, the most recent edition of the DSM (DSM-IV; APA 1994) returned to DSM-III-type terminology. Current criteria delineates two separate symptom lists, inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, and allows children to be classified into one of three categories based on the presence or absence of symptoms in each of these areas: <B>ADHD, Combined Type (ADHD,C)</B>, which requires children to display at least six out of nine inattentive and six out of nine hyperactive-impulsive symptoms; <B>ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type (ADHD,IA)</B>, which requires at least six out of nine inattentive symptoms and less than six hyperactive-impulsive symptoms; and <B>ADHD, Hyperactive-Impulsive Type (ADHD,HI)</B>, which requires the presence of six out of nine hyperactive-impulsive symptoms and less than six inattentive symptoms. The ADHD,IA category is presumed to identify children diagnosed with DSM-III as ADD/WO, ADHD,C is thought to identify children given DSM-III ADDM or DSM-III-R ADHD diagnoses, and ADHD,HI is essentially a new category, presumed to identify extremely active children who do not display gross inattention. Although some of the research discussed below was conducted with children diagnosed as ADDM, ADD/WO, and ADHD, in this paper we will use the terms ADHD,C and ADHD,IA to refer to all attention-disordered children with and without hyperactivity, respectively.</P>

<P>If the above discussion confuses you, you are not alone. There has been a great deal of debate and disagreement among professionals about the nature of the ADHD,IA subtype. However, despite the changes in nomenclature, a good deal of research progress has been made. The most common research strategy has been to compare children with ADHD,IA to children with ADHD,C on important cognitive and behavioral dimensions. In these studies, questions regarding the similarities and differences between the subtypes have been addressed. In particular, research has focused on how we might expect children with ADHD,IA to develop, what problems they might face, and what treatments will be the most effective.</P>
<HR>

<a name="Activity"></a>
<H3>Activity Level</H3>

<P>One area in which fairly consistent findings have emerged involves the "behavioral activity style" demonstrated by ADHD,IA children. While children with ADHD,C are often described as boisterous, impulsive, excitable, and overactive, children with ADHD,IA are much less likely to receive such labels. In fact, studies have found that children with ADHD,IA are often described as "hyperactive", i.e., they are likely to show "underactivity" and be described as sluggish, lethargic, and daydreamy<SUP>2</SUP>. This unexpected finding has generated some interesting speculation about the ADHD,IA subgroup and further distinguished them from their ADHD,C peers. While children with ADHD,IA typically do not differ in activity level from nondisordered children, they are most notably not impulsive, a key characteristic of children with ADHD,C. The so called impulsivity of children with ADHD,IA is typically more related to disorganization than the physical impulsivity of children with ADHD,C. For example, raters are more likely to endorse items such as an inability to complete tasks and poor organizational skills when rating children with ADHD,IA, and items such as acts without thinking, shifts from one activity to another, and frequently interrupts others when rating children with ADHD,C<SUP>3</SUP>. This distinction was clarified in DSM-IV when a factor analysis<SUP>4</SUP> revealed that many of the DSM-III "impulsivity" items clustered with "hyperactivity", and others (e.g., "difficulty organizing tasks") clustered with inattention. This led to the current use of a single-symptom list for hyperactivity-impulsivity versus two separate listings (impulsivity and hyperactivity) used in DSM-III.</P>

<a name="Accompanying"></a>
<H3>Accompanying Disorders</H3>

<P>Research has shown that accompanying behavior disorders are likely to be found in both ADHD,C and ADHD,IA children. Thus, children with ADHD,IA are less likely to display "externalizing" problems, such as aggression and conduct disorders<SUP>5</SUP>. Some research also finds that among clinic-referred children, ADHD,IA children are more likely than ADHD,C children to display "internalizing" problems, such as depression and anxiety<SUP>6</SUP>. This theory is supported by research conducted by Barkley and his colleagues (1990) who, using a clinic-referred sample, found that the relatives of children with ADHD,C were more likely to suffer problems with substance abuse, aggression, and ADHD,C, than the relatives of children with ADHD,IA and nondisordered controls. In contrast, the relatives of children with ADHD,IA were more likely to have anxiety disorders than the relatives of children in the other groups. Still, findings on co-occurring internalizing problems between the ADHD subtypes are inconsistent. For example, a recent large-scale school-based study<SUP>7</SUP> found that teachers rated ADD,C children as showing more anxiety/depression than ADHD,IA children. This finding led the authors to speculate that it may be only among ADHD children who are referred to clinics that this pattern of greater internalizing problems among ADHD,IA children is displayed<SUP>8</SUP>. Thus, it may be that children with ADHD,IA who also display high levels of anxiety and/or depression are more likely to be referred to clinics than children with ADHD,IA alone. However, when identified in a general population, ADHD,IA children may not necessarily show greater levels of anxiety/depression than children with ADHD,C.</P>

<a name="Peer"></a>
<H3>Peer Relationships</H3>

<P>Since the problematic peer relationships of children with ADHD,C has been consistently found, it has been of interest to researchers to examine what, if any, peer relationship problems might characterize children with ADHD,IA. Of the studies that have examined this issue, the overall conclusion appears to be that both ADHD subtypes are less popular with their peers; however, the nature of their unpopularity seems slightly different<SUP>9</SUP>. For example, there is some evidence that the peer relationship problems of children with ADHD,C are more severe than those of children with ADHD,IA<SUP>10</SUP>. When rated by their peers, some studies find that children with ADHD,C are more "actively disliked" than children with ADHD,IA and nondisordered controls, whereas children with ADHD,IA are more "socially withdrawn". Based on these findings, some researchers have suggested that the nature of the ADHD subtypes' social deficits may, in fact, be qualitatively different. Using Gresham's (1988) model of social skills, Wheeler and Carlson (1994) proposed that children with ADHD,C may suffer from social performance deficits (i.e., they know what to do but do not use this knowledge appropriately), whereas children with ADHD,IA may suffer from deficits in both social performance and knowledge (i.e., they don't know what to do in social situations, thus they cannot use this knowledge appropriately). The authors further speculate that these deficits may be mediated by so-called interfering responses, which correspond to symptoms typically associated with the disorder. Thus, impulsivity and hyperactivity may prevent a child with ADHD,C from waiting his turn in line, even though he knows he is supposed to do so, and "sluggishness" and anxiety may prevent a child with ADHD,IA from participating in enough social interactions to learn the rules of the game. While this hypothesis has not been empirically tested, it clearly has important treatment applications. For example, if children with ADHD,C are found to possess adequate social knowledge, attention should be directed at decreasing what prevents them from interacting appropriately, rather than focusing exclusively on training in social skills. In contrast, if children with ADHD,IA are found not to know what to do in social situations, social skills training will be the most useful.</P>

<a name="School"></a>
<H3>School Performance</H3>

<P>We have evidence that children with ADHD,IA, like those with ADHD,C, often experience school learning problems. Indeed, some research has indicated that children with ADHD,IA may show elevated rates of school failure and are rated by teachers as having greater problems in learning, relative to nondisordered controls. One relatively recent finding is the strong relationship between inattention and academic problems. Studies examining the behavioral correlates of the ADHD subtypes have consistently shown greater academic difficulties in children diagnosed with ADHD,C and ADHD,IA than children with excess motor activity/impulsivity (ADHD,HI) alone<SUP>11</SUP>. With respect to intellectual functioning, there is little evidence for significant IQ differences between the ADHD groups, however, there is some research in support of a higher rate of learning disabilities in children with ADHD,IA<SUP>12</SUP>. In addition, children with ADHD,IA are typically more similar behaviorally to children with learning disabilities than are children with ADHD,C<SUP>13</SUP>. However, the specific nature of the relationship between learning disabilities and ADHD has not been clearly established. More research needs to be conducted before any firm conclusions can be drawn.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Etiology"></a>
<H3>Etiology</H3>

<P>The precise etiology, or cause, of ADHD is unknown. Numerous theories have been proposed, including those relating to abnormal brain development (e.g., an "immature brain"), neurochemical abnormalities, exposure to environmental toxins, and deficient childrearing practices. Although research has been conducted in all of these areas, no firm conclusions cam yet be drawn. Also, most studies have been done with children with ADHD,C, resulting in even less knowledge about the etiology of ADHD,IA. Some researchers have speculated ADHD,IA and ADHD,C are entirely different disorders, in which case they may stem from different causes. The most promising theories to date include exposure to various agents that can lead to brain injury (e.g., trauma, disease, fetal exposure to environmental toxins), diminished brain activity, and heredity<SUP>14</SUP>.</P>

<P>Research on children with ADHD,C has found that they seem to have underactive orbital-frontal regions, the part of the brain which is thought to be responsible for sustaining attention, inhibiting behavior, self-control, and planning<SUP>15</SUP>. This finding has been documented in several studies in which children with ADHD were shown to have diminished electrical activity and blood flow in this region, relative to nondisordered controls.</P>

<P>Again, less research exploring the possible cause of ADHD,IA has been conducted. Given the "sluggish" cognitive tempo and frequent achievement problems typically occurring in this subtype, some researchers have speculated that children with ADHD,IA may suffer from posterior, rather than frontal, right hemispheric dysfunction<SUP>16</SUP>. However, studies using neuropsychological measures that have examined this hypothesis have failed to find the predicted deficits<SUP>17</SUP>. Thus, research involving more sensitive measures of neurological processes are needed before any firm conclusions regarding etiology can be drawn.</P>

<P>It should also be noted that many previous theories of ADHD have not been supported. Thus, there is no conclusive evidence that ADHD can be caused by diet, hormones, lighting, motion sickness, or bad parenting<SUP>18</SUP>. Given the exciting new advances in our ability to examine the way the brain works, we can be hopeful that continuing research in these areas will soon expand our understanding of the causes of ADHD.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Treatment"></a>
<H3>Treatment Considerations</H3>

<P>One of the most pressing issues in developing effective treatments for children with ADHD,IA has been whether or not these children will show similar responses to stimulant medication as do children with ADHD,C. The best evidence that we have concerning this issue comes from a study in which the responses of children with ADHD,C and children with ADHD,IA were evaluated to 5, 10, and 15 mg doses of methylphenidate (Ritalin)<SUP>19</SUP>. While the groups did not significantly differ on any of the outcome measures, children with ADHD,IA were more likely to be nonresponders (24%) or to respond best to the lowest dose (35%) as compared to children with ADHD,C. In contrast, 95% of the ADHD,C children were judged to be positive responders, with the majority (71%) recommended to receive a moderate or high dose. Thus, it may be that at least a portion of children with ADHD,IA respond favorably to stimulant medication, although at a lower dosage than children with ADHD,C. One factor that may mediate this subgroup's responsiveness is the presence of co-occurring internalizing disorders (e.g., anxiety) when they exist. There is some evidence that children with ADHD who display accompanying internalizing symptoms are less likely to respond positively to stimulant medication than are children who suffer from ADHD alone<SUP>20</SUP>. In any case, stimulant responsiveness is clearly a matter in which more research needs to be done. For any given ADHD child, decisions about the usefulness of medication should be made based on am individual child's responsiveness.</P>

<P>It is likely that the development of other effective treatments for children with ADHD,IA will depend upon the individual pattern of the accompanying problems they display. The information reviewed above suggests several areas of functioning that might be considered relevant for evaluation, including school functioning, the presence of other disorders (e.g., anxiety or depression), and peer relationship problems. Based on assessment in each of these areas, treatment programs can be individually tailored to meet each child's specific needs. As is becoming increasingly clear with children with ADHD,C, it is likely that children with ADHD,IA will be heterogeneous in many ways and that there will be wide individual variation in the types of accompanying problems they display. While we are still in the early stages of understanding the disorder, heightened interest in this area and the recent publication of DSM-IV should lead to increasing knowledge about its causes and responsiveness to treatments.</P>

<a name="Conclusions"></a>
<H3>Conclusions</H3>

<P>The above review addresses research in many areas affecting children with ADHD. While few studies have been conducted using DSM-IV terminology, preliminary reports suggest that the findings are consistent. According to these studies, both ADHD subtypes are generally less popular than their peers, suffer difficulties academically, and frequently display accompanying problems. Given the relatively recent identification of ADHD,IA, it is mandatory that further research be conducted.

<P><I>When parents suspect that their children have difficulty in reading, most parents and teachers take the constructive step of providing more practice in reading at school and at home. When this step is not fruitful, it is time to ask if a learning disability is present. The assessment for problems in reading requires tests for reading and intelligence level. A youngster's reading ability should roughly match his or her intelligence level.</I></P>

<P><I>The general strategy in successful testing in preparation for an IEP is to reveal a clear line of evidence from the difficulty in the classroom to difficulties in underlying skills to impairments in subcomponent skills or associated secondary cognitive skills to impairments in basic cognitive skills. The parent can ask for clarification of what each test directly measures and make meaningful contribution to the assessment process. A few guidelines will help the parent understand how to assess the tests.</I></P>

<P>The first step in the assessment of a reading problem is to determine if the reading level is delayed in comparison to intelligence. There are several different intelligence tests. The choice of which intelligence test to use should be informed by the suspected area of disability. That is, an intelligence test which allows for assessment in an area less affected by the suspected disability should be used. Otherwise, the estimate of intelligence will be contaminated by the disability and decision makers will be possibly caught in a dilemma of what is the level of a student's "real" intelligence. For example, the Wechsler series of intelligence tests have two component scales which combine to make up the "Full Scale IQ" score: a Verbal Scale and nonverbal (Performance) Scale. The student with a language disability may score quite a bit lower on the Verbal Scale, thus lowering the overall "Full Scale" score. On the other hand simply using the Comprehensive Test of Nonverbal Intelligence may substantially bypass the disability. Or, the Stanford Binet IV may allow providing credit for an answer the youngster has difficulty expressing, thereby providing a verbal intelligence score less dominated by expressive-language difficulties.</P>

<P>It should be realized however, that there is no way to entirely bypass a cognitive disability. The brain functions as a unified organ and an injury in one location more or less affects the quality of thinking in all other areas. For example, the difficulty in sequential reasoning and memory which is common to language disorders may affect the ability to reason through a problem in constructing visual patterns. The student may attempt to sequentially think through the steps of a complex problem rather than rely on the innate intuition which might be sufficient for a simple problem. It is just that the "spatial" problems rely less on language or sequential processing skills than expressive-language tasks or other verbal tasks. Any specific test places more or less demand on particular skills but can never be assumed to be totally free of influence from a particular disability.</P>

<P>Once an estimate of intelligence is reached, it can then be used as a comparison for measuring the severity of delay in reading development. The traditional intelligence tests were developed to predict success in school and the achievement test scales are almost always placed on a similar measurement scale so the numbers should match with only slight adjustments.</P>

<P>The test for the assessment of reading level depends on the age of the child. Early elementary children whose curriculum is mainly involved in learning basic reading skills should be assessed in reading word mastery. The ability to rapidly pronounce words is essential for a reading level which can relied on for effortless reading. The Woodcock series reading tests are widely used for this purpose and are very useful in this regard. These tests require that a child correctly read a word within 5 seconds. In another subtest in the Woodcock series, the student is asked to read "nonsense" words so that phonic mastery can be assessed independently of "naming" a word which is visually recognized without sounding out the word. In early grades, some children will have memorized words without really mastering the phonic code; this leaves them vulnerable to reading problems in later grades and ongoing spelling problems. In the need to save time, examiners will often administer the word reading list but not the nonsense word list thereby missing diagnosis of early nonreaders who are simply memorizing words.</P>

<P>The objective in choosing a test is to provide an objective, standardized assessment of the skills needed for success in the classroom or curriculum. When an older student is being asked to read, the youngster is expected to read paragraphs or multiparagraph material. Therefore, an adequate reading assessment must include paragraph reading material. Otherwise, the student is not being assessed on the real requirements for success in the classroom. Success in the task of reading a paragraph or longer material in class or for homework depends on:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> reading speed,<BR><BR>

	<LI> reading accuracy,<BR><BR>

	<LI> the ability to sustain concentration while reading,<BR><BR>

	<LI>comprehension of the material, and<BR><BR>

	<LI> retention of what is read<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>A weakness in any of these factors in reading will lower the likelihood of successful reading. For example, the slow reader will tend to avoid reading because it is too time consuming. Usually more than one reading test will be needed to cover all these areas of reading. The Gray Oral Reading Test-3 measures oral reading speed, reading accuracy, short-term retention, and comprehension. However, some students may be inhibited by the requirement for oral reading and comprehension must be measured through a test which allows for silent reading (such as the Kaufman Test of Education Achievement). However, silent reading does not allow for an assessment of reading accuracy or speed.</P>

<P>The Woodcock Paragraph Comprehension test is not recommended as a measure for paragraph comprehension as most items require reading only a single sentence. If your student is unable to comprehend meaning at this level, then the WJ-R Paragraph Comprehension test would be appropriate. Students with language disorders are prime candidates for this test as they often display difficulties in understanding the subtle meaning of phrases and the meaning carried in sentence structure. However, a paragraph reading test would still be in order to document difficulties at each level of complexity so that all levels can be addressed in the curriculum.</P>

<P>The next step in the assessment process is to specify the underlying cause of the reading problem. Often, an educated guess can be made on the basis of the intelligence test and its component subtests. Often, separate tests will have to be given to document that the impairment in reading is caused by an impaired cognitive process. The underlying problem is often a difficulty in sequential memory although sometimes inadequate hearing discrimination of sounds is the cause. In other cases, memory for what is seen or confusion in right-left directionality can be the culprit. There may be many underlying causes but most can be assessed through the testing process.</P>

<P>In many cases, an attention disorder can impair reading. An attention disorder which is inadequately treated can impair the rate of learning due to difficulties in "working" memory. Working memory is the ability to hold information in mind while you think and is considered to be a core problem for attention disorders. Even with adequate treatment, an attention disorder can also frequently cause disorganization in the expression of complex ideas in writing or impairments in paragraph reading comprehension through inadequate organization of ideas or impaired memory. Attention disorder is an especially important cause of reading problems in teenagers who have not been previously diagnosed with a reading disorder in elementary school.</P>

<P>Sometimes, the teacher reports grade-level reading even though all tests show the student to be a deficient reader. You can ask that the school examiner obtain a tape-recorded sample of reading of never previously read material and a sample that the class has already covered. The reading should be conducted with a awareness by the student that comprehension questions will be asked so that effort to comprehend the material is applied during the reading. You might also ask an independent reading specialist to conduct this assessment and compare performance to age-group expectations.</P>

<P>The student who has been retained presents a problem for examiners. Is the examination to be based on age-level or grade-level norms? Each basis of comparison has its advantages and disadvantages. The retained student should be compared to age-level norms as reading is less tied to specific academic instruction than, say, arithmetic.</P>

<P>Much of learning is self-teaching. The instructor in the classroom can only present a brief exposure to material. A child's ability to learn in the classroom environment depends on the ability to register what the teacher is presenting and integrate that information into what is needed in the reading development process.</P>

<P>Emotional problems can interfere with learning. Often, emotional problems coexist with learning disabilities. It is important to discriminate whether the emotions cause the impairment in learning, are caused by the learning impairment, or are present independent of the learning impairment. To make this discrimination, a careful history and assessment is needed to document the chronology of problems, the nature of the problems, and the situations under which the difficulties are observed. It is useful to document when symptoms are produced: only in the classroom or throughout the student's Iife. Frequently the learning disabled child will be much happier in the summer when not in school. Stomach aches and headaches may occur only on school days. Symptoms which are caused by school problems build up after school starts in September and usually occur only on school days, often after school rather than before school, but anticipatory anxiety can cause problems before school each day.</P>

<P>While it may be tempting to rely on a standard set of reading tests, it is important to use common sense in combination with technical expertise in assessing learning disabilities. The professional can bring the technical expertise to the assessment, but the parent can contribute common sense to the assessment plan. Together, a more meaningful assessment can be crafted.</P>

<P>The effective educator must be ever mindful of the simple fact that children go to school for a living. School is their job, their livelihood, their identity. Therefore, the critical role that school plays in the child's social development and self-concept must be recognized. Even if a child is enjoying academic success in the classroom, his attitude about school will be determined by the degree of social success that he experiences.</P>

<P>There is much that the teacher can do to foster and promote social development in the student. Children tend to fall into four basic social categories in the school setting:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B>REJECTED:</B> Students who ate consistently subjected to ridicule, bullying and harassment by classmates.<BR><BR>

	<LI><B>ISOLATED:</B> Students who, although not openly rejected, are ignored by classmates and are uninvolved in the social aspects of school.<BR><BR>

	<LI><B>CONTROVERSIAL:</B> Students who have established a circle of friends based upon common interests or proximity but seldom move beyond that circle.<BR><BR>

<P><B>Many students with learning disabilities find themselves in the rejected or isolated subgroups.</B> Their reputations as "low status" individuals plague then throughout their school careers. It is important for the teacher to assist the students' classmates in changing their view of this child.</P>

<P><B>Punishment</B> is an extremely ineffective method of modifying bullying or rejecting behavior. If you punish Billy for rejecting Joey, you only increase Billy's resentment of his classmate. However, you can increase a child's level of acceptance in several ways.</P>

<P><B>First, the teacher must become a "talent scout."</B> Attempt to determine specific interests, hobbies or strengths of the rejected child. This can be accomplished via discussions, interviews or surveys. Once you have identified the child's strengths, celebrate it in a very public manner. For example, if the student has a particular interest in citizen band radios, seek out a read-aloud adventure story in which a short-wave radio plays an important role in the plot. Encourage the child to bring his CB into class and conduct a demonstration of its use. By playing the expert role, a rejected or isolated child can greatly increase his status.</P>

<P>Assign the isolated child to a leadership position in the classroom wherein his classmates become dependent upon him. This can serve to increase his status and acceptance among his peers. Be mindful of the fact that this may be an unfamiliar role for him and he may require some guidance from you in order to ensure his success.</P>

<P>Most important, <B>the teacher must clearly demonstrate acceptance of and affection for the isolated or rejected child.</B> This conveys the constant message that the child is worthy of attention. The teacher should use her status as a leader to increase the status of the child.</P>

<P>The teacher can assist the child by making him aware of the traits that are widely-accepted and admired by his peers. Among these traits are:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>smiles/laughs 
	<LI>greets others 
	<LI>extends invitations 
	<LI>converses 
	<LI>shares 
	<LI>gives compliments
</UL>

<P><B>It is important that the teacher recognize the crucial role that the child's parents and siblings can play</B> in the development of social competence. Ask his parents to visit school for a conference to discuss the child's social status and needs. School and home must work in concert to ensure that target skills are reinforced and monitored. Social goals should be listed and prioritized. It is important to focus upon a small group of skills such as sharing and taking turns, rather than attempting to deal simultaneously with the entire inventory of social skills.</P>

<P>Early childhood educators are in a particularly good position to foster the acceptance of the socially incompetent child. By demonstrating acceptance of the child despite his behavioral or language weaknesses, the teacher generally finds that this attitude is mirrored by the child's classmates. The teacher's goals should focus on promoting age-appropriate language/communication skills for the child. This instruction should be provided in a positive, supportive and accepting manner.</P>

<P><B>Assign the troubled child to work in pairs</B> with a high-status child who will be accepting and supportive. Cooperative education activities can be particularly effective in this effort to include the rejected child in the classroom. These activities enable the child to use his academic strengths while simultaneously developing his social skills.</P>

<P>The teacher must constantly <B>search for opportunities to promote and encourage appropriate social interactions</B> for the socially inept child (e.g., "Andrew, would you please go over to Sally's desk and tell her that I would like her to bring me her math folder?"). Have students work in pairs to complete experiments, bulletin boards and peer tutoring.</P>

<P>The student with social skill deficits invariably experiences rejection in any activity that requires students to select classmates for teams or groups. This selection process generally finds the rejected child in the painful position of being the "last one picked." Avoid these humiliating and destructive situations by <B>preselecting the teams or drawing names from a hat</B>. An option is to intervene at the point when six or eight students remain unselected. Arbitrarily assign half of the students to one team and the remaining students to another. This prevents any one student from being in the damaging position of being "last picked."</P>

<P><B>Board games and card games</B> can be used effectively to monitor and foster social development in the classroom. Such activities require students to utilize a variety of social skills (voice modulation, taking turns, sportsmanship, dealing with competition, etc.). These enjoyable activities can also be used to promote academic skills. Because games are often motivating for students, these activities can be used as a positive reinforcer. This setting also provides an opportunity to conduct effective social autopsies. However, these activities should be limited to a few times each week.</P>

<a name="Secondary"></a>
<H3>Working With Secondary Students</H3>

<P>Teachers at the high school level must be particularly aware of the student who is being ignored or rejected by peers. During adolescence, it is critically important that the student be accepted by his classmates. The rejection suffered by adolescents with social skill deficits often places the student at risk for emotional problems. It may be unrealistic to expect an overworked algebra teacher to conduct social skill activities but the professional should, at a minimum, be willing and able to refer the child to appropriate resources in the school administration or guidance department.</P>

<P>The socially incompetent child often experiences isolation and rejection in his neighborhood, on the school bus and in group social activities. The teacher can provide this student with a classroom setting wherein he can feel comfortable, accepted and welcome. In the words of Robert DeBruyn, "Coming to school every day can become a hopeless task for some children unless they succeed at what they do. We teachers are sentries against that hopelessness."</P>

<I>To leave the world a little bit better,<BR>
whether by a healthy child,<BR>
a garden patch,<BR>
or a redeemed social condition;<BR>
To know that even one life has breathed<BR>
easier because you have lived:<BR>
This is to have succeeded<BR>

<P>What new skills will I master during this next school year?  What 
new knowledge will I gain about an area I am interested in?  How 
will I become more effective in working with my classmates?  How 
will I improve my work habits?  </P>

<P>These are the legitimate questions asked by gifted students 
about their own anticipation for school learning, and they nicely 
frame the basic questions that educators must answer to create 
appropriate outcomes for such students.  If gifted students are 
to thrive, there must be in place a coherent curriculum structure 
that defines for teachers, administrators, parents, and the students themselves the goals and purposes of a specialized program, the specific outcomes anticipated, and a prescribed time 
frame for learning.</P>

<a name="Learner"></a>
<H3>Learner Outcomes</H3>
<P>Learner outcomes specify student behaviors we want at a particular developmental point.  These outcomes provide the basis 
for creating worthwhile learning experiences, for setting appropriate expectations, and for assessing the extent of learning attained.  We may want gifted third-grade students to prepare a 
science project using a scientific process, selecting a topic of 
interest, reading a lot about the topic, designing an experiment to 
test a question of interest, completing the experiment, and communicating the results through a poster and oral presentation.  
We may want gifted ninth-grade students to conduct a 
community survey, using basic statistics, on a topic of interest.  
These are examples of gifted learner outcomes.  They each are:</P>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>  appropriately challenging for gifted students at the requisite 
	 stage of development, <BR><BR>
	<LI>  linked to a specific area of study within 
	 the regular school curriculum, <BR><BR>
	<LI>  substantive and worthy of 
	 substantial instructional time and student independent time, and <BR><BR>
	<LI> assessable through authentic approaches.  <BR><BR>
</OL>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Need"></a>
<H3>Need for Learner Outcomes for Gifted Students</H3>

<P>First, every learner needs goals for learning and indicators of 
progress in learning.  Without a clear understanding of what is to 
be learned and how that learning is taking place, the learner loses 
interest, motivation, and comes to see learning as a process devised by others that is trivial, irrelevant, and a waste of time.  
Thus, the first reason for stating learner outcomes is to respond 
to learner needs for making sense of the tasks presented.  
Second, gifted learner outcomes provide a clear differentiation of 
what the students can learn within a given period of time.  Since 
the characteristics of gifted learners imply a capacity to learn 
basic material much faster than other learners and handle more 
complex and sophisticated material at an earlier stage of development, appropriate learner outcomes must reflect these distinctions.  Current state-developed learner outcomes for all students may be well-informed with respect to the state of the art in 
the specific disciplines of language arts, mathematics, science, 
and social studies.  However, the characteristics of exceptional 
learners demand higher expectation levels for performance at 
every level of schooling.  Thus differentiated learner outcomes 
are necessary in order for gifted students to be appropriately 
challenged.  Finally, teachers of the gifted need guidance in 
planning daily curriculum experiences.  Random activities that offer short term appeal are poor fare for the capacities of gifted students.  Activities must be tied to substantive outcomes; they 
must have a purpose larger than themselves.   To facilitate 
worthwhile learning, teachers must be able to see and understand the relationship between a classroom activity and its related outcome.  </P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="How"></a>
<H3>How Learner Outcomes for Gifted Students <BR>
Differ from Generic Outcomes</H3>

<P>Typically, major differences lie in the scope of the outcome, the 
stage of development at which it is expected, and the implicit 
proficiencies necessary to achieve it at an exemplary level.  
Below is a set of ninth-grade English curriculum outcomes for all 
learners juxtaposed with outcomes that were developed specifically for gifted students at that same grade level.</P>

<B>Generic</B>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>   Comprehends a variety of materials.
	<LI>   Is familiar with the structural elements of literature.
	<LI> Develops an understanding of the chronology of American literature.
</OL>

<B>Gifted</B>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>   Evaluates diverse materials according to a set of criteria or 
standards.
	<LI>   Creates a literary work in a self-selected form, using appropriate structural elements.
	<LI>  Analyzes and interprets key social, cultural, and economic 
ideas as expressed in the literature, art, and music of America at 40-year intervals.
</OL>

<P>The examples in the gifted set are consistently more challenging, 
broader in scope, and more focused on specific higher level 
thinking tasks.  They imply that students have mastered the basic underlying skills necessary to undertake required tasks (e.g., 
that students can basically comprehend what they read), and 
demand the development of multiple perspectives within and 
across areas of knowledge.  These aspects of differentiation are 
central in comparing generic and gifted outcome statements.</P>

<a name="Assessment"></a>
<H3>Assessment</H3>

<P>Just as gifted learners need differentiated outcomes, so too, 
must the assessment approach be consistent with the stated 
outcome.  This is different from the way the more generic outcome for all learners would be measured.  The assessment approach should be developed at the same time as the outcome in 
order to maintain unity of purpose and to ensure that the proposed outcome can in fact be satisfactorily assessed.  
Incorporating assessment into the teaching-learning process is 
essential to creating an authentic process. Assessment of outcomes will involve rating student products, whether they are written essays, projects, or original creative work.  </P>

<a name="Teachers"></a>
<H3>How Teachers Can Work with Learner Outcomes</H3>

<P>It is important that teachers see learner outcomes as central to their work in the classroom; that they capture the heart of what 
students need to learn.  For this insight to occur, teachers must 
have the opportunity to engage in the curriculum alignment process.  One approach is for teachers to develop activities that 
underlie each desired learner outcome.  These activities can be 
developed by teams and discussed with other educators at 
appropriate times.  Another approach to alignment is to develop 
suboutcomes that will lead to satisfactory performance at the 
end of the academic year.  Again, teacher teams are the best 
way to accomplish this task, which involves a careful analysis of 
the learner outcome.  A third approach to curriculum alignment is 
to link outcomes to existing classroom materials.  Teachers can 
review basal texts for lessons that support the desired outcome 
and then explore supplemental resources that contribute directly 
to student learning.  </P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Alignment"></a>
<H3>Alignment with Stated Learner Outcomes</H3>

<P>Stated learner outcomes should be the point of departure for 
creating differentiated gifted learner outcomes.  The example 
used earlier is one model for representing the relationship 
between the two sets of learner outcomes.  Some generic learner 
outcomes would not need to be altered or adapted for gifted 
students.  Individual districts would decide which outcomes already meet the criteria of acceptability for the gifted and create 
new ones only where they are needed.  This process of curriculum alignment can be effected for an individual learner as 
well, thus meeting the needs of special populations of gifted 
learners who require even more tailoring in their curriculum.</P>

<P>As educators undertake the task of program planning to accommodate the
diverse abilities students bring to school, they are faced with a
bewildering array of choices. In education for students who are
gifted, a variety of theories and models have been developed.
Instructional methods and materials of all types are presented with
enthusiasm, each claimed to be "ideal" for students of high ability.
To make sound decisions, educators need to understand the components
of an effective educational program for these students.</P>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Constitutes An Effective Program?</H3>

<P>A program "is part of the mainstream of education and doesn't rise and
fall with public opinions" (Morgan, Tennant, &amp; Gold, 1980, p. 2). It
is a comprehensive, sequential system for educating students with
identifiable needs (The Association for the Gifted TAG, 1989); is
often designed by a curriculum committee; and is supported by a
district or school budget. Like literature and mathematics programs,
programs for students with high ability are assumed to be integral
parts of a school curriculum. Teaching strategies may change, but the
question of whether or not they should be a part of the curriculum is
never raised.</P>

<P>A distinction should be made between programs for students who are
gifted students and provisions for these students (Tannenbaum, 1983).
"Provisions are fragmentary, unarticulated, and temporary activities,
which are neither followed-up in any meaningful way nor preceded by
any meaningful lead-in activity" (Morgan, Tennant, &amp; Gold, 1980, p.
2). For example, a teacher with vision and energy might recognize that
a particular student needs to have his or her curriculum modified and
decide to provide special activities. However, unless there is a
commitment on the part of the school system to continue meeting the
student's needs and to offer similar opportunities to other able
students at each grade level, it does not constitute a program. When
budgetary cuts have to be made, enrichment provisions become
expendable.</P>

<H3>What Are the Components of An Effective Program?</H3>

<P>An effective program comprises eight major components. These are
described in the following paragraphs.</P>

<P><B>Needs Assessment.</B> A program is an integrated curriculum response to
the educational needs of a group of students. Therefore, a logical
first step is to determine what needs should be met. Need is defined
as the discrepancy between the current status and a desired status and
indicates a direction in which an individual or school system wants to
move. An effective needs assessment enables educators to gather
information about the nature and instructional needs of the students
and the resources of the school or school district. Information about
community attitudes and teacher skills may also be gathered. Borland
(1989) has provided a list of useful questions that might be asked,
possible sources of information, and ways to obtain it.</P>

<P><B>Definition of Population.</B> A clear definition of the population serves
as the foundation of a program. The definition should be based on
information gleaned from the needs assessment and state and local
requirements. It should address specific abilities and traits
possessed by persons of high ability. In his 1971 Report to Congress,
Marland (1972) included a definition that is well known for its
diversity and usefulness. Updated in 1981 (P.L. 97-35, the Educational
Consolidation and Improvement Act), this definition has provided
guidance to many states. Other programs are based on a
multidimensional view of intelligence (Gardner, 1983; Sternberg,
1985). However, a local frame of reference gleaned from the needs
assessment is equally important.</P>

<P><B>Identification Procedures.</B> The purpose of identification is to locate
students whose needs are not being met by the core curriculum,
evaluate their educational needs, and provide them with an appropriate
program. Identification procedures must be consistent with the
definition in local use and should measure diverse abilities.</P>

<P>Identification is generally divided into several phases that might be
conceptualized as a pyramid. The base of the pyramid involves the
entire student body and is typically called screening. As the process
evolves, the population becomes smaller. The apex of the pyramid
comprises the students who will participate in a program. A wide
variety of instruments and methods are used as the pyramid narrows.
Student records and portfolios, parent and teacher referrals and
recommendations, anecdotal evidence, student products, group tests,
and individual tests are just some of the ways information is gathered
throughout the school year. The identification process should be
ongoing and articulated with curriculum options.</P>

<td valign=top>

<P><B>Program Goals.</B> The goals of a program should be written as clear
policy statements of what the district will do to respond to the needs
of the target population. They should be stated broadly and may refer
to desired student outcomes. Outcomes should reflect the assessed
needs of the students. Since program goals should be made available to
the public, they should be stated in easily understood language. A
comprehensive plan might also state program objectives and suggested
activities. Borland (1989), Clark (1988), Maker (1982),
VanTassel-Baska and colleagues (1988), and other textbook authors have
provided examples of justifiable program goals and objectives.</P>

<P><B>Program Organization and Format.</B> Organization and format refer to
decisions on how students will be grouped for instruction, where
instruction will take place, how often instruction will occur, who
will provide instruction, and who will be responsible for the program
and the administrative organization. Like other program components,
organization and format are derived in part from the needs assessment.
The choice of format(s) involves a number of complex decisions
regarding effective delivery of educational services and includes
fiscal considerations. The central question is, "Which format(s) will
best serve the needs of the defined population(s)?" Special magnet
schools, pull-out programs, a school within a school, full-time
self-contained classes, resource rooms, effective grouping
arrangements based on specific needs, and mainstreaming are just some
of the available options (Cox, Daniel, &amp; Boston, 1985; Daniel &amp; Cox,
1988; Eby &amp; Smutny, 1990).</P>

<P><B>Staff Selection and Training.</B> Selection and training of staff are
crucial to the success or failure of a program for students of high
ability (Renzulli, 1975). But how can an administrator select the
people who will ultimately inspire students and others? Researchers
have consistently identified effective teachers as those who "are all
things to all people." No definitive profile of the ideal teacher for
these students has been published to date. However, interest in and
eagerness to work with students who are curious and highly able are
essential.</P>

<P>As with other program components, staff selection and training should
relate to the needs of the target population. If students are
transported to a central location, they need a teacher who has had
some experience with self-contained classes. Above all, teachers in
programs for students who are gifted should have a demonstrated
understanding of these students (TAG, 1989). If teacher selection
precedes curriculum development, the teacher will have a critical
influence on what will be taught. Because good programs for students
of high ability often grow, it is useful to have a core staff who can
model effective teaching and collaboration for new teachers.</P>

<P><B>Curriculum Development.</B> The most effective curriculum includes
substantive scope and sequence and is based on the needs of the target
population (TAG, 1983; VanTassel-Baska et al., 1988). School systems
that purchase packaged programs should consider whether or not they
are sufficiently rigorous, challenging, and coherent. Appropriate
curriculum produces well-educated, knowledgeable students who have had
to work hard, have mastered a substantial body of knowledge, and can
think clearly and critically about this knowledge.</P>

<P>Maker (1982) has explained how to differentiate curriculum for
students who are gifted in terms of process, content, and product. Her
discussion enables educators to develop appropriate objectives based
on the school system's core curriculum. VanTassel-Baska and colleagues
(1988) have provided theoretical bases, specific procedures, and
practical applications.</P>

<P><B>Program Evaluation.</B> The evaluation component is critical because it
allows a school system to reassess student needs and determine the
efficiency and effectiveness of its various program components
(Callahan, 1983; Callahan &amp; Caldwell, 1986). Evaluation should be both
formative (ongoing) and summative (final outcomes). Evaluation enables
a school system to make midcourse corrections and answers the
question, "Is this program doing what we want it to do?"</P>

<P>MADISON, N.J., June 28 /PRNewswire/ -- Children's Advil(R) (pediatric ibuprofen) was approved for marketing as an over-the-counter medication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Whitehall-Robins Healthcare announced today. Children's Advil is indicated for the temporary relief of fever and the minor aches and pains due to colds, flu, sore throat, headache, and toothache for children two to eleven years of age.</P>

<P>"Since its introduction in 1989, more than seven million prescriptions have been written for Children's Advil Suspension, indicating its acceptance by both physicians and consumers as a safe and effective fever reducer and pain reliever," said Terry Stecz, President, Whitehall-Robins Healthcare. "The recent over-the-counter status of Children's Advil gives parents another choice for treating their children's symptoms and builds upon the heritage of the Advil(R) brand -- the #1 brand of ibuprofen for adults."</P>

<P>Children's Advil offers parents several benefits, including a convenient and effective dosing schedule, demonstrated safety profile, and a delicious fruit-flavored taste.</P>

<P>"Children's Advil is very effective at reducing fever and can be administered every eight hours, unlike Children's Tylenol(R) (acetaminophen), which must be taken every four hours to reduce fever," said Lorraine Stern, M.D., associate clinical professor, UCLA Department of Pediatrics. "Parents can use Children's Advil and feel confident that the child's fever will stay down for up to 8 hours. Their child can take a dose at bedtime and sleep through the night."</P>

<P>In addition to the benefits associated with Children's Advil's convenient dosing schedule, the product has an excellent safety profile, as demonstrated in a recent study of over 83,000 patients in 'The Journal of the American Medical Association.'</P>

<P>Furthermore, published reports of accidental overdose show that children taking up to 44 times the recommended dosage of ibuprofen often experience no adverse side effects. In contrast, acetaminophen has been shown to produce liver toxicity when taken in excess of just 15 times the recommended dosage.</P>

<P>"Many parents are concerned about the dangers associated with inadvertently giving their child too much medication," adds Dr. Stern. "Children's Advil's excellent safety profile can offer parents additional peace of mind regarding their medication choices for their children."</P>

<P>Children's Advil will be available in retail stores soon.</P>

<P>Whitehall-Robins Healthcare, a division of American Home Products Corporation (NYSE: AHP), is a leader in the research and development, manufacturing end marketing of a broad range of consumer healthcare products, with U.S. sales of approximately $1.5 billion. The company's broad lines of nutritionals and over-the-counter medications include many well known brands such as Robitussin(R), Dimetapp(R) and Advil, the leading adult ibuprofen. Advil -- with an 11-year history of proven efficacy and safety as an over-the-counter analgesic for adults -- is recognized in the development end distribution of health and fitness information for consumers and medical professionals, through the Advil Forum on Health Education(TM).</P>

<P>American Home Products Corporation is one of the world's largest research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare products companies and is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications. It also is a leader in women's health products, vaccines, generic pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, agricultural products, animal healthcare, medical devices, infant nutritionals and food products.</P>

<P>FORT WASHINGTON, Pa., June xx /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared Children's Motrin(R) Drops (5O mg per 1.25 mL) and Junior Strength Motrin(R) Caplets (100mg) for over-the-counter (OTC) marketing. Children's Motrin is marketed by McNeil Consumer Products Company, a member of the Johnson &amp; Johnson family of companies. These new products represent another milestone for McNeil and Children's Motrin, which is both the leading prescription end OTC ibuprofen product for children.</P>

<P>"Children's Motrin drops and caplets will offer parents new choices in ibuprofen therapy for children of different weights end ages," said Laura Popper, M.D., a leading New York City pediatrician and author on children's health. "It's an important benefit for parents to have a range of options available to treat their children's fever end pain."</P>

<P>Children's Motrin will be the only OTC pediatric ibuprofen available in liquid suspension, drops and solid dosage formulations. The product line is indicated for use in children between the ages of two to 11 years. It lasts up to eight hours to reduce fever and relieve pain due to colds, flu, sore throat, headaches and toothaches. Children's Motrin Drops provide a more accurate end convenient way to dose younger children. Junior Strength Motrin Caplets are smaller than adult medications and are an ideal choice for older children who can't swallow an adult-sized pill.</P>

<P><B>Children's Motrin -- Leading Pediatric Ibuprofen</B></P>

<P>Children's Motrin was permitted for marketing by prescription for children's fever in 1989 and has become the most widely prescribed brand of fever reducer in the category, with more than 11 million prescriptions written.</P>

<P>Since the product's OTC launch in October, 1995, nearly five million people have used OTC Children's Motrin Liquid Suspension for their children's fever and pain. The product is still available by prescription and continues to be the most widely prescribed and recommended pediatric ibuprofen.</P>

<P>Children who are allergic to aspirin should not use this product, since they may also be allergic to pediatric ibuprofen. Moreover, pediatric ibuprofen should not be taken with any other product that contains ibuprofen or any other pain reliever/fever reducer unless directed by a doctor. Parents also should not administer pediatric ibuprofen if a child is dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, or lack of fluid intake.</P>

<P>Children's Motrin Liquid Suspension is currently available in food, drug and mass merchandise stores Children's Motrin Drops and Junior Strength Motrin Caplets will be available in the same outlets by August.</P>

<P>Children's Motrin is marketed by McNeil Consumer Products Company, which knows children's fever and pain. With its Children's TYLENOL family of products, McNeil has been a leader in the pediatric analgesic category for 35 years.</P>

<P><B>Pediatric Analgesic Leaders</B></P>

<P>Children's TYLENOL has been and continues to be the pediatric analgesic market leader and is the first choice of pediatricians and parents for safe and effective relief of children's fever and pain based on its excellent efficacy and superior safety profile. Children's Motrin, the leading prescription and OTC ibuprofen for children, provides the most comprehensive line of ibuprofen products as an alternative for tough fevers or when longer duration of action is required.</P>

<P>"With both Children's Motrin and Children's TYLENOL, we have been able to provide safe and effective options in a variety of formulations, to help parents relieve their children's fever and pain," said Brian Perkins, President of McNeil Consumer Products Company. "Children's Motrin came to the OTC market with an outstanding prescription heritage, and Children's TYLENOL has been. used safely OTC for 35 years. That kind of history speaks to the strong confidence and satisfaction parents and health professionals have with both products."</P>

<P>McNeil Consumer Products is a member of the Johnson &amp; Johnson family of companies. McNeil makes the TYLENOL(R) line of medications, including Children's TYLENOL, and PediaCare(R) cough, cold and flu products. McNeil is based in Fort Washington, Pa.</P>

<P>HARRISBURG, Pa., July 3 /PRNewswire/ -- The Pennsylvania Dental Association (PDA) reports that a study in March's Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA) indicates the number of school-aged children without cavities in their permanent teeth has doubled in the past two decades.</P>

<P>The researchers found that cavities are still a problem affecting millions of American children and adolescents, but that if these children receive regular dental care -- including dental sealants on appropriate teeth -- the results will be additional declines in the cavity rate.</P>

<P>Researchers at the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) published findings from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) that estimate dental cavity rates for more than 54  million U.S. children and adolescents between the ages of two and 17.</P>

<P>NIDR researchers used baseline data from a study conducted between 1971-74 in which they found that 26 percent of children ages six to 17 were cavity-free in their permanent teeth. In the latest study (NHANES III), scientists found that 55 percent of children between the ages of five and 17 had no cavities in their permanent teeth, more than double the number in the previous study. Researchers also found that more than 60 percent of children under the age of 10 had no cavities in their primary teeth.</P>

<P>One major influential trend in this cavity rate decline emerged from the study. NIDR researchers found that dental sealant use has doubled since the last national survey was conducted -- from 7.6 percent of children ages five to 17 in 1986-87 to 19 percent of children in that group in 1988-91.</P>

<P>Some of the main reasons why the cavity rate has declined significantly over the last 20 years include fluoridated water and fluoridated oral health products, a higher rate of dental visits and improved diets.</P>

<P>The 6300 members of the Pennsylvania Dental Association serve the public by providing preventive and comprehensive dental care.</P>

<P>PHILADELPHIA, June 6 /PRNewswire/ -- In recognition of Children's Day, June 9, child care providers can honor kids by helping to prevent sickness among the children they care for. Children in child care centers average six to eight upper respiratory illnesses and about four gastrointestinal illnesses each year. A key challenge for child care administrators is minimizing the spread of germs which are transmitted most commonly and easily by contact with dirty hands. Cheryl Gelber, Director of Liability at CIGNA Property &amp; Casualty Loss Control Services, offers the following basic health and hygiene tips to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases:</P>

<p><b>Hand Washing</b></P>
 <UL TYPE=DISC>

<LI> Hands should be washed at the beginning of the day, before handling or eating food, after using the restroom, after diapering a child, and after handling other body secretions. Studies have shown that centers that require staff and children to wash their hands properly and frequently cut their incidence of gastrointestinal illnesses in half.<br><br>

<LI> It's effective to wash hands using liquid or powdered soap in a dispenser and paper towels. Using warm, running water and soap, lather both sides of hands, under fingernails, and between fingers for at least 15 seconds; rinse off all soap under running water from wrists to fingertips.<br><br>

<LI> Children and staff should dry hands with paper towels and turn off the faucet with the paper towel to avoid picking up germs on the faucet. After drying, apply hand lotion to prevent dry, cracked, or chapped hands.<br><br>
</UL>

<p><b>Surface Cleaning &amp; Sanitation</b></P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> Every child care center should clean and sanitize surface areas on a regular basis to help kill germs before they spread. Follow cleaning product instructions and be cautious when using ammonia and bleach.<br><br>

<LI> sanitize surfaces with sanitizing solution diluted with the specified amount of water; prepare a fresh batch each day.<br><br>

<LI> Keep cleaning products and sanitizing solutions out of children's reach at all times.<br><br>

</UL>

<p>The term ~CIGNA~ refers to subsidiaries of CIGNA Corporation operating as part of CIGNA Property &amp; Casualty and licensed to offer insurance products and services. CIGNA Corporation itself is not an insurer and does not issue policies. </P>

<P>WASHINGTON, June 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Adolescent parenthood has devastating effects on families, increasing poverty and significantly increasing the likelihood that the children of these young parents will face a life of poor health, physical abuse, neglect, prison and early childbearing, according to a groundbreaking study released today by the Robin Hood Foundation.</P>

<P>"Kids Having Kids" is the most comprehensive report done on the costs and consequences of teenage childbearing to parents, children and society. According to the study, adolescent childbearing costs U.S. taxpayers $6.9 billion per year, and the cost to the nation in lost productivity rises to as much as $29 billion annually.</P>

<P>Working in teams on eight coordinated studies, a collection of some of the nation's leading scholars focused their research on the roughly 175,000 American girls who bear their first baby at the age of 17 or younger and compared the associated economic and social costs to those mothers who delay childbirth until the age of 20 or 21, which is still two to three years younger than the national average.</P>

<P>"Adolescent childbearing is not only a significant personal tragedy, it should be regarded as a national calamity in that it commits young parents to a life of hardship, increases the likelihood that their children will suffer the same fate and has staggering economic and social costs for our nation as a whole," said David Saltzman, executive director of Robin Hood Foundation, a philanthropic organization dedicated to fighting poverty in New York City and primary source of funding for the "Kids Having Kids" report.</P>

<P>"Early parenting wreaks havoc socially -- from the completion of education of the mother and father to their higher poverty rates, said Rebecca Maynard, "Kids Having Kids" editor and professor of education and social policy, Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania. "But the devastation to the lives of their children is prevalent and wide ranging."</P>

<P>A few of the hundreds of findings about children born to teenage mothers:</P>
 <UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> Reproducing the Cycle of Poverty -- The girls born to adolescent moms are up to 83 percent more likely to become teenage moms themselves, thus reproducing the cycle of poverty and disadvantage for yet another generation.<br><br>

<LI>Trouble in School -- They are 50 percent more likely to repeat a grads and perform significantly worse on cognitive development tests. They are also far more likely to drop out of high school than are the children born to women from the same socioeconomic background who wait until the age of 20 or 21 to have children.<br><br>

<LI>More Childhood Health Problems -- They are more likely to be born prematurely and 52 percent more likely to be born low birth weight than if their mothers had waited four years to bear them.<br><br>


<LI>Increased Child Abuse and Neglect -- They are twice es likely to be abused or neglected.<br><br>

<LI> Behind Bars -- The teen sons of adolescent mothers are up to 2.7 times more likely to land in prison than their counterparts in the comparison group. By extension, adolescent childbearing in and of itself costs taxpayers roughly $1 billion each year to build and maintain prisons for the sons of young mothers.<br><br>

<LI>Foster Children -- Of the estimated 472,000 foster children in the United States, over 23,000 are the children of adolescent mothers, which in turn results in a taxpayer burden of approximately $900 million.
<br><br>
</UL>

<P>The study also examines the consequences of early parenting on teen mothers and the fathers:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
 
<LI> 70 percent of the mothers drop out of school.<br><br>

<LI> They are twice as likely to be dependent on welfare.<br><br>

</UL>

<P>A unique component of the study is its examination of the costs and consequences of teen pregnancy on society:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>

<LI> Teen childbearing costs U.S. taxpayers almost $7 billion every year.<br><br>

<LI> The cost to society in lost national productivity and avoidable expenditure of social service resources is as much as $29 billion each year.<br><br>

</UL>

<P>"We hope the disturbing findings of this report will send a wake-up call to America about the need to find workable solutions to the devastating issue of teenage parenthood," said Paul Tudor Jones II, founder and chairman of the Robin Hood Foundation. "Without our help, the children of teenage mothers will themselves become teenage mothers, thus perpetuating the cycle of abuse, neglect, hardship and poverty."</P>

<P>The Robin Hood Foundation was created as a public charity in 1988 to find, fund and provide management help to the best and most innovative programs serving poor people in New York City. Since than, the foundation has provided more than $35 million in money, volunteer resources and materials goods to these programs.</P>

<P>OLYMPIA, Wash., June 26 /PRNewswire/ -- The following was released today by the Washington State Department of Health:</P>

<P>Recent news about imported vinyl miniblinds has renewed concern about the health risks from lead exposure. There have been no confirmed reports in Washington of health problems from miniblinds.</P>

<P>The most common source of lead poisoning among children in Washington is lead-based paint in homes built prior to 1978. Children age six and under are at greatest risk because they have small bodies and frequent hand-to-mouth contact.</P>

<P>"We believe there is some lead-based paint in about 1.6 million older homes," said Lew Kittle, environmental health specialist at the Department of Health. "The most serious hazard occurs when paint peels, chips, chalks or cracks and young children chew these surfaces.'</P>

<P>Kittle warned that lead may also contaminate dust and be ingested when dirty hands or other non-food items come in contact with the mouth.</P>

<P>"Proper nutrition and hygiene can help protect children from lead exposure," said Kittle. "Diets high in calcium and iron act as lead blockers. Washing the hands and face of a child before meals can reduce risk."</P>

<P>To eliminate risk from lead-based paint, cover it with a lead-free paint or remove it using a water-based paint remover. Do not sand, scrape or use a heat gun to remove lead-based paint because the dust and fumes have high levels of toxic lead.</P>

<P>"While lead poisoning is a totally preventable disease, many people are not aware of the problem or its potential consequences to small children," Kittle said. "Long-term exposure to even low concentrations of lead can cause irreversible learning difficulties, mental retardation, and delayed physical and neurological development."</P>

<P>CONTACT: Linda Waring of the Washington State Department of Health, 360-753-3237</P>

<P>NOTE TO EDITORS: For information about lead poisoning, contact LBW Kittle, state Department of Health, 360-753-3855.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. -  As the swimming season begins, the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is re-issuing its
pool barrier guidelines to help prevent about 300
drownings of children each year in residential swimming
pools.  </P>
<P>     Drowning is the leading cause of accidental death in
the homes of children under age 5 in states such as
California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida. In addition, each
year more than 2,000 young children are treated in hospital
emergency rooms nationwide for submersion injuries, such as
brain damage.</P>
<P>     "Supervision is key to preventing a child from drowning
in what is a silent death that happens very quickly," said
CPSC Chairman Ann Brown. "A child can drown in the time it
takes to answer the telephone. Most of the young victims are
missing from sight for less than just five minutes."</P>

<P>     Barriers and pool covers can reduce the risk of child
drownings. CPSC recommends that parents install the
following safety devices to prevent access and give parents
time to locate a child before tragedy strikes:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>A fence or barrier at least 4 feet high with no footholds
	or handholds should surround the entire pool.  <BR><BR>
	<LI>If a wall of the house serves as a side of the barrier,
	the house doors should be protected with alarms.   <BR><BR>
	<LI> In addition to the barriers, a power safety cover should
	protect the pool when it is not in use.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>     "The three barriers that CPSC recommends can buy you
time and may save your child's life," Brown said.</P>
<P>     In addition to installing safety devices, parents can
take other steps to help prevent drownings. CPSC recommends
that parents and other caregivers should learn
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). If a child is missing,
check the pool first. Seconds count in preventing
death or disability.</P>
<P>     CPSC offers consumers two free publications to help
prevent child drownings: "Safety Barrier Guidelines for
Pools" (CPSC362), and "How To Plan For the Unexpected"
(CPSC359). Consumers can obtain copies of the publications
by sending their names and addresses to "Pool Safety," U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, D.C.
20207.</P>
<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death
from 15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's
fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800)
638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To
order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301)
504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the
release number. Consumers can obtain this release
and recall information via Internet gopher services at
cpsc.gov or report product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC), Lerma Import, of Fort Worth, Texas, is
voluntarily recalling about 10,000 pacifiers imported from
Mexico. The pacifiers are banned under the Federal Hazardous
Substances Act because they can break apart, releasing small
parts, which present a choking hazard to young children.</P>

<P>     CPSC and Lerma Import are not aware of any injuries
associated with these pacifiers.  CPSC requested that Lerma
Import conduct this recall to prevent the possibility of injury.
CPSC identified the hazardous pacifiers during routine
surveillance.</P>

<P>     The pacifiers, measuring three inches long and approximately
1.5 inches across the base, are blue or white plastic with a
yellow nipple. The pacifiers have a circular handle.  The
shield is  labeled "Jaloma." The nipples are filled with a sugary
substance.</P>

<P>     The pacifiers are packaged in individual cellophane bags
displayed on a cardboard header labeled in part, "NUEVO CHUPON
*** NEW PACIFIER *** HECHO en MEXICO *** Laboratories Jaloma, S. 
A.  de C.  V. *** Aguiles Serdan 438 Guadalajara 44380 Ja.
***." Retail stores in the Dallas, Texas area sold the pacifiers
from May 1995 through May 1996 for $.25 each.</P>
  
<P>     Consumers should immediately take the pacifiers away from
small children and return the pacifiers to the store where
purchased for a full refund. For more information, consumers
should call Lerma Import at (817) 624-3404.</P>

Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Man's Trading Co. of San
Francisco, Calif., is voluntarily recalling about 15,000
train-shaped "Rolling Clock" toys. If the toy is dropped, it

the side of the train reads "FUNNY TRAIN" in red lettering.</P>
<P>     The train is packaged with four plastic rings on a
white plastic tray in a yellow box with pictures of blue
trains, pink elephants, and white dogs, and numbers from
zero through nine. The box is labeled in part, "ROLLING

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC), Irwin Sports of Toronto, Ontario, is
announcing the recall of about 8,400 faceguards for model CL87
baseball catchers' combination faceguard and helmet. Adjusting
the wire faceguard too low on the helmet could allow a ball to
pass through the faceguard, which could lead to serious injuries
to the face or head.</P>

<P>     Irwin Sports has received two reports of facial injuries
when the faceguard was misadjusted on the helmet.</P>

<P>     The recalled faceguard is attached to either a red, navy,
royal or black helmet with "Cooper - Made in Canada - CL87"
printed on both sides of the helmet. The back of the helmet also
has a white warning label next to the words "Little League
Approved - CL87."</P>

<P>     Sporting goods stores sold the CL87 combination
helmet/faceguards nationwide from October 1995 through May 1996
for about $ 35.00 each.</P>

<P>     Consumers should stop using the CL87 Combination
helmet/faceguard immediately and return the faceguard portion to
the store where it was purchased for a free wire faceguard
replacement which will prevent a baseball from passing through
it.</P>

<P>     For more information, consumers should call Irwin Sports at
(800) 268-1732 or write the company at Irwin Sports, 43 Hanna
Avenue, Toronto, Canada, M6K 1X6.</P>

<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the

<P>Parents have the wonderful opportunity and responsibility for
nurturing children. This nurturing process takes place in several
areas of development: physical, emotional, and intellectual. While
parents can usually find time to read a story to their children,
thereby instilling a love for literature, they are often at a loss
as to how to instill a love and appreciation for mathematics.</P>

<P>Like reading, mathematics is a subject that is indeed necessary for
functioning adequately in society. More than that, mathematics is
a subject that should be more enjoyable than it sometimes is. The
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) has identified
the appreciation and enjoyment of mathematics as one of the
national goals for mathematics education. This goal, coupled with
the task of nurturing children's confidence in their ability to
apply their mathematical knowledge to solve real-life problems, is
a challenge facing every parent today.</P>

<P>This digest presents resources that will enable parents to fulfill
their responsibility for developing their children's abilities to
do mathematics, while at the same time encouraging more positive
attitudes toward mathematics. The resources are divided into three
areas: (1) activities initiated in the home; (2) activities
initiated at school; and (3) special curriculum development
projects that promote parent involvement.</P>

<a name="Activities"></a>
<H3>Activities In the Home</H3>

<P>There are methods by which parents can easily become involved in
their children's mathematics education. Several resources provide
parents with games and activities that engage children in
mathematical thinking and problem solving and, at the same time,
build their self-confidence and appreciation for mathematics. An
example of this type of resource is the book Helping Your Child
Learn Math. Published by the U.S. Department of Education, the book
contains 26 activities for children aged 5 to 13. The activities
illustrate the mathematics that children can experience at home, at
the grocery store, and while traveling. Some meaningful activities
on a long car trip can alleviate the boredom that so often results
in children fighting with each other or asking repeatedly, "Are we
there yet?"</P>

<P>Parents' attitudes toward mathematics have an impact on children's
attitudes. Children whose parents show an interest in and
enthusiasm for mathematics around the home will be more likely to
develop that enthusiasm themselves. You Can Help Your Young Child
Learn Mathematics, available in both English and Spanish, helps
parents communicate the importance of mathematics to their children
and become more involved in their children's mathematical
education. This book discusses ways that parents can help their
children develop good study habits, and it presents activities
through which families can make mathematics a part of their daily
lives as they travel, cook, garden, and play games.</P>

<P>Reading to children is a treasured activity in many homes. What
better way to integrate mathematics into the lives of children than
to read them stories that bring mathematical ideas to life?
Children's books related to mathematics can be separated into four
categories: counting books, number books, storybooks, and concept
books. A bibliography of 159 children's books that make a
significant connection with mathematics, compiled by Stavroula K.
Gailey and published in the January 1993 issue of the Arithmetic
Teacher, provides many excellent suggestions for mathematical
children's literature to read at home.</P>

<P>Math Matters: Kids Are Counting on You is a resource kit prepared
by the National Parent Teacher Association for parents who feel
inadequate in helping their children with mathematics. The kit's
planning guide describes how local PTAs can use the kit to
encourage elementary school parents to become more involved with
their children's mathematics education. The kit contains the
planning guide, a booklet with 70 suggested math activities for the
home, a four-fold brochure summarizing the kit and its purpose, two
posters, math stickers, and a 7-minute videotape about the role of
parents in opening up opportunities for their children in
mathematics.</P>

<P>Although more expensive and requiring extra equipment, technology
can be utilized by parents to provide mathematical activities for
their children. The best software packages are user friendly and
highly interactive, and they offer problems that challenge both
students and parents. One exemplary software is The Factory by
WINGS. Available in both English and Spanish, this software
simulates the operation of a factory production line and requires
the user to solve problems involving flaws in production. Another
potential resource is the public library, where mathematics videos
and computer software are available for use at home or in the
library.</P>

<a name="Working"></a>
<H3>Working With Your Child's Classroom Teacher</H3>

<P>Besides the mathematics learning that takes place at the parent's 
initiative, there are many opportunities for parents and teachers
to work cooperatively in enriching children's experience with
mathematics. These situations are likely to be the most profitable
for two reasons. First, children generally want to please both
their parents and their teachers. If they see that mathematics is
important to both their parents and their teacher, they will
consider it important for themselves too. Second, extending
mathematical concepts from the classroom to home will establish the
idea that mathematics is not just a school subject, but an everyday
subject that makes life more interesting and understandable.</P>

<P>Parents who want to become more involved in their child's
mathematical education, but who are hesitant to take the initiative
on their own, may want to look to the teacher for guidance.
Teachers can provide assistance in: (1) setting up a system of home
study; (2) helping parents understand the sequencing of
mathematical skill development; (3) suggesting materials and
activities that are entertaining and suitable for their child's
level and which can be done in a reasonable amount of time; (4)
providing clear guidelines on how to use materials; (5) giving
feedback on the successes and failures of home activities; and (6)
knowing when to stop working with a child on an activity so that a
good working relationship is maintained.</P>

<P>Resources for this collaborative effort are myriad. For the
elementary grades, the Arithmetic Teacher (recently renamed
Teaching Children Mathematics) is a reliable resource for materials
that establish the parent/teacher/student connection. Every month
the "Ideas" section contains activities for grades K-8 and an
activity for the home, all related to a common topic. Another
example is the "Math Backpack," described in the February 1993
issue of the Arithmetic Teacher. The Math Backpack contains samples
of activities that second-graders can do in their classroom, then
take home and share with their parents. The backpacks familiarize
parents with teaching techniques, give children an opportunity to
demonstrate their understanding of mathematical concepts, and
engage both parents and children in investigative activities. One
backpack included activities for subtraction, pattern blocks,
measurement, and telling time.</P>

<P>For the middle school level, a new journal published by NCTM,
called Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School, features a "Menu
of Problems," including appetizers (easy, motivational problems),
main courses (robust, solid content problems), and desserts
(challenging, intriguing problems). Another monthly feature is the
"Mathematics Investigator," which focuses on uses and abuses of
mathematics in the media.</P>

<P>In working with teachers, parents should not forget the
opportunities that homework assignments offer. Studies have shown
that parents' participation in students' homework can increase
achievement. Moreover, the effect of that involvement will be
maximized if parents and teachers work together toward common
goals. It is important for parents to understand the system the
teacher is using to assign and evaluate homework, as well as the
methods being used to teach mathematical concepts. Helping children
with homework can be counterproductive if parents are working at
cross purposes with the classroom teacher.</P>

<a name="Programs"></a>
<H3>Programs Promoting Parent Involvement</H3>

<P>The professional mathematics education community is in the process
of making changes in curriculum, instruction, assessment, and in
the level of parent involvement. Over the past decade, increasing
emphasis has been placed on the need to enhance children's
problem-solving capabilities by teaching from a hands-on
perspective. Teachers are being asked to incorporate manipulatives
and technology into their instruction, and programs are being
developed that incorporate parental involvement in reaching these
goals.</P>

<P>Examples of such programs are Family Math and Family Computers,
both developed by Project EQUALS to help parents teach their
children mathematics. Besides providing learning activities that
parents can do with their children, Project EQUALS provides
information on equity issues in mathematics education, builds
awareness of the importance of problem-solving skills and the
ability to talk about mathematics, and helps parents develop a
positive attitude toward their role in their children's
mathematical education.</P>

<P>Programs often emerge from special needs. Many of the programs in
the resource list below address the need to improve the
participation and achievement of females and minorities in
mathematics. All, however, stress the indispensable part that
parents can play in nurturing success in mathematics for their
children.</P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>     Most parents will agree that it is a wonderful experience
to cuddle up with their child and a good book. Few people will
say that about flash cards or pages of math problems. For that
reason, we have prepared this booklet to offer some math
activities that are meaningful as well as fun. You might want
to try doing some of them to help your child explore
relationships, solve problems, and see math in a positive
light. These activities use materials that are easy to find.
They have been planned so you and your child might see that
math is not just work we do at school but, rather, a part of
life.</P>

<P>     It is important for-home and school to join hands. By
fostering a positive attitude about math at home, we can help
our children learn math at school.</P>


<H3>It's Everywhere! It's Everywhere!</H3>


<P>     Math is everywhere and yet, we may not recognize it
because it doesn't look like the math we did in school. Math in
the world around us sometimes seems invisible. But math is
present in our world all the time--in the workplace, in our
homes, and in life in general.</P>

<P>     You may be asking yourself, "How is math everywhere in my
life? I'm not an engineer or an accountant or a computer
expert!" Math is in your life from the time you wake until the
time you go to sleep. You are using math each time you set your
alarm, buy groceries, mix a baby's formula, keep score or time
at an athletic event, wallpaper a room, decide what type of
tennis shoe to buy, or wrap a present. Have you ever asked
yourself, "Did I get the correct change?" or "Do I have enough
gasoline to drive 20 miles?" or "Do I have enough juice to fill
all my children's thermoses for lunch?" or "Do I have enough
bread for the week?" Math is all this and much, much more.</P>


<H3>How Do You Feel About Math?</H3>


<P>     How do you feel about math? Your feelings will have an
impact on how your children think about math and themselves as
mathematicians. Take a few minutes to answer these questions:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>   Did you like math in school?
	
	<LI>  Do you think anyone can learn math?
	
	<LI> Do you think of math as useful in everyday life?
	
	<LI>  Do you believe that most jobs today require math skills?

</UL>

<P>     If you answer "yes" to most of these questions, then you
are probably encouraging your child to think mathematically.
This book contains some ideas that will help reinforce these
positive attitudes about math.</P>


<H3>You Can Do It!</H3>


<P>     If you feel uncomfortable about math, here are some ideas
to think about.</P>

<P>     Math is a very important skill, one which we will all need
for the future in our technological world. It is important for
you to encourage your children to think of themselves as
mathematicians who can reason and solve problems.</P>

<P>     Math is a subject for all people. Math is not a subject
that men can do better than women. Males and females have
equally strong potential in math.</P>

 

<P>     People in the fine arts also need math. They need math not
only to survive in the world, but each of their areas of
specialty requires an in-depth understanding of some math, from
something as obvious as the size of a canvas, to the beats in
music, to the number of seats in an audience, to
computer-generated artwork.</P>

<P>     Calculators and computers require us to be equally strong
in math. Theft presence does not mean there is less need for
knowing math. Calculators demand that people have strong mental
math skills--that they can do math in their heads. A calculator
is only as accurate as the person putting in the numbers. It
can compute; it cannot think! Therefore, we must be the
thinkers. We must know what answers are reasonable and what
answers are outrageously large or small.</P>

<P>     Positive attitudes about math are important for our
country. The United States is the only advanced industrial
nation where people are quick to admit that "I am not good in
math." We need to change this attitude, because mathematicians
are a key to our future.</P>

<P>     The workplace is rapidly changing. No longer do people
need only the computational skills they once needed in the
1940s. Now workers need to be able to estimate, to communicate
mathematically, and to reason within a mathematical context.
Because our world is so technologically oriented, employees
need to have quick reasoning and problem-solving skills and the
capability to solve problems together. The work force will need
to be confident in math.</P>

 

<H3>Build Your Self-Confidence!</H3>


<P>     To be mathematically confident means to realize the
importance of mathematics and feel capable of learning to</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>  Use mathematics with ease;

	<LI>  Solve problems and work with others to do so;<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>   Demonstrate strong reasoning ability;<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>  See more than one way to approach a problem;<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>   Apply mathematical ideas to other situations; and<BR><BR>

	<LI>   Use technology.<BR><BR>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. After testing and analyzing imported vinyl
miniblinds, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
has determined that some of these blinds can present a lead
poisoning hazard for young children. Twenty-five million
non-glossy, vinyl miniblinds that have lead added to stabilize
the plastic in the blinds are imported each year from China,
Taiwan, Mexico, and Indonesia.</P>
<P>     CPSC found that over time the plastic deteriorates from
exposure to sunlight and heat to form lead dust on the surface of
the blind.  The amount of lead dust that formed from the
deterioration varied from blind to blind.</P>
<P>     In homes where children ages 6 and younger may be present,
CPSC recommends that consumers remove these vinyl miniblinds.
Young children can ingest lead by wiping their hands on the
blinds and then putting their hands in their mouths. Adults and
families with older children generally are not at risk because
they are not likely to ingest lead dust from the blinds.</P>
<P>     Lead poisoning in children is associated with behavioral
problems, learning disabilities, hearing problems, and growth
retardation. CPSC found that in some blinds, the levels of lead
in the dust was so high that a child ingesting dust from less
than one square inch of blind a day for about 15 to 30 days could
result in blood levels at or above the 10 microgram per deciliter
amount CPSC considers dangerous for young children.</P>
<P>     "Some of the vinyl blinds had a level of lead in the dust
that would not be considered a health hazard, while others had
very high levels," said CPSC Chairman Ann Brown. "Since consumers
cannot determine the amount of lead in the dust on their blinds,
parents with young children should remove these vinyl miniblinds
from their homes."</P>
<P>     CPSC asked the Window Covering Safety Council, which
represents the industry, to immediately change the way it
produces vinyl miniblinds by removing the lead added to stabilize
the plastic in these blinds. Manufacturers have made the change
and new miniblinds without added lead should appear on store
shelves beginning around July 1 and should be widely available
over the next 90 days.</P>
<P>     Stores will sell the new vinyl blinds packaged in cartons
indicating that the blinds are made without added lead. The
cartons may have labeling such as "new formulation," "nonleaded
formula," "no lead added," or "new! non-leaded vinyl
formulation."  New blinds without lead should sell in the same
price range as the old blinds at about $5 to $10 each.</P>
<P>     CPSC recommends that consumers with young children remove
old vinyl miniblinds from their homes and replace them with new
miniblinds made without added lead or with alternative window
coverings. Washing the blinds does not prevent the vinyl blinds
from deteriorating, which produces lead dust on the surface.</P>
<P>     The Arizona and North Carolina Departments of Health first
alerted CPSC to the problem of lead in vinyl miniblinds. CPSC
tested the imported vinyl miniblinds for lead at its laboratory.</P>
<P>     The laboratories of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and
the Army's Aberdeen Test Center used electron microscope
technology to confirm that as the plastic in the blinds
deteriorated, dust formed on the surface of the blind slats. This
testing also established that the dust came from the blinds and
not from another source.  CPSC laboratory tests confirmed that
this dust contained lead.</P>
<P>     "This lead poisoning is mainly a hazard for children ages 6
and younger," said Chairman Brown. "Adults and older children
generally are not at risk because they are not likely to ingest
lead dust from the blinds."</P>
   <P>  The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the
public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death from 15,000
types of consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction. to
report a dangerous product or a product-related injury and for
information on CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline
at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To
order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051
from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release
number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall information
via Internet gopher services at cpsc.gov or report product
hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</P>

<P><i>"We want kids outside in the sunshine, not inside in an
emergency room," said CPSC Chairman Ann Brown. </i> </P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
(CPSC) announced today that safety equipment for baseball
could significantly reduce the amount and severity of
58,000 (or almost 36 percent of) baseball-related injuries
to children each year. </P>
<P>     Baseball, softball, and teeball are among the most
popular sports in the United States, with an estimated 6
million children ages 5 to 14 participating in organized
leagues and 13 million children participating in non-league
play. In 1995, hospital emergency rooms treated 162,100
children for baseball-related injuries.</P>
<P>     At a press conference at Camden Yards stadium, home of
the Baltimore Orioles, CPSC released the findings from its
one-year study on the ability of protective equipment,
including softer-than-standard baseballs, safety release
bases, and batting helmets with face guards, to reduce
injuries to children playing baseball.  </P>
<P>     "CPSC is the federal agency responsible for overseeing
the safety of 15,000 different types of consumer products,
including sports equipment and products claiming to reduce
injuries and increase safety," said CPSC Chairman Ann Brown.
"Parents need to know what options they have in protective
equipment so they can make the best decisions for their
children playing baseball."</P>
<P>     Nick Senter, executive director of the Dixie Baseball
League, an organization based in 11 Southern states, and
Richard Bancells, trainer of the Baltimore Oriole's baseball
team, joined Chairman Brown for today's announcement.</P>
<P>     Senter said, "Since we began using batting helmets with
face guards in the Dixie League, we've seen a drop in both
injury rates and insurance rates." </P>
<P>     CPSC collected and analyzed data on baseball, softball,
and teeball-related deaths and injuries to children to
determine specifically how these children were injured and
what safety equipment could prevent such injuries. CPSC also
studied voluntary safety standards and reviewed published
scientific literature evaluating currently available
protective equipment.</P>
<P>     CPSC analyzed the 88 reports it received of
baseball-related deaths of children between 1973 and 1995.
It found that 68 of the deaths were caused by ball impact
and 13 were caused by bat impact. Of the 68 ball impact
deaths, 38 resulted from blows to the chest while 21 deaths
were caused by a ball hitting a player's head.</P>
<P>     Of the 162,100 hospital emergency-room-treated injuries
in 1995, most of the injuries (almost 75 percent) occurred
to older children ages 10 to 14. This age group represents
about half of the total number of children playing baseball.</P>
<P>     Of the total number of injuries to children, CPSC
considers about 33 percent severe, including fractures,
concussions, internal injuries, and dental injuries. The
remaining 67 percent less severe injuries include
contusions, abrasions, lacerations, strains, and sprains.
More than 50 percent of the children under age 11 who were
injured while playing baseball sustained injuries to the
head and neck area, while a larger percentage of older
children sustained injuries to their arms and legs.</P>
<P>     Based on its analyses, CPSC found that three pieces of
safety equipment will help reduce injuries.
Softer-than-standard baseballs and softballs, which have a
softer, spongier core than standard baseballs and softballs,
can reduce ball impact injuries. Face guards that
attach to batting helmets and protect the face can reduce
injuries to batters. </P>
<P>     Safety bases that release from their anchor can reduce
sliding injuries. Safety release bases that are based on
age, gender, and skill levels of the players provide the
best protection.</P>

<H3>Study Overview on Baseball Deaths, Injuries, and
Protective Equipment</H3>
                    
<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is
releasing the results of a one-year study on the ability of
safety equipment to reduce baseball injuries and deaths. The
study found that injuries to children playing baseball could
be reduced by the use of softer-than-standard baseballs,
face guards on batting helmets, and safety release bases.
CPSC's baseball project found that protective equipment
could significantly reduce the number and severity of 58,000
or almost 36 percent of baseball-related injuries to
children each year. </P>
     
<P>     Baseball, softball, and teeball are among the most
popular youth team sports in the United States. CPSC
estimates that 6 million children ages 5 to 14 participate
each year in organized leagues, while another 13 million
children participate in non-league play. </P>

<P>     Baseball leads team sports in deaths to children with
three to four deaths each year.  The sport ranks third in
annual injuries to children following basketball and
football. In 1995, hospital emergency rooms treated an
estimated 162,100 children for baseball-related injuries. </P>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
     
<P>     CPSC is the federal agency responsible for overseeing
the safety of 15,000 different types of consumer products,
including sports equipment and products claiming to reduce
injuries and increase safety.</P>

<P>     CPSC collected and analyzed data on baseball, softball,
and teeball-related deaths and injuries to children ages
5-14 to determine specifically how these children were
injured and what safety equipment could prevent such
injuries. CPSC also studied voluntary safety
standards and reviewed published scientific literature
evaluating currently available protective equipment,
including softer-than-standard baseballs and softballs, face
guards for batting helmets, and modified safety bases. This
study analyzed injuries to children playing baseball
in organized league play and informal recreational backyard,
school, and neighborhood play. </P>

<a name="Analysis"></a>
<H3>Analysis of Death and Injury Data  </H3>
     
<P>     CPSC collected information on deaths from death
certificates, the agency's Medical Examiners and Coroners
Alert Project, consumer complaints, and news clips.</P>

<P>From 1973 to 1995, CPSC received reports of 88
baseball-related deaths to children.</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> 68 deaths or 77 percent from ball impact
	<LI> 13 deaths or 15 percent from bat impact
	<LI> 7 deaths or 8 percent cause unknown  
	
</UL>

<P>The 68 ball impact deaths break down as follows:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>  38 deaths or 56 percent to the chest
	<LI>  21 deaths or 31 percent to the head
	<LI>  9 deaths or 13 percent to other areas
	
</UL>

<P>     To obtain information on how baseball-related injuries
to children occur, CPSC used injury data from April 1995 to
August 1995 from hospital emergency rooms collected by the
agency's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System also
know as NEISS. CPSC completed a telephone survey of 348
NEISS cases of injured children answering questions
(with parental permission) or with parents answering
questions about their children's injuries and use of
protective equipment. </P>

<P>     Hospital emergency rooms treated about 162,100 children
ages 5 to 14 for baseball-related injuries in 1995. Most of
the injuries, almost 75 percent, occurred to the older
children ages 10 to 14, representing about half of the total
number of children in this age group.</P>

<P>     Of the total number of injuries to children, CPSC
considers about 33 percent as severe, including fractures,
concussions, internal injuries, and dental injuries. The
remaining 67 percent of the less severe injuries include
contusions, abrasions, lacerations, strains, and
sprains. More than 50 percent of the children under age 11
who were injured while playing baseball sustained injuries
to the head and neck area, while a larger percentage of
older children sustained injuries to their shoulders, arms,
and legs.</P>

<h3>Analysis of Baseball Protective Equipment</h3>

<b>Softer-than-Standard Baseballs and Softballs</b>

<P>     Ball impact injuries to the head and chest are the most
severe and frequent of all baseball injuries. Ball impact to
the chest accounted for 38 deaths, while ball impact to the
head accounted for 21 deaths. Of the 88,700 ball impact
injuries, which account for 55 percent of all hospital
emergency-room-treated baseball injuries, 54 percent (or
47,900 ball impact injuries) were to the head and neck.
35,200 ball-impact injuries to the face occurred
during organized play. </P>

<P>     Official major and youth league standard baseballs have
a core of cork or rubber, which is wound with natural or
synthetic fibers, such as wool or cotton, and covered with
two pieces of leather sewn together with 108 stitches.
Softer baseballs have a much larger core made of soft,
spongy natural or synthetic substances, such as soft
polyurethane, rubber, or kapok, with no winding, and a
cover. Softer-than-standard softballs have a spongier core
than standard softballs. </P>
     
<P>     Softer-than-standard baseballs and softballs may reduce
the risk and severity of 47,900 hospital
emergency-room-treated injuries to children being hit by the
ball, particularly to the head and neck. CPSC found that 97
percent of ball impact injuries where the child identified
the type of ball involved a standard ball. The percent of
hospital emergency-room-treated injuries involving softer
balls were lower than their share of the market, and
injuries from softer balls were less severe than those from
standard balls. Softer-than-standard baseballs and
softballs are available nationwide at prices that are
competitive with standard baseballs and softballs.</P>

<P>     CPSC studied all available scientific literature on the
softer-than-standard baseball, including published articles
suggesting that softer balls may increase the risk of death
from ball impact to the chest. CPSC commissioned expert
reviews of these articles, which found that the biological
and biomechanical models used to mimic chest impact deaths
in children were not accurate representations of the way
death occurs to children on the baseball field. The agency
has found no convincing evidence that softer balls increase
the risk of chest impact death. In contrast, an expert
review determined that softer-than-standard baseballs can
reduce head injuries. </P>

<P><b>Face Guards for Batting Helmets</b></P>

<P>     In 1995, children received an estimated 3,900 hospital
emergency-room-treated injuries to the face while at bat.
Face guards attach to batting helmets to protect the face,
including the eyes, nose, mouth, jaw, and cheeks. </P>

<P>     The face guards currently on the market must be
installed or attached to a batting helmet. They are made
from clear polycarbonate plastic or plastic coated wire and
retail for about $10. CPSC found that none of the injured
players it studied received facial injuries while wearing
batting helmets with face guards.</P>

<P>     CPSC has determined that the current ASTM voluntary
standard for face guards is effective in preventing facial
injuries. According to the standard, the face guard must
prevent the ball from touching the face. Although youth
leagues generally require children to use batting helmets,
only one league requires batting helmets with face guards. </P>

<P><b>Safety Release Bases</b></P>

<P>     In 1995, sliding injuries accounted for about 13,000
hospital emergency-room-treated injuries or 8 percent of the
total number of injuries to children playing baseball. Of
these sliding injuries, about 8,200 or 63 percent were
caused when children slid into the base with 80 percent or
6,600 of these base-contact sliding injuries occurring
during organized play.  Girls appear to be at a higher risk
of injury from base-contact sliding injuries than boys.</P>

<P>     CPSC studied several styles of modified safety bases to
determine which would reduce the risk of injury from sliding
into the base. For reducing the risk of sliding injuries,
CPSC recommends one style of a safety base with the
following characteristics: releases from its
anchoring system upon impact; leaves no holes in the ground
or parts of the base sticking up from the ground when the
base is released. Since girls appear to be at higher risk,
models based on age, gender, and skill levels of the players
may provide the greatest level of protection. </P>

<P>     The list price for a set of safety release bases ranges
from $300 to $595 compared with $150 for a standard
three-base set, although these safety bases tend to outlast
regular bases. In addition, currently available safety
release bases with the recommended characteristics require
permanent installation in the ground.</P>

<P>WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., June 20 /PRNewswire/ -- Pack up those picnic baskets, strap on your bathing suits and head outdoors to enjoy all of the fun that the summer season brings. But wait! Before you go, make sure to guard yourself against the pesky creatures and toxic plants that get us itching and scratching!</P>

<P>Dr. Stephen Pennisi, toxicologist and itch expert at the Lanacane Itch Information Center, recommends that before you head outdoors, taking some simple precautions will help keep your summer itches to a minimum:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>When going outdoors for prolonged periods of time, make sure to pack insect repellent and apply as directed. <BR><BR>

	<LI>Light citronella candles to ward off bugs during barbecues and other outside events.<BR><BR>

	<LI>When cooking or eating outdoors, cover food and beverages so bees
	are not attracted.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Always keep topical anti-pruritics (anti-itch medications) handy.
		A product such as Lanacane Creme with benzocaine acts as a
		topical anesthetic that will numb the pain and itch immediately.<BR><BR>
		
	<LI>Those people who are allergic to bee stings should carry an
	 Epikit (a bee sting emergency kit). These are available by
	 prescription. People who experience tightness in the chest,
	 breathing problems or nausea following a bee/wasp sting should
	 seek emergency treatment.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>Learn what toxic plants look like so you can avoid them in the
	 outdoors.<BR><BR>

<P>CLEVELAND, June 21 /PRNewswire/ -- Summer has finally arrived! While a welcome relief to some after the long winter and soggy spring, the five-day forecast for soaring temperatures and high humidity poses potential health risks, especially to the elderly.</P>

<P>When air temperatures rise, older adults are at risk because aging reduces the body's ability to cool off. Normal aging reduces the effectiveness of the body's defense mechanisms by raising the temperature threshold for sweating, thirst and heat-related discomfort. This situation can result in the occurrence of heat illness.</P>

<P>According to David Pelini, M.D., chairman of the Fairview Health System's Department of Emergency Medicine and Richard Treat, M.D., director of Trauma and Surgical Critical Care at Fairview Health System, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are a threat to older people when they are exposed to excessive heat. "Heat stroke is specially dangerous and can even be life-threatening," they caution.</P>

<P>Last summer in Chicago alone, 733 people died of heat-related causes such as heat stroke and heart attack. Three-quarters of the victims were over age 65. "Heat-related deaths are especially tragic because they can nearly always be prevented. But excessive heat can impair judgment and cause confusion, so precautions must be taken before you get too hot," they say.</P>

<P>Heat stroke is the most serious form of heat-related illness. Symptoms of heat stroke include confusion, combativeness, strong rapid pulse, dry skin or lack of sweating and possible delirium or coma. "Individuals experiencing these symptoms should seek immediate medical attention at a hospital emergency department," recommends Pelini. Onset can be rapid, with progression to a life-threatening state within minutes.</P>

<P>Heat exhaustion is a less severs form of heat injury and occurs when the body is too hot. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include excessive thirst, profuse sweating, muscle cramps, dizziness, vomiting, fatigue and fainting. The skin usually feels cold and clammy to the touch. To help avoid heat-related illness and survive the heat this summer, Pelini offers these tips:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>  Drink plenty of liquids, even if you're not thirsty.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>  Dress in light-weight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing.<BR><BR>
		
	<LI> Avoid midday heat and do not engage in vigorous activity during the hottest part of the day, between noon and 4 p.m.<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  Wear a hat or umbrella to block the sun's rays.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI> Eat light. Avoid hot, heavy meals and opt for foods high in water content: fruits, salads and soups.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI> Use air conditioning. If the temperature is 90 degrees F or above, fans alone usually cannot protect against heat-related illness. If you don't have a unit at home, you can benefit by spending time at the movies, library or in any air-conditioned building.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  Take baths and showers. Because water conducts heat away from the body, bathing in tepid water is a good cooling technique.<BR><BR>
	 
</UL>

<P>Although older individuals need to be careful in hot weather, they can still enjoy a happy and healthy summer by taking a few extra safety precautions, according to Drs. Pelini and Treat.</P>

<P>PHILADELPHIA, June 12 /PRNewswire/ -- During the hot summer days that lie ahead, many people will turn to swimming pools to cool off. Unfortunately, many swimmers are injured in pool-related accidents. Cheryl Gelber, Director of Liability at CIGNA Loss Control Services, offers the following tips to help prevent accidents in swimming pools open to the public:</P>

 <UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> Surround swimming areas with a minimum four-foot-high, or higher if local codes require it, "child-proof" fence with a self-locking gate that is kept secured when the pool is not in use and a certified lifeguard is not present.<br><br>

<LI> Children's "kiddie" pools should be separated from regular pool operations by a fence.<br><br>

<LI> Post rules for the pool conspicuously and enforce them consistently. Do not allow boisterous play, toys, or surfboards in the pool.<br><br>

<LI> Walking surfaces in the swim area must be smooth, level, and slip-resistant.<br><br>

<LI> Clearly mark the deep end of the pool (more than five feet) either by a life line or a painted line contrasting with the pool bottom.<br><br>

<LI> The pool floor should be light in color to help identify objects in the pool.<br><br>

<LI> Plainly mark water depth in feet above the water level on the vertical pool wall and on the coping or deck next to the pool.<br><br>

<LI> Keep a throwing rope with attached life ring and other life saving equipment where it is easily accessible and have a certified lifeguard on duty at all times that the pool is open. Require qualified adult supervision for small children.<br><br>

<LI> Clean the pool each day and test water quality during the day at regular intervals determined by local pool codes.<br><br>

<LI> Pool lighting is required if the pool remains open after sunset.<br><br>

<LI> Ground fault interrupters should be present and tested monthly to help prevent electrical shock around the pool area.<br><br>

<LI> Keep a private, working telephone near the pool with a list of important telephone numbers, such as hospital and ambulance, readily accessible.<br><br>

<P>HARRISBURG, Fa., June 5 /PRNewswire/ -- Baby bottles emblazoned with soft drink logos are among the latest fad items selling in discount and toy stores across the country. Members of the Pennsylvania Dental Association (PDA) and other health-care professionals are concerned that parents and caregivers will be encouraged to give infants soft drinks in these bottles, increasing the likelihood of baby bottle tooth decay.</P>

<P>Baby bottle tooth decay is a condition that can destroy the teeth of an infant or young child. It is the result of teeth being exposed for long periods of time to liquids containing sugars. Sugars are used by bacteria in the mouth as an energy source. In the process, the bacteria produce acids which lead to cavities over time.</P>

<P>Many sweet liquids cause these problems, including milk, formula and fruit juices. And it's not just what is in a child's bottle that causes decay, but how often and for how long. Giving a child a bottle of sweetened liquid many times a day is not a good thing. Allowing the child to fall asleep with a bottle during naps or at night can also harm the child's teeth.</P>

<P>To help keep baby bottle tooth decay from affecting your child, the FDA encourages parents and other caregivers to follow these tips:</P>
 <UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> After each feeding, wipe the baby's gums with a clean, damp washcloth or gauze pad. Begin brushing the child's teeth when the first tooth appears. Clean and massage gums in areas that remain toothless, and begin flossing when all the baby teeth have come in.<br><br>

<LI> Never allow your child to fall asleep with a bottle containing milk, formula, fruit juice or sweetened liquids. If your child needs a comforter between regular feedings, at night, or during naps, fill a bottle with cool water or give the child a clean pacifier recommended by your dentist or physician. Never give your child a pacifier dipped in any sweet liquid and always avoid filling your child's bottle with liquids such as sugar water and soft drinks.<br><br>

<LI> If your local water supply does not contain fluoride, ask your dentist how your child should get it.<br><br>

<LI> Start dental visits by the child's first birthday. Make visits regularly. If you think your child has dental problems, take the child to the dentist as soon as possible.<br><br>
</UL>

<P>The 6,300 members of the Pennsylvania Dental Association serve the public by providing preventive and comprehensive dental care.</P>

<P>     Many educators and parents assume that young children must
progress through a sequence of clearly defined skill areas to
acquire listening, speaking, reading, and, finally, writing
facility. As a result, young children often are not encouraged to
write until they have learned how to read and have mastered the
mechanics of writing (grammar, capitalization, punctuation).</P>

<P>     Recent studies in emergent literacy--the early stages of
learning to write and read--have shown that young children
compose before they know much about the conventions of writing
and reading or have the skill to control the formation of
letters. As young children gradually realize the usefulness of
writing--even unconventional writing--they are encouraged to
develop related literacy skills.</P>

<a name="High"></a>
<H3>High/Scope's Approach to Emergent Literacy</H3>

<P>     A developmental approach to literacy emphasizes the gradual
emergence of skills in all areas of language rather than the end
results of this process: formal skills in speaking, reading, and
writing. Such a developmental approach is used by the High/Scope
Educational Research Foundation in Ypsilanti, Michigan.
High/Scope curriculum developers and teaching adults recognize
that preschoolers and kindergartners have plenty of ideas and
enjoy composing and reading their compositions. </P>

<P>     Children in High/Scope preschool and kindergarten
classrooms, centers, and homes often write and read in
unconventional forms (scribblings, drawings, letter-like marks)
in order to relate their thoughts and experiences. Such attempts
to communicate are not viewed as mistakes. Instead, young
children are encouraged to "write" without worrying about the
mechanics of writing. However, teachers and parents don't adopt a
hands-off or laissez-faire approach to literacy development.
Instead, they support the naturalness of learning about reading
and writing by enriching the atmosphere in which children live
and learn. In such an enriched atmosphere, authentic reasons for
learning to write and read are readily apparent to children, and
they have opportunities to hear good literature and use language
in many forms to accomplish tasks.</P>

<P>     In High/Scope learning settings, children are given numerous
opportunities to observe purposeful writing. For example, on the
first day at the High/Scope Demonstration Preschool, each child
chooses an identification symbol that is used to label his or her
cubby, artwork, and other belongings. Children's symbols are
usually drawings of shapes or familiar objects (for example, a
circle, star, or tree). Each child's symbol is displayed on an
identification sign that also includes the child's name and
photo. Children use their symbols daily. </P>

<P>     Teachers and other adults involve children in writing
messages, notes to parents, and lists of things to do. Because
the symbols and processes of writing are commonplace in
High/Scope early learning environments, children can observe the
relationship between spoken and written language. Preschools,
kindergartens, and day care homes or centers have some type of
"writing area" or "office center." In a preschool or day care
program, the writing area may simply be an informal arrangement,
such as a table with writing implements and materials. In a
kindergarten, it may be a full-fledged activity area. Whatever
the setting, the place where children are encouraged to "write"
should be stocked with a variety of writing tools. Most
important, it should be a place where children feel free to write
in their own way.</P>

<P>     Children who respond in such a setting by saying "I can't
write" or "I don't know how," or who assume that an adult will
automatically write for them, will soon learn that the adults
believe that the children can write. Adults respond warmly to all
attempts children make to write, even when these attempts result
in the random scribbles, letter-like marks, and drawings that
children call writing. Adults ask such open-ended questions as,
"Tell me what you've written" or "That's interesting . . . what
about this part?" When adults respond positively to all efforts
at written language, children learn that their decision to take a
risk with writing was worthwhile.</P>

<P>     Even casual observers of young children's writing will see
that they often combine conventional and unconventional print.
Some preschoolers, and many kindergartners, know how to write
their names conventionally. However, most preschoolers are more
comfortable with scribbling their messages or attempting
representational drawings than with trying to write in
conventional form. Occasionally, preschoolers will move on to
forming letter-like units or even a letter or two from their
names. At the beginning of the school year, some kindergartners
will be able to string nonphonetic letters together in imitation
of print. As the year progresses, some will begin to invent the
spelling of isolated words and compile lists of words they know.</P>

<P>     It's important for adults to recognize that such
experimentation at the preschool and kindergarten levels allows
children to use comfortable, nonconventional forms of writing to
express complex thoughts. By encouraging children to write in
their own way, adults assure that the composition process as a
whole does not stand or fall on children's knowledge of, or skill
in, conventional writing.</P>

<a name="Understanding"></a>
<H3>Understanding the Connections Between Drawing, Writing, and Reading</H3>

<P>     When adults use the teaching techniques of the emergent
literacy approach, they understand the relationships between
children's drawing, writing, and reading. They realize that some
children may consider their drawings to be actual writing. If
asked to "read" their text, these children will respond with a
clear message or story. Older children may recognize that drawing
is an illustrative form, but still continue to use it as writing. 
It is important to resist the pressure to introduce skill and
drill practice in children's early years. Forcing young children
to practice writing out-of-context words they do not understand
and cannot read; suggesting that they print letters so that they
fit in lined spaces; insisting that words always be spelled
conventionally; and overemphasizing practice with discrete letter
and sound relationships will not make children become better
writers and readers. In fact, such demands may make it less
likely that children will develop a pleasurable association
between reading and writing.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Supporting"></a>
<H3>Supporting Children's Writing</H3>

<P>     The process of learning to write begins in infancy. The
positive oral and written language experiences children have at
home, day care, preschool, and kindergarten contribute to the
developing capacity to communicate in writing.</P>

<P>     Adults in day care settings and preschools can promote the
development of writing skills by offering numerous informal
opportunities for children to observe, explore, and experiment
with writing. When children observe that adults are writing in
order to accomplish real tasks, they learn the value and function
of writing. Caregivers can involve the children in writing brief
notes to parents or listing the foods that are to be purchased
for the next day's snack time. It's a good idea to have a box of
writing tools and materials available for children to use when
they want to write their own way. The materials can be arranged
on a special table set aside for this purpose. </P>

<P>     Although informal opportunities to write should continue at
the kindergarten level, it's also appropriate for adults to begin
to provide slightly more formal and organized opportunities. For
example, adults can set aside a special time when children are
asked to work in the "office center." The office center can also
be available as an option for children at work time. In the
office center, children should easily find everything they need
to write names, design signs, send notes, record telephone
numbers, or write stories.</P>

<P>     Although many kindergartners can recognize some letters,
words, and phrases, they may revert to drawing or scribbling when
encouraged to write a story. Adults should accept this as a
valuable attempt at writing and avoid prodding children to write
only in words.</P>

<P>     In the course of the year, some kindergartners will
experiment with phonetic spelling and begin to move closer to
conventional forms. Teachers should treat such developments as
part of the natural process of emerging literacy. Attempts to use
emerging skills should be warmly supported, not pushed or
scrutinized for errors. The developmental approach emphasizes
learning experiences that are meaningful to children, and not
drill and practice of isolated skills.</P>

<P>American Children Must Be Ready To Learn From the First Day of School.  And
Of Course, Preparing Children For School Is a Historic Responsibility of
Parents.</P>

<P>TEST.  It's a loaded word.  Important...something to care 
about...something that can mean so much we get apprehensive 
thinking about it.</P>

<P>Tests are important, especially to school children.  A test may
measure a basic skill.  It can affect a year's grade.  Or, if it
measures the ability to learn, it can affect a child's placement
in school.  So it's important to do well on tests.</P>

<P>Besides, the ability to do well on tests can help throughout life
in such things as getting a driver's license, trying out for
sports, or getting a job.  Without this ability, a person can be
severely handicapped.</P>

<P>Your child can develop this ability.  And you can help the child
do it.  Just try the simple techniques developed through Office of
Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) research.  This
leaflet tells you how.</P>

<a name="Why"></a>
<H3>Why Test?</H3>

<P>It's helpful for a child to understand why schools give tests. 
And to know the different kinds of tests.</P>

<P>Tests are yardsticks.  Schools use them to measure, and then
improve education.  Some tell schools that they need to strengthen
courses or change teaching techniques.  Other tests compare
students by schools, school districts, or cities. All tests
determine how well "your child" is doing.  And that's very 
important.</P>

<P>Most of the tests your child will take are "teacher-made." 
That is, teachers design them.  These tests are associated with
the grades on report cards.  They help measure a student's
progress--telling the teacher and the student whether he or she
is keeping up with the class, needs extra help, or, perhaps, is 
far ahead of other students.</P>

<P>Now and then your child will take "standardized" tests.  These 
use the same standards to measure student performance across the
country.  Everyone takes the same test according to the same
rules.  This makes it possible to measure each student's
performance against that of others.  The group with whom a 
student's performance is compared is a "norm group" and consists 
of many students of the same age or grade who took the same test.</P>

<hr>

<a name="Ask"></a>
<H3>Ask the School</H3>

<P>It could be useful for you to know the school's policies and
practices on giving standardized tests and the use of test scores. 
Ask your child's teacher or guidance counselor about the kinds of
tests your child will take during the year--and the schedule for
testing.</P>

<P>One other thing:  some schools give students practice in taking
tests.  This helps to make sure that they are familiar with
directions and test format.  Find out whether your child's school
gives "test-taking practice" on a regular basis or will provide
such practice if your child needs it.</P>

<a name="Avoid"></a>
<H3>Avoid Test Anxiety</H3>

<P>It's good to be concerned about taking a test.  It's not good to
get "test anxiety."  This is excessive worry about doing well on a
test and it can mean disaster for a student.</P>

<P>Students who suffer from test anxiety tend to worry about success
in school, especially doing well on tests.  They worry about the
future, and are extremely self-critical. Instead of feeling
challenged by the prospect of success, they become afraid of
failure.  This makes them anxious about tests and their own
abilities.  Ultimately, they become so worked up that they feel
incompetent about the subject matter or the test.</P>

<P>It does not help to tell the child to relax, to think about
something else, or stop worrying.  But there are ways to reduce
test anxiety. Encourage your child to do these things:</P>

<UL>
<LI>    Space studying over days or weeks.  (Real learning occurs
     through studying that takes place over a period of time.)
     Understand the information and relate it to what is already
     known.  Review it more than once.  (By doing this, the
     student should feel prepared at exam time.)<BR><BR>

<LI>    Don't "cram" the night before--cramming increases anxiety
     which interferes with clear thinking.  Get a good night's
     sleep.  Rest, exercise, and eating well are as important to
     test-taking as they are to other school work.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Read the directions carefully when the teacher hands out the
     test.  If you don't understand them, ask the teacher to
     explain.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Look quickly at the entire examination to see what types of
     questions are included (multiple choice, matching, true/
     false, essay) and, if possible, the number of points for
     each.  This will help you pace yourself.<BR><BR>
<LI>    If you don't know the answer to a question, skip it and go
     on.  Don't waste time worrying about it.  Mark it so you can
     identify it as unanswered.  If you have time at the end of
     the exam, return to the unanswered question(s).<BR><BR>
</UL>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Do"></a>
<H3>Do's and Don't's</H3>

<P>You can be a great help to your children if you will observe these
do's and don't's about tests and testing:</P>

<UL>
<LI>    Don't be too anxious about a child's test scores.  If you put
     too much emphasis on test scores, this can upset a child.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Do encourage children.  Praise them for the things they do
     well.  If they feel good about themselves, they will do their
     best.  Children who are afraid of failing are more likely to
     become anxious when taking tests and more likely to make
     mistakes.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Don't judge a child on the basis of a single test score. 
     Test scores are not perfect measures of what a child can do. 
     There are many other things that might influence a test
     score.  For example, a child can be affected by the way he or
     she is feeling, the setting in the classroom, and the
     attitude of the teacher.  Remember, also, that one test is
     simply one test.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Meet with your child's teacher as often as possible to
     discuss his/her progress.  Ask the teacher to suggest
     activities for you and your child to do at home to help
     prepare for tests and improve your child's understanding of
     school work.  Parents and teachers should work together to
     benefit students.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Make sure your child attends school regularly.  Remember,
     tests do reflect children's overall achievement.  The more
     effort and energy a child puts into learning, the more likely
     he/she will do well on tests.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Provide a quiet, comfortable place for studying at home.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Make sure that your child is well rested on school days and
     especially the day of a test.  Children who are tired are
     less able to pay attention in class or to handle the demands
     of a test.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Give your child a well rounded diet.  A healthy body leads to
     a healthy, active mind.  Most schools provide free breakfast
     and lunch for economically disadvantaged students.  If you
     believe your child qualifies, talk to the school principal.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Provide books and magazines for your youngster to read at
     home.  By reading new materials, a child will learn new words
     that might appear on a test.  Ask your child's school about a
     suggested outside reading list or get suggestions from the
     public library.<BR><BR>
</UL>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="After"></a>
<H3>After the Test</H3>

<P>It's important for children to review test results. This is
especially true when they take teacher-made tests.  They can learn
from a graded exam paper.  It will show where they had difficulty
and, perhaps, why.  This is especially important for classes where
the material builds from one section to the next, as in math.
Students who have not mastered the basics of math will be unable
to work with fractions, square roots, beginning algebra, and so
on.</P>

<P>Discuss the wrong answers with your children and find out why they
answered as they did.  Sometimes a child misunderstands the way a
question is worded or misinterprets what was asked.  The child may
have known the correct answer but failed to express it effectively.</P>

<P>It's important, too, for children to see how well they used their
time on the test and whether guessing was a good idea.  This helps
them to change what they do on the next test, if necessary.</P>

<P>You and the child should read and discuss all comments written by
the teacher.  If there are any comments that aren't clear, the
child should ask the teacher to explain.</P>

<P>     Readiness is a term used to describe preparation for what
comes next: readiness for kindergarten involves both the child
and the instructional situation. Any consideration of the
preparation a child needs to be successful in kindergarten must
take into account the kindergarten program and the teacher's
expectations of the child. </P>
<a name="Social"></a>
<H3>Social and Behavioral Expectations</H3>

<P>     Kindergarten teachers expect that the children will be able
to function within a cooperative learning environment in which
the child works both independently and as a member of small and
large groups. Children are expected to be able to attend to and
finish a task, listen to a story in a group, follow two or three
oral directions, take turns and share, and care for their
belongings. They are also expected to follow rules, respect the
property of others, and work within the time and space
constraints of the school program. It is important that children
learn to distinguish between work and play, knowing when and
where each is appropriate within the definition of each (Bradley,
1984; LeCompte, 1980).</P>

<a name="Sensory"></a>
<H3>Sensory-Motor Expectations</H3>

<P>     Teachers expect children to develop certain physical skills
before they enter kindergarten. Children are expected to have
mastered many large muscle skills such as walking, running, and
climbing, and fine motor skills requiring eye-hand coordination,
such as use of a pencil, crayons, or scissors. Fine motor skills
are used when the child begins to write its name and to make
attempts at written expression. It is assumed that children have
acquired both visual and auditory discrimination of objects and
sounds. Such discrimination skills will be used to learn the
names and sounds of letters and the names and quantities of
numerals. Children are expected to have developed the concepts of
same and different, so that they can sort objects into groups
whose members are alike in some way. Usually the kindergarten
teacher expects the children to recognize and name colors,
shapes, sizes, and their own names (even though these concepts
are often part of the curriculum early in the school year).</P>

<a name="Cognitive"></a>
<H3>Cognitive and Language Expectations</H3>

<P>     Most five-year-olds can express themselves fluently with a
variety of words and can understand an even larger variety of
words used in conversations and stories. If children have been
exposed to books and heard stories read and told, they have begun
to develop an interest in what print says and how it is used to
express ideas; a concept of story and story structure; and an
understanding of the relationship between oral and written
language.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>
<a name="Chronological"></a>
<H3>Chronological Age</H3>

<P>     Many school systems and states have raised the entrance age
for kindergarten in hopes that the older age of the class will
increase the likelihood of the children's success. However,
research does not support this action. Most studies show that
chronological age alone is not a factor in success in
kindergarten (Meisels, 1987; Wood, 1984).</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>
<a name="Kindergarten"></a>
<H3>Kindergarten Curriculum</H3>

<P>     Many children now have a prior group experience in nursery
school, prekindergarten, or day care. In the past, when
kindergarten was the child's initial school experience, its focus
was on the child's social adjustment to school. Kindergarten was
usually a half-day program whose curriculum and activities were
separate from the rest of the school, and whose purpose was to
prepare the child for first grade. Now kindergarten is an
integral part of the elementary school's curriculum and the focus
has shifted from social to cognitive or academic (Nurss and
Hodges, 1982). Many states fund full-day kindergarten programs on
the assumption that five-year-olds can benefit from a longer
school experience. Kindergartens vary in the degree to which
their cognitive skills are strengthened through a developmentally
oriented program with language-based, concrete activities. In
many kindergartens, language, cognitive, sensory-motor, and
social-emotional skills are addressed through play. Small group
instruction, learning centers, and whole group language
activities are used as systematic, planned opportunities for the
children to develop in all areas.</P>

<P>     In some cases, however, the kindergarten uses structured,
whole group, paper-and-pencil activities oriented to academic
subjects, such as reading and mathematics. The curriculum in
these kindergartens often constitutes a downward extension of the
primary grade curriculum and may call for the use of workbooks
which are part of a primary level textbook series. Many early
childhood professionals have spoken out on the inappropriateness
of such a curriculum and have urged widespread adoption of a
developmentally appropriate kindergarten curriculum (Bredekamp,
1986).</P>

<P>     The question of readiness for kindergarten depends in part
on which type of program the child enters. Different approaches
to reading and writing, for example, make different demands on a
young child. A child may be ready for one type of instructional
program, but not another.</P>

<P>     A further issue is that of the expectations of the teachers
and school system for what the child will accomplish by the end
of kindergarten. As expectations become more academic and
assessments more formal (for example, standardized tests that
compare children to a national sample of kindergarten children)
pressure increases to retain children who do not meet
expectations or to place them in a transition class between
kindergarten and first grade. The assumption is that children who
have not achieved a minimum level of cognitive and academic
skills prior to first grade will benefit from another year of
kindergarten. While that may be true for some, it is not true for
many others (Shepard, 1987). Developmentally appropriate
programs assume that children vary upon entrance; that all
children progress during the program at their own rates and in
their own manner; and that children will continue to vary at the
end of the program.</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>     Readiness for kindergarten depends on a child's development
of social, perceptual, motor, and language skills expected by the
teacher. It also depends on the curriculum's degree of structure,
the behavior required by the instructional program, and
expectations of what is to be achieved by the end of the program.</P>

<P>BALTIMORE, June 11-- Each year, more than 900 teenagers drown. Although the drowning rate for teens has dropped 300 percent over the past 60 years, it remains second only to motor vehicle accidents as a leading cause of unintentional death by injury. Eighteen-year-old males have the highest drowning rate, a fact that researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health attribute to a propensity among boys to engage in risky behavior.</P>

<H3>Why do so many adolescents drown?</H3>

<P>"Adolescents often choose to swim in remote -- and usually unsupervised -- places such as lakes, rivers, canals, and the ocean," says Gordon Smith, MO, associate professor in Health Policy and Management at the School. "Eighty-two percent of adolescent drownings occur in these places."</P>

<P>Remote waters can contain submerged rocks, strong undertows, and rough waters. They are also ideal places to drink alcohol without getting caught. Researchers suspect this is one reason that a reported 44 percent of boys and 33 percent of girls swim most often in remote areas without a lifeguard or other supervision.</P>

<P>Alcohol is a factor in about 40 percent of adolescent drownings. Drinking impairs swimming ability end judgment, and may hinder a person's ability to recover after being submerged. Alcohol my also delay laryngospasm, a protective reflex that closes the opening to the lungs to prevent water from entering.</P>

<H3>Is knowing how to swim protection against drowning?</H3>

People who know how to swim aren't necessarily safe, says Ds. Smith. Various studies show that 15 to 45 percent of those who drown know how to swim. Swimmers' risk increases simply because they are more likely than nonswimmers to be in the water. Also, swimmers may put themselves at risk by being over-confident about their abilities and taking more chances. However, the Red Cross still recommends that anyone who is likely to play in or around the water receive water safety training that includes swimming lessons and rescue techniques.</P>

<H3>What can a bystander do?</H3>

<P>Get the victim out of the water as soon as possible. Victims are most likely to survive without brain damage if they are submerged for less than five minutes. "When people are submerged for more than 25 minutes, death or brain damage is almost guaranteed," says Dr. Smith. One study found that irreversible brain damage or death can occur after as few as nine minutes under water. All victims submerged for more than one minute should be hospitalized to watch for swelling of the lungs or brain.</P>

<P>If a victim isn't breathing, give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation immediately. This is more important than trying to expel water from the victim's lungs. Most experts agree that the Heimlich Maneuver should be used only if something is blocking the airway (many people mistakenly believe it should be done right away to rid the lungs of water).</P>

<P>If there's no pulse, start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) at once. one study showed that victims under age 15 who survived near-drowning without brain damage were almost five times more likely to have received CPR from a bystander than victims who later died or had brain damage. Have someone called the paramedics while CPR is being given, and cover the victim for warmth. </P>

<P>Finally, if the victim vomits (50 percent do) turn him on his side so he doesn't choke.</P>

<P>ARLINGTON, VA. -- Playgrounds offer kids the chance to enjoy the fresh air and stretch their muscles, but adults need to be aware of potential hazerds. The best way to keep children safe on playgrounds is for adults to be informed. The National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) and its National Playground Safety Institute (NPSI) offer tips and advice for parents and caregivers to help keep kids safe.</P>

<P>"It's important for adults to check the playground for potential hazards, and to check their childron as well," said Ken Kutska, certified leisure professional and NRPA's immediate past president. "How a child is dressed plays an important role in his or her safety. For example, drawstrings on clothing, such as hooded coats and sweatshirts, should not be worn because they may get caught on the equipment causing a serious -- if not fatal -- injury."</P>

<P>NRPA and NPSI offer these additional playground safety tips for perents:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>  Inspect the playground before play.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>  Supervise children while they play.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>  Be sure children use playground equipment appropriate for their age.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>  Be sure children use the playground equipment for its intended purpose only. Check that all elevated surfaces have chest-high guard rails. Watch for potential trip hazards such as rocks, tree stumps and concrete footings.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>  Be sure that all openings are less than three-and-one-half inches wide or greater than nine inches wide to prevent head entrapment.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>  Check that each piece of equipment is surrounded by a minimum six-foot fall zone covered with an appropriate amount of resilient surfacing such as sand, pea gravel, or hardwood fiber/mulch.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>  Make sure playgrounds are well maintained. Report any problems.<BR><BR>

</UL>

<P>The Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that more than 150,000 children are injured on playgrounds each year in the United States. NRPA recommends that parents and caregivers contact the playground owner or operator if they suspect potential danger to children. Taking the time to check for hazards on playgrounds is critical to a child's safety.</P>

<P>"Playgrounds provide an important social and physical environment for the development of children. They offer kids the chance to exercise, be outside in the fresh air and socialize with other children," said Kutska. "It is the responsibility of parents and caregivers to keep playgrounds safe so children have the opportunity to cake advantage of all the benefits playgrounds have to offer. "</P>

<P>Public playgrounds are not the only play areas that present hazards for children. Home playgrounds can also be potentially dangerous. Parents are urged to follow these home playground safety tips:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Check that your back yard is large enough for playground equipment. Your site must provide good visibility and security.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Watch out for obstacles, such as the garage, tree branches, utility poles and wires, located near the playground site before setting up the equipment.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Be sure your child's weight and age fall within the manufacturer's recommended limits for the equipment.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Review the manufacturer's literature: it should reference product compliance with the ASTM F1148 Safety Standard for Home Playground Equipment.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Make sure the playground equipment is clearly visible for proper supervision.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Read and follow the manufacturer's directions when setting up equipment.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Check that the installation is level, well drained and anchored to meet manufacturer's specifications.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Make sure each piece of equipment has an adequate fall zone covered with an appropriate amount of resilient surfacing such as sand, pea gravel or hardwood fiber/mulch.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Check that your child is dressed appropriately for the playground -- clothing with hoods or drawstrings can cause strangulation<BR><BR>
	
</UL>

<P>NRPA is a national, non-profit service organization dedicated to extending the personal, environmental, social and economic benefits of parks and recreation through its network of recreation and park professionals and civic leaders. There are approximately 23,000 NRPA members, including national, state and local experts on recreation, at-risk youth, crime, health, aging, environmental and urban planning. NRPA's World Wide Web site is located at http://www.nrpa.org/nrpa.</P>

<h3>HOME Playground Safety Tips</h3>


<P>When you set up your home playground, be sure to follow these tips:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Check that your back yard is large enough for playground equipment. Your site must provide good visibility and security.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Watch out for obstacles, such as the  garage, tree branches, utility poles and wires, located near the playground site before setting up the equipment.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Be sure your child's weight and age fall within the manufacturer's recommended limits for the equipment.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Review the manufacturer's literature: it should reference product compliance with the ASTM F1148 Safety Standard for Home Playground Equipment.<BR><BR>

	<LI>Make sure the playground equipment is clearly visible for proper
	supervision.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Read and follow the manufacturer's directions when setting up
	equipment.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Check that the installation is level, well drained and anchored to meet
	manufacturer's specifications.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Make sure each piece of equipment is surrounded by an adequate fall zone covered with an appropriate amount of resilient surfacing such as sand, pea gravel, or hardwood fiber/mulch.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Check that your child is dressed appropriately for the playground- clothing with hoods or drawstrings can cause strangulation.<BR><BR>
</UL>

</p><br>

<h3>PUBLIC Playground Safety Tips:</h3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Elevated surfaces must have chest-high gaurd rails.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Openings should be less than 3 1/2 inches or greater than 9 inches to prevent head entrapment.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Supervise children at all times.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Each piece of equipment must be surrounded by a minumum 6 foot fall zone covered with an appropriate amount of resilient surfacing such as sand, pea gravel, or hardwood fiber/mulch.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Avoid strangulation hazards such as drawstrings.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Watch for trip hazards.<BR><BR>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>There are more than 3,000 colleges and universities in the United States.
Choosing among them is a complex task.   Recruiting procedures and a wide
variety of publications such as college viewbooks offer idyllic scenes of
campus life, but do little to clarify student decision making.  The increasing
number and variety of books on how to get accepted by the college of your
choice adds to the anxiety and expectations.  Unless the match between
institutions and students is truly a good one, both are likely to be
disappointed.</P>
<P>        Gifted and talented (GT) students often have problems beyond those
of most other students who consider college and career choices.  A
systematic, collaborative approach is needed whereby students learn that
college planning is part of life career development; it need not be a finite
event that begins and ends mysteriously or arbitrarily. </P>

<a name="Learning"></a>
<H3>Learning About Oneself:  A 6-Year Process</H3>

<P>A coherent, programmatic approach to college planning provides
opportunities for students to obtain information from counselors, other
adults, and peers who understand their needs and who will listen to them,
interpret and clarify their experiences, and discuss their concerns about
changing self-concepts.  Programs should include students who are
identified as gifted (generally through IQ scores) but who may not be
achieving academically.  Students can learn about themselves, their
community, and career options in a wide variety of ways. <I>College
Planning for
Gifted Students</I> (Berger, 1989) provides detailed information.  </P>

<P><B>Seventh and Eighth Grades.</B>  Guidance activities emphasize
self-awareness,
time management, work/study skills, and an introduction to career
awareness.  Students develop a 4- to 6-year academic plan and decision-
making skills.  Participation in regional talent searches is encouraged, and
students are provided with information on the Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT) and/or the American College Test (ACT), the screening instruments
employed by talent searches. Planning for advanced courses often begins
as early as the eighth grade, especially in the case of sequential courses
such as mathematics, languages, and sciences.  Many students will not be
ready or able to begin a sequence.  In such cases, summer programs,
sponsored by regional talent searches or by-mail courses provided by
some regional talent search programs may be a viable option.</P>

<P><B>Ninth and Tenth Grades.</B>  Guidance activities continue to help
students
clarify intellectual and social/emotional experiences, establish a sense of
identity and direction, and set short- and long-term goals. Students are
encouraged to identify and pursue interests.  By 10th grade, they become
aware of how their academic subjects, values, interests, and goals relate to
careers.  They also begin to learn that some interests and talents develop
into artistic or scientific convictions while others develop into leisure
activities.</P>

<P><B>Eleventh and Twelfth Grades. </B>Guidance activities include
arranging for
mentor relationships and internships.  Through group workshops, students
learn how colleges make selections, who is involved in the admissions
process, how students are evaluated, and what they can offer that a college
requires and desires.  They learn about the application process and how to
present themselves so that the institution will recognize them as a good
match.</P>
<P>        Parents can support an effective guidance program by participating in
school career centers and providing students with opportunities for
enrichment.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<a name="Colleges"></a>
<H3>Learning About Colleges
</H3>
<P>Learning about colleges is a two-step process.  Step 1 involves collecting
general information by reading, talking with people (asking questions), and
visiting colleges. By the end of 11th grade, the student should be able to
develop a list of 10 to 20 colleges based on personal criteria.  Step 2
involves analyzing and evaluating information. Students should be attuned
to their needs and be creative researchers. By the middle of 12th grade,
the student should be able to narrow his or her list to five or six colleges,
taking into consideration (a) personal values, interests, and needs; (b) the
variety and range of available college opportunities; (c) realistic constraints
such as cost and distance; and (d) the method used by the colleges to select
a freshman class (selectivity factor).  The final list should include a safety
school (one that will definitely accept the student), a long shot (admissions
criteria are slightly beyond the student's credentials), and three or four
colleges having admissions criteria that match the student's credentials.</P>

<P>        Some gifted students are drawn to the most selective colleges and
universities, schools that receive more than 10 applications for every
freshman vacancy.  A student who aspires to a highly selective college can
expect a highly competitive application review. Students should
understand that the way they address the application process may be the
critical factor determining acceptance or rejection.</P>

<P>        The application requires the following two kinds of information:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
        	<LI>      Objective information including biographical data,
information
	on academic performance, standardized test scores such as SATs or ACTs,

Achievement Test scores, advanced placement (AP) examination grades,
and additional numerical information.
        <LI>      Subjective information including extracurricular activities,
recommendations, essay and/or personal statement, and a personal
interview.

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Colleges Look For</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>       <B>Academic performance:</B>  Grade point average and class rank.
	<LI>       <B>Academic rigor:</B>  Evidence of superior ability in the
form of honors,

GT, or AP courses.  (Some colleges ignore honors or GT classes because they
are of unknown quality.)
        Depth of study in areas such as foreign languages and mathematics.
      <LI>    <B>Quality:</B> Four or five academic subjects each year
(English,
mathematics, science, history, language).
     <LI>     <B>Balance:</B> Evidence that the student took a broad curriculum
(mathematics and science, history, and English courses)
     <LI>     <B>Trends:</B>  Evidence as to whether the student's grades
are gradually
improving each year. Recent performance is the most important indicator
of the student's current level of ability and motivation.
<LI>        <B>Consistency:</B>  The parts of the application should fit
together to
provide a common theme and make the student "come alive" on paper.
Recommendations should support and be consistent with both the
academic record and what the student says about himself or herself.  A
quirk in the transcript (e.g., a low grade in an academic course during 11th
or 12th grade) should be accompanied by an explanation. High SAT scores
combined with a relatively low GPA provide an inconsistent picture of an
applicant (e.g., high ability/low motivation).  The student should address
these situations in an essay or personal statement.
<LI>        <B>Standardized tests:</B>  PSATs, SATs, ACTs, and Achievement
Tests are
the only objective way a college can compare students from all parts of the
country.  Some large universities screen a vast number of applicants by
combining each student's SAT or ACT score with GPA and class rank.
Students who are not good test takers should avoid such colleges or make
sure that their scores are not so low that they can be eliminated from
consideration.  Selective schools may emphasize achievement test scores. If
students wait until senior year, only three tests may be taken.
<LI>       <B>Extracurricular activities and other supporting material:</B>
When
highly selective colleges decide between two students who are
academically equal, the creative presentation of extracurricular activities,
the quality of recommendations, the essay or personal statement, the
interview, and other supporting material make a difference.
<LI>       <B>Community service:</B>  Admissions officers know that an
altruistic
student, one who contributes to community life without regard for
compensation, is likely to contribute to college life, be academically
successful, and form a long-term attachment to the college or university.
<LI>        <B>Recommendations:</B>  Counselor and teacher recommendations
should
present a positive picture of the applicant, distinguish between the
applicant and others who are equally qualified, and be consistent with the
rest of the student's application.
<LI>        <B>The application essay:</B>  The essay can reassure the
admissions
committee that the student is capable of college-level work. Many gifted
students have a difficult time with open-ended questions.  Some create
beautiful prose that, on the surface, is convincing.  A closer look may
reveal that none of the ideas are documented, grounded in fact, or based
on any genuine information.
</UL>
<P>        A counselor's role as student advocate and resource does not end
when letters of acceptance arrive. Some students have difficulty breaking
away. These students spend years in academic and social activities that
nurture close friendships, and they sense that their lives are about to
change. Although this is true for adolescents in general, gifted students
may especially need guidance activities that ease the transition from high
school to college.</P>

<P>        College and career planning may be particularly difficult for some
gifted students. However, it can be a growth-promoting experience for all
participants when the ultimate goal--student decisions based on realistic
criteria that result in a satisfying life--is kept at the forefront of all
decision-making activity.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
voted today (CPSC)(2-1) (with Commissioners Mary Sheila Gall
and Thomas Moore in the majority and Chairman Ann Brown
dissenting) to amend the current children's sleepwear
standard under the Flammable Fabrics Act.  </P>
<P>     The amendments will permit the sale of tight-fitting
children's sleepwear and sleepwear for infants aged nine
months or under, even if the garments do not meet the
flammability standards ordinarily applicable to such
sleepwear. The new amendments will become effective 18
months after the date that they are published in the Federal
Register and the existing stay of enforcement will remain in
effect until that date.</P>
<P>     In commenting on the amendments, Commissioner Moore
said, "As a data-driven agency, we sometimes find that our
data support the relaxation of a consumer protection
regulation without compromising the safety of consumers.
Over the years the CPSC has taken a number of initiatives
that have reduced potential ignition sources in the home.
Those other actions contributed to our ability today to
allow consumers a limited cotton option for children's
sleepwear garments."  </P>
<P>     Commissioner Gall said, "As a commissioner and a
mother, I hope parents will wisely choose the safer
alternative of tight-fitting cotton sleepwear garments made
possible by these amendments, rather than loose-fitting
T-shirts."</P>
<P>     The commission reached its result based on staff
findings that there were virtually no injuries associated
with single-point ignition incidents of tight-fitting
sleepwear, or of sleepwear worn by infants under one year.
The data demonstrating this absence of injury were
buttressed by staff findings that: (1) tight-fitting
sleepwear is less likely to come into contact with a flame;
(2) even when ignited, tight-fitting sleepwear is not apt to
burn readily because it does not trap air that feeds a fire
and the proximity of the skin soaks up heat that would
otherwise cause the fire to spread; and (3) infants under
six months are insufficiently mobile to expose themselves to
sources of fire. </P>
<P>      CPSC used nine months instead of six as the sizing
criteria for infants' sleepwear
because of sizing practices within the clothing industry.
The commission hopes that its action
will enable consumers who prefer cotton sleepwear to choose
safer tight-fitting garments
rather than loose-fitting non-flame retardant clothing, such
as oversize T-shirts.</P>

<P>     I voted to amend the regulations pertaining to the
flammability of children's sleepwear. The record
conclusively demonstrates that the type of sleepwear that
will be permitted for sale by the amended regulations does
not pose an unreasonable risk of the occurrence of fire
leading to the death or injury of children.  The record
compiled by the staff demonstrates that for many years there
have been no injuries, either in the United States or
Canada, associated with the single point ignition of the
type of children's sleepwear that this amended standard
will permit to be sold.  There are verifiable reasons why
sleepwear permitted by this amended regulation
(tight-fitting cotton garments) is not likely to result in
death or injury from single point ignition fires.  Its fit
close to the body gives it three fire-resistant features:
(1) it is less likely to come into contact with an ignition
source;  (2) less air is available to feed the fire
even if the cloth is ignited;  and (3) the close proximity
of the skin acts as a "heat sink" to retard the spread of
fire.  </P>
<P>     The amended regulation that the Commission adopts today
is very similar to the one set forth in the staff proposal.
There is a slight change;  the new regulation exempts infant
sleepwear garments from the sleepwear flammability
requirements if they contain a label stating that they are
intended for use by infants under nine months.  The staff
recommendation specified six months.  Information that the
Commission received about sizing practices in the infants
clothing industry persuaded me that so many six-month old
children are wearing garments "sized at" nine months that
this change will result in no reduction of safety.</P>
<P>     The Commission received many sincere comments urging us
not to exempt any children's sleepwear garments at all from
the present sleepwear flammability standards. Although I
understand the motives of these commenters, I am convinced
that the amendments that we adopt today will lead to safer
choices for consumers than the loose-fitting non-flame
retardant garments that many consumers now use as children's
sleepwear.  I urge parents to select children's sleepwear
carefully with an eye towards flammability considerations,
and I urge all members of the apparel industry to join with
those members that have agreed to conduct an information and
education campaign to educate consumers about the relative
flammability hazards posed by various sleepwear garments.</P>

             <H4>Statement of Commissioner Thomas Hill Moore<BR>
           On the Children's Sleepwear Flammability Standard<BR><BR>
                         April 30, 1996<BR></H4>
 </center>
<P>     This has been the toughest decision I have had to make
since coming to the Commission. For me, there is no perfect
solution to the dilemma with which we are faced. There is
reason to believe that increasingly consumers are
circumventing the intent of the sleepwear regulation by
allowing their children to sleep in cotton non-sleepwear
garments, and yet there is no data to indicate the cotton
garments allowed under our stay of enforcement have resulted
in fire deaths or injuries.</P>
<P>     Even so, we still have questions about the sufficiency
and/or meaning of the no-injury data and, therefore,
questions of certainty as to what will be the impact of
further sanctioning  a limited cotton option in the
sleepwear market and thus changing a regulation many feel
has served the nation well for 20 years.  </P>
<P>    If it were legally supportable under the Administrative
Procedure Act and our own statutes, I would have preferred
to keep a string on this amendment to the sleepwear standard
by letting it go into effect for a set number of years and,
toward the end of that time, reviewing the results to see
how those injury statistics compared with the staff's
current projections of what they would be. If, at that time,
the data portended that increased use of cotton sleepwear
garments would have meant significantly increased fire
injury risks to children, the amendment would have been
automatically revoked. There does not seem to be a way to
achieve this without having to go through a full-blown
rulemaking proceeding at the end of the review period.</P>
<P>     The critical issue is, if you cannot control a family's
use of non-complying, cotton products as sleepwear, what is
the best solution for protecting child safety under these
circumstances? I am offering the next best solution. I voted
today to amend the sleepwear standard to allow tight-fitting
garments (as defined in the staff proposal) in sizes larger
than nine months to be made from cotton.  These garments
would still be subject to the flammability requirements of
the general wearing apparel standard but would no longer be
subject to the more stringent sleepwear standard.  </P>
<P>     I also voted to alter the staff proposal to allow
infants' garments sized nine months and smaller to be made
from cotton, without having to meet the tight-fitting
requirements, provided they are clearly labeled to indicate
that the size is nine months or smaller.  This will exclude
sleepwear for infants who are not very mobile and, therefore
not likely to put themselves in the way of an ignition
source, as consumers tend to buy larger sizes for rapidly
growing infants and, most likely, infants wearing  size nine
would be six months or younger.   Our data indicates that
children of this age (indeed, even children up to the age of
one year old) are not the victims of sleepwear ignition
injuries or death.  </P>
<P>     My vote was predicated on certain conditions. The
preamble to this rule must make it clear--and I want to
underscore this point--that the Commission will continue to
carefully and thoroughly monitor the injury statistics
related to sleepwear ignition and if, at any time, we see a
notable resurgence in fire injury risks related to infants'
or children's cotton sleepwear, we will act quickly
to commence a rulemaking to review the advisability of
continuing to allow these garments in the marketplace. And I
have asked the staff to provide this data to the
Commissioners on a frequent, periodic basis so we can watch
this situation very carefully. Also, it is worth reiterating
that if the Commission were to see a particular garment that
is clearly linked with increased fire injuries, the
Commission can and will take appropriate action against that
product.  </P>
<P>     If problems do develop, I want to make sure the
Commission learns of them promptly. To this end, I invite
medical and fire fighting professionals to help us compile
the most accurate data possible about this type of
fire-related hazard. The Commission has received a number of
letters from both types of professionals opposing any change
to the sleepwear standard. Many of the comments were based
on a fear of what might happen, coupled with the knowledge
of how devastating burn injuries can be, rather than on any
concrete data about deaths or injuries from the cotton
underwear and playwear garments which are currently being
used as sleepwear.   </P>
<P>     Based on the scientific information and fire data
presently available, we expect to continue to see a lack of
fire injuries and deaths if tight-fitting cotton sleepwear
is allowed in the market and is used properly.  But I
encourage those most concerned about this regulation from
its safety perspective to be vigilant in helping to monitor
this situation.  I also want them to be reassured that our
action today does not mean that we will fail to follow very
carefully the impact this relaxation in the standard
has on the safety of our nation's children.</P>
<P>     Despite the current sleepwear regulations, we know that
some parents either specifically seek out non-sleepwear
cotton garments for their children to sleep in or allow
their children to sleep in their cotton underwear/daywear
although they may not have originally purchased the garments
for that purpose.  The increase in long underwear sales
since our stay of enforcement is some evidence of this use.
Both the experience under the stay, and to some extent, the
lack of a problem under the more liberal Canadian standard,
lead to the conclusion that we can also relax our standard
without harm.  </P>
<P>     Given the fact the American consumer is already
experimenting in this area and doing it blindly, it behooves
the Commission to at least try to control this situation by
allowing a tight-fitting cotton sleepwear garment on the
market and by giving consumers the information they need to
make an informed choice.</P>
<P>     I believe, with certain safeguards, we can give parents
a limited cotton option, which they seem to want.  However,
I also believe it is critical to remind parents why the
infants' and children's sleepwear standard was promulgated
in the first place.  Some manufacturers I spoke with during
this deliberative process confirmed my own suspicions--
people do not know why they cannot obtain cotton sleepwear
for their children.  The origins of the regulation have
passed from the memory of an older generation and have not
been transmitted to the next.  If parents are to be given a
choice, they need to have the information on which to base
their decision.  </P>
<P>     Certain industry groups, such as the National Cotton
Council and the American Apparel Association, as well as
individual companies, such as Carter's, have given
assurances they will mount an information and education
campaign, with CPSC guidance, which I hope will help
consumers to understand why the cotton sleepwear garments
that are being allowed on the market must fit their children
snugly; why certain types of sleepwear garments will remain
polyester; and, why loose fitting cotton garments should not
be used as sleepwear.  </P>
<P>     I believe it is imperative that a visible point of
purchase label of some type either be on the garment or on
or inside the garment wrapper.  As necessary as information
and education campaigns are, unless they extend across
generations (and neither industry nor the CPSC has that kind
of money), they have a limited life, and once over with,
people will rapidly forget--just as current parents
have--the reason for the limited cotton sleepwear options.
A proper label will continually remind consumers of
the purpose of the regulations.</P>
<P>     In conjunction with reminding the public about the
purpose of the sleepwear regulations, the information and
education campaign should educate retailers as to why it is
important to separate complying sleepwear from noncomplying
underwear and daywear that could be used for sleepwear.  A
commingling of those products dilutes the message we are
trying to send to consumers and makes it more likely that
even the most educated consumer will inadvertently buy a
product other than the one they originally intended to buy:
buying instead a non-sleepwear alternative that is not as
tight-fitting and, therefore not as safe for sleeping, as a
similar complying sleepwear garment.</P>
<P>     In addition, I am encouraged that, at least in the
short-term, a well-designed and broadly disseminated
information and education campaign will assist the
Commission in addressing a problem we uncovered as part of
our review of the fire death and injury statistics, and that
is the problem of children sleeping in loose fitting
non-sleepwear garments, typically t-shirts.  Tragically,
this is where the deaths and injuries are occurring.</P>
<P>     Residential fire deaths and injuries have declined
dramatically over the last twenty years.  And deaths and
injuries from all types of clothing ignition (not just the
sleepwear that is the subject of this rulemaking) have gone
way down.  Since its inception, the Commission has attacked
the nation's fire problem, as it relates to consumer
products, on a number of fronts, including making products
such as portable electric and kerosene heaters safer and
requiring disposable cigarette lighters to be
child-resistant.  Thus, many of the ignition sources that
led to the promulgation of the sleepwear standard have been
significantly reduced.  Other groups, often in conjunction
with the Commission, have attacked the problem from an
educational perspective. And certain societal changes, such
as a decline in the number of adults who smoke, have also
contributed to the decline in residential fires.  </P>
<P>     The continued need for the infants' and children's
sleepwear standard, as originally conceived, is thus hard to
quantify.  I believe the standard has played a role, and, I
also believe that the standard, as we propose to amend it,
along with a strong consumer information and education
program, will continue to play a role in reducing injuries
and deaths to our children from sleepwear ignitions.</P>

<center><H4>Statement of Chairman Ann Brown<BR>
   Children's Sleepwear<BR><BR>
             April 30, 1996<BR>
</H4></center>
<P>     For nearly 25 years, America's children have been
protected from the risk of fire from their sleepwear.Their
parents have been secure in the knowledge that their
children's sleepwear was flame resistant. The CPSC's
flammability standards for children's sleepwear have worked
to protect America's children. But today, I fear that action
is being taken that may result in a reduction of the level
of safety afforded our children and grandchildren. Based on
the record before the Commission, I cannot join with my
fellow Commissioners in amending the children's sleepwear
standards by exempting tight-fitting garments and exempting
completely garments under size 9 months.  </P>
<P>     In deciding whether to amend the children's sleepwear
flammability standards, my primary concern has been and will
continue to be the safety of children. According to the
staff, exempting tight-fitting 100% cotton sleepwear from
the children's sleepwear flammability standards, and
exempting infants' garments regardless of whether they are
tight-fitting, should not reduce the level of safety
afforded by the existing standards. I believe this is
speculative. </P>
<P>     Available injury and death data demonstrate to me that
the sleepwear standards are working. There have been very
few injuries or deaths involving the ignition of children's
sleepwear in recent years. I attribute this low level of
injury and death primarily to the sleepwear standards.  </P>
<P>     I agree with the staff's conclusion that tight-fitting
cotton garments present less of a hazard than loose-fitting
cotton garments. But garments that comply with the existing
sleepwear standards provide the best protection. There
simply is no factual basis to conclude that by amending the
sleepwear standards to allow the use of 100% cotton
garments, parents will switch from loose-fitting cotton
garments (e.g. t-shirts) to exempt tight-fitting sleepwear.
There is no evidence of consumer demand for tight-fitting
sleepwear. Indeed, it is just as likely consumers will
purchase tight-fitting garments in larger sizes to increase
comfort, and to allow a child to grow into the garment,
thereby obviating any possible safety benefit staff has
indicated might be achieved with tight-fitting garments.  </P>
<P>     Further, I am concerned that any purchase of
tight-fitting garments will be at the expense of garments
that meet the children's sleepwear flammability standards.
If so, the level of safety afforded children may well be
reduced.  </P>
<P>     I am also concerned that there will be a significantly
decreased market for flame-resistant garments, and that,
except for girls'nightgowns, flame-resistant garments could
disappear from the market. Finally, rather than amending the
standards with the understanding that the amendments could
be revisited if injuries or deaths occur, we should rely on
the existing standards to continue protecting our
children.</P>
<P>     I am particularly concerned with the vote to exempt
from the flammability standards completely, garments under
size 9 months. As any parent knows, children under 9 months
of age often are mobile and can come in contact with
ignition sources. In 1978, the Commission also considered
whether to exempt from the flammability standards garments
for young children, at that time it was garments under size
1 (generally worn by children under 12 months of age). At
that time, the Commission reviewed 10 cases involving
sleepwear garments. 43 Fed. Reg. 31,348 (July 21, 1978).
Four of the infants in these 10 sleepwear cases were
protected by their garments from more serious burn injuries.
Two of these garments were reported to be flame resistant,
and one other was thought to be flame resistant.  The four
victims sustained burn injuries only to the exposed areas of
the body, and all four survived.  In five other cases, the
garments ignited contributing to or causing the burn injury.
All five victims sustained severe burns. Id. Based on this
information, the Commission rejected exempting garments
under size 1. This same information leads me to conclude not
to vote to amend the sleepwear standards to exempt garments
under size 9 months.  </P>
<P>     I recognize that there may be a consumer preference for
cotton garments. I understand and am sympathetic to this
preference.  But, it is the Commission's responsibility
under the Flammable Fabrics Act to protect the public
against the unreasonable risk of fire leading to death,
injury or significant property damage. Based on the existing
record, I conclude that the potentially higher risk of
injury to infants and children from burns exceeds the
possible benefits of 100 percent untreated cotton garments.  </P>
<P>     I do support the need to educate parents, new parents
in particular, of the flammability danger presented by
loose, flowing garments worn by children near sources of
ignition. At least one major trade association and one major
children's clothing manufacturer has indicated a willingness
to join with the Commission in an education campaign to warn
consumers of the flammability risk of loose, flowing
garments. I urge them to do so.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
is alerting consumers and public health officials to steps they can take
to reduce entrapment deaths and injuries associated with pools, spas,
and hot tubs.</P>

<P>     The main hazard from hot tubs and spas is the same as that from pools -
drowning.  Since 1980, CPSC has reports of more than 700 deaths in spas
and hot tubs. About one-third of those were drownings to children under
age five.</P>

<P>     Other hazards include body part entrapment and hair entanglement.</P>

<P>     Since 1980, CPSC knows of 18 incidents, including five deaths,
involving children between the ages of two and 14 who were injured or
died due to body part entrapment involving the drain of a swimming pool,
wading pool, or spa. In addition, last week, a 16-year-old New Jersey
girl drowned when her body was sucked down against a drain on the
bottom of a spa. Her body apparently formed a vacuum seal against
an outlet for circulating water and she was held underwater.</P>

<P>     Under normal conditions, pipes leading from a pool's drain, or into
the pool's pumps, draw water from the pool creating suction. If something 
blocks the pool drain leading into this pipe, the amount of suction will
increase as the pump draws water past the obstruction.  This increased
suction can entrap parts of a person's body, causing the person to be held
underwater. In wading pools, if a child sits on the drain outlet, the
suction can cause disembowelment.</P>

<P>     To reduce the risk of entrapment and drowning, current safety standards
require that each spa have two outlets for each pump, lessening the amount 
of suction at any single outlet.</P>

<P>     Since 1978, CPSC has reports of 49 incidents (including 13 deaths) in 
which people's hair was sucked into the suction fitting of a spa, hot tub, 
or whirlpool, causing the victim's head to be held under water. Hair
entanglement occurs when a bather's hair becomes entangled in a drain
cover as the water and hair are drawn through the drain. CPSC helped
develop a voluntary standard for drain covers that reduce the risk of hair 
entanglement.</P>

<P>     CPSC offers the following safety tips when using a hot tub, spa, or
whirlpool:</P>

<ul>
<li>Always use a locked safety cover when the spa is not in use and keep young
  children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult
  supervision.

<br><br><li>Make sure the spa has the dual drains and drain covers required by current
  safety standards.

<br><br><li>Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it 
is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place
  and not cracked or missing. Check the drain covers yourself throughout
  the year.

<br><br><li>Know where the cut-off switch for your pump is so you can turn it off in an emergency.

<br><br><li>Be aware that consuming alcohol while using a spa could lead to drowning.

<br><br><li>Keep the temperature of the water in the spa at 104 degrees Fahrenheit
  or below.<BR><BR>
  </ul>

<P>Washington, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Bucky Products Inc., of
Seattle, Wash., is recalling over 3,800 Baby Bucky baby
pillows. Infant pillows and cushions have been banned under
the Federal Hazardous Substances Act because they pose a
potential suffocation hazard to infants.</P>
<P>     The C-shaped infant pillows are intended for use in
infant car seats and strollers to keep children's heads from
rolling from side to side as they sleep. The pillows,
measuring 10 inches long by 9.5 inches wide, weigh about 10
ounces, are covered in French blue, pink, or emerald jade
Polartec fabric, and are filled with buckwheat hulls. The
pillows' hang tags read in part, "baby BUCKY ... Seattle
U.S.A. ... Pillows." Travel, variety, drug, and department
retail stores sold the pillows nationwide from December 1993
to June 1995 for $22 each.</P>
<P>     Consumers should take the pillows away from children
immediately and return the pillows to the store where
purchased for a full refund. Consumers can also send their
Baby Bucky pillows to P.O. Box 31970, Seattle, Wash. 98103
for a full refund plus mailing costs.  For more information,
consumers should call Bucky Products Inc. at (800) 692-8259.</P>

<P>     Bucky Products Inc. and CPSC are not aware of any
injuries involving these pillows.  This recall does not include
 the larger Adult Bucky Travel Pillows. </P>

<P>American children must be ready to learn from the first day of school.  And of course, preparing children for school is a historic responsibility of parents.</P>

<P>Should you help your child with writing?</P>

<P>Yes, if you want your child to:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> Do well in school
	<LI> Enjoy self-expression
	<LI> Become more self-reliant
</UL>

<P>You know how important writing will be to your child's life.  It
will be important from first-grade through college and throughout
adulthood.</P>

<P>Writing is:</P>

<P><B>Practical.</B>  Most of us make lists, jot down reminders, and write
notes and instructions at least occasionally.</P>

<P><B>Job-Related.</B>  Professional and white-collar workers write
frequently--preparing memos, letters, briefing papers, sales
reports, articles, research reports, proposals, and the like.
Most workers do "some" writing on the job.</P>

<P><B>Stimulating.</B>  Writing helps to provoke thoughts and to organize
them logically and concisely.</P>

<P><B>Social.</B>  Most of us write thank-you notes and letters to friends
at least now and then.</P>

<P><B>Therapeutic.</B>  It can be helpful to express feelings in writing
that cannot be expressed so easily by speaking.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, "many schools are unable to give children sufficient
instruction in writing."  There are various reasons:  teachers
aren't trained to teach writing skills, writing classes may be too
large, it's often difficult to measure writing skills, etc.</P>

<P>Study after study shows that students' writing lacks clarity,
coherence, and organization.  Only a few students can write
persuasive essays or competent business letters.  As many as one
out of four have serious writing difficulties.  And students say
they like writing less and less as they go through school.</P>

<P>That's why the Office of Educational Research and Improvement
(OERI) suggests that you help your child with writing.  OERI
believes you, a parent, can make a big difference.  You can use
helping strategies that are simple and fun.  You can use them to
help your child learn to write well--and to enjoy doing it!  This
leaflet tells you how.</P>

<a name="Things"></a>
<H3>Things to Know
</H3>
<P>Writing is more than putting words on paper.  It's a final stage
in the complex process of communicating that begins with
"thinking."  Writing is an especially important stage in
communication, the intent being to leave no room for doubt.  Has any
country ratified a verbal treaty?</P>

<P>One of the first means of communication for your child is through
drawing.  Do encourage the child to draw and to discuss his/her
drawings.  Ask questions:  What is the boy doing?  Does the house
look like ours?  Can you tell a story about this picture?</P>

<P>Most children's basic speech patterns are formed by the time they
enter school.  By that time children speak clearly, recognize most
letters of the alphabet, and may try to write.  Show an interest
in, and ask questions about, the things your child says, draws,
and may try to write.</P>

<P>Writing well requires:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>  CLEAR THINKING.  Sometimes the child needs to have his/her
     	memory refreshed about a past event in order to write about
     	it.<BR><BR>


<LI>   SUFFICIENT TIME.  Children may have `stories in their heads'
     but need time to think them through and write them down.
     School class periods are often not long enough.<BR><BR>

<LI>   READING.  Reading can stimulate a child to write about
     his/her own family or school life.  If your child reads good
     books, (s)he will be a better writer.<BR><BR>

<LI>    A MEANINGFUL TASK.  A child needs meaningful, not artificial
     writing tasks.  You'll find suggestions for such tasks in the
     section, "Things To Do."<BR><BR>

<LI>    INTEREST.  All the time in the world won't help if there is
     nothing to write, nothing to say.  Some of the reasons for
     writing include: sending messages, keeping records,
     expressing feelings, or relaying information.<BR><BR>

<LI>   PRACTICE.  And more practice.<BR><BR>

<LI>   REVISING.  Students need experience in revising their work--
     i.e, seeing what they can do to make it clearer, more
     descriptive, more concise, etc.<BR><BR>

<a name="Pointers"></a>
<H3>Pointers For Parents
</H3>
<P>In helping your child to learn to write well, remember that your
goal is to make writing easier and more enjoyable.</P>

<P><B>Provide A Place.</B>  It's important for a child to have a good place
to write--a desk or table with a smooth, flat surface and good
lighting.</P>

<P><B>Have the Materials. </B> Provide plenty of paper--lined and unlined--and
things to write with, including pencils, pens, and crayons.</P>

<P><B>Allow Time.</B>  Help your child spend time thinking about a writing
project or exercise.  Good writers do a great deal of thinking.
Your child may dawdle, sharpen a pencil, get papers ready, or look
up the spelling of a word.  Be patient--your child may be thinking.</P>

<P><B>Respond. </B> Do respond to the ideas your child expresses verbally or
in writing.  Make it clear that you are interested in the true
function of writing which is to convey ideas.  This means focusing
on "what" the child has written, not "how" it was written.  It's
usually wise to ignore minor errors, particularly at the stage
when your child is just getting ideas together.</P>

<P><B>Don't You Write It!</B>  Don't write a paper for your child that will
be turned in as his/her work.  Never rewrite a child's work.
Meeting a writing deadline, taking responsibility for the finished
product, and feeling ownership of it are important parts of
writing well.</P>

<P><B>Praise.  </B>Take a positive approach and say something good about
your child's writing.  Is it accurate?  Descriptive?  Thoughtful?
Interesting?  Does it say something?</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Do"></a>
<H3>Things To Do</H3>

<P><B>Make It Real.</B>  Your child needs to do real writing. It's more
important for the child to write a letter to a relative than it is
to write a one-line note on a greeting card.  Encourage the child
to write to relatives and friends.  Perhaps your child would enjoy
corresponding with a pen pal.</P>

<P><B>Suggest Note-Taking.</B>  Encourage your child to take notes on trips
or outings and to describe what (s)he saw.  This could include a
description of nature walks, a boat ride, a car trip, or other
events that lend themselves to note-taking.</P>

<P><B>Brainstorm. </B> Talk with your child as much as possible about
his/her impressions and encourage the child to describe people and
events to you.  If the child's description is especially accurate
and colorful, say so.</P>

<P><B>Encourage Keeping A Journal.</B>  This is excellent writing practice
as well as a good outlet for venting feelings.  Encourage your
child to write about things that happen at home and school, about
people (s)he likes or dislikes and why, things to remember or
things the child wants to do.  Especially encourage your child to
write about personal feelings--pleasures as well as
disappointments.  If the child wants to share the journal with
you, read the entries and discuss them--especially the child's
ideas and perceptions.</P>

<P><B>Write Together.</B>  Have your child help you with letters, even such
routine ones as ordering items from an advertisment or writing to
a business firm.  This helps the child to see firsthand that
writing is important to adults and truly useful.</P>

<P><B>Use Games.</B>  There are numerous games and puzzles that help a child
to increase vocabulary and make the child more fluent in speaking
and writing.  Remember, building a vocabulary builds confidence.
Try crossword puzzles, word games, anagrams and cryptograms de-
signed especially for children.  Flash cards are good, too, and
they're easy to make at home.</P>

<P><B>Suggest Making Lists.</B>  Most children like to make lists just as
they like to count.  Encourage this.  Making lists is good
practice and helps a child to become more organized.  Boys and
girls might make lists of their records, tapes, baseball cards,
dolls, furniture in a room, etc.  They could include items they
want.  It's also good practice to make lists of things to do,
schoolwork, dates for tests, social events, and other reminders.</P>

<P><B>Encourage Copying. </B> If a child likes a particular song, suggest
learning the words by writing them down--replaying the song on your
stereo/tape player or jotting down the words whenever the song is
played on a radio program.  Also encourage copying favorite poems
or quotations from books and plays.</P>

<P>     In some of the nation's sunbelt, drowning has been the
leading cause of accidental death in the home of children under 5
years old. The information below can help parents and caregivers
provide young children with the protection they deserve. </P>

<P>     Each year, nationwide, more than 300 children under 5 years
old drown in residential swimming pools, usually a pool owned by
their family. In addition, more than 2,000 children in that age
group are treated in hospital emergency rooms for submersion
injures. </P>

<P>     Medical costs for submersion victims during the initial
hospitalization alone can be quite high. Costs can range from an
estimated $2,000 for a victim who recovers fully to $80,000 for a
victim with severe brain damage. Some severely brain damaged
victims have initial hospital stays in excess of 120 days and
expenses in excess of $150,000. </P>

<P>     Many communities have enacted safety regulations governing
residential swimming pools -- inground and aboveground. It's up
to parents to comply with these regulations. Apart from these
laws, parents who own pools, can take their own precautions to
reduce the chances of their youngsters accessing the family pool
or spa without adult supervision.</P>

<a name="Facts"></a>
<H3>Facts and Figures</H3>

<P>     Following are just a few facts uncovered by the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in a comprehensive
study of drowning and submersion incidents involving children
under 5 years old in Arizona, California, and Florida. </P>

<UL>
<LI>    Seventy-five percent of the submersion victims studied by
CPSC were between I and 3 years old; 65 percent of this group
were boys. Toddlers, in particular, often do something unexpected
because their capabilities change daily. 

<LI>    At the time of the incidents, most victims were being
supervised by one or both parents.  Forty-six percent of the
victims were last seen in the house; 23 percent were last seen in
the yard or on the porch or patio; and 31 percent were in or
around the pool before the accident. In all, 69 percent of the
children were not expected to be at or in the pool, yet they were
found in the water. 

<LI>   Submersion incidents involving children usually happen in
familiar surroundings. Sixty-five percent of the incidents
happened in a pool owned by the child's family and 33 percent o
the incidents happened in a pool owned by friends or relatives. 

<LI>    Pool submersions involving children happen quickly. A child
can drown in the time it takes to answer a phone. Seventy-seven
percent of the victims had been missing from sight for 5 minutes
or less. 

<LI>    Survival depends on rescuing the child quickly and
restarting the breathing process, even while the child is still
in the water. Seconds count in preventing death or brain damage. 

<LI>    Child drowning is a silent death. There's no splashing to
alert anyone that the child is in trouble.

<P>     The following barrier recommendations are the result of

<H3>Fences and Gates</H3>

<UL>
<LI>  Install a fence or other barrier, such as a wall, completely
around the pool. If the house is part of the barrier, the doors
leading from the house to the pool should be protected with an
alarm or the pool should have a power safety cover. Alarm and
cover details are below. 

<LI>    The fence or other barrier should be at least 4 feet high.
It should have no foot- or handholds that could help a young
child to climb it. 

<LI>    Vertical fence slats should be less than 4 inches apart to
prevent a child from squeezing through.  


<LI>Use this as a guide when the release mechanism is located less
than 54 inches from the bottom of the gate.

<UL>
<LI>    If horizontal members are equal to or more than 45 inches
apart, vertical spacing shall not exceed 4 inches. 

<LI>    If the fence is chain link, then no part of the
diamond-shaped opening should be larger than 1-3/4 inches. 
</UL>

<LI>    Fence gates should be self-closing and self-latching. The
gate should be well maintained to close and latch easily. The
latch should be out of a child's reach. 

<LI>    When the release mechanism of the self-latching device is
less than 54 inches from the bottom of the gate, the release
mechanism for the gate should be at least 3 inches below the top
of the gate on the side facing the pool. Placing the release
mechanism at this height prevents a young child from reaching
over the top of a gate and releasing the latch. Also, the gate
and barrier should have no opening greater than 1/2 inch within
18 inches of the latch release mechanism. This prevents a young
child from reaching through the gate and releasing the latch.
</UL>

<P>     There are a wide variety of fencing construction materials
available to compliment your house and pool surroundings. Your
local fence company or pool enclosure company can provide you
with information and assist you in making a selection.</P>

<P>     The weak link in the strongest and highest fence is a gate
that fails to close and latch completely. For a gate to close
completely every time, it must be in proper working order.</P>

<a name="Door"></a>
<H3>Door Alarms</H3>

<UL>
<LI>    If the house forms one side of the barrier, then doors
leading from the house to the pool should be protected with
alarms that produce an audible sound when a door is unexpectedly
opened. 

<LI>    Install an alarm that can be temporarily turned off by an
adult for a single opening of the door by using a keypad or
switch that is out of a child's reach.
</UL>

<P>     Battery and electrically powered alarms are available. The
key pad switch can be used by adults who wish to pass through the
door without setting off the alarm. It should be placed high on
all doors leading from the house to the pool. Affordable and
easily installed alarms are available. An alarm signal
immediately tells a parent that a door has been opened. </P>

<hr>

<a name="Power"></a>
<H3>Power Safety Covers</H3>

<UL>
<LI>    Power safety covers over the pool may be used as an
alternative to door alarms. A power safety cover should meet the
requirements of the ASTM pool cover standard which addresses
labeling requirements and performance. ASTM requires that a cover
withstand the weight of two adults and a child to allow a rescue
should an individual fall onto the cover. The standard also 
requires quick removal of water from the cover. A young child can
drown in just inches of water. 
</UL>

<P>     A power safety cover is a motor powered barrier that can be
placed over the water area. Motor-driven covers easily open and
close over the pool. When the power safety cover is properly in
place over the pool, it provides a high level of safety for
children under 5 years old by inhibiting their access to the
water. </P>

<H3>Above-Ground Pools</H3>

<UL>
<LI>    Steps and ladders leading from the ground to the pool should
be secured and locked, or removed when the pool is not in use.
</UL>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Rules"></a>
<H3>Rules For Pools</H3>

<UL>
<LI>      Instruct baby sitters about potential pool hazards to young
children and about the use of protective devices, such as door
alarms and latches. Emphasize the need for constant supervision. 

<LI>      Never leave a child unsupervised near a pool. During social
gatherings at or near a pool, appoint a "designated watcher" to
protect young children from pool accidents. Adults may take turns
being the "watcher." When adults become preoccupied, children are
at risk. 

<LI>      If a child is missing, check the pool first. Seconds count
in preventing death or disability. Go to the edge of the pool and
scan the entire pool, bottom and surface, as well as the pool
area. 

<LI>     Do not allow a young child in the pool without an adult. 

<LI>      Do not consider young children to be drownproof because they
have had swimming lessons. Children must be watched closely while
swimming. 

<LI>      Do not use flotation devices as a substitute for
supervision. 

<LI>      Learn CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Baby sitters and
other caretakers, such as grandparents and older siblings, should
also know CPR. 

<LI>      Keep rescue equipment by the pool. Be sure a telephone is
poolside with emergency numbers posted nearby. 

<LI>      Remove toys from in and around the pool when it is not in
use. Toys can attract young children to the pool. 

<LI>      Never prop open the gate to a pool barrier.

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. --  In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission(CPSC), Dutton Children's Books, a
division of Penguin USA of New York, N.Y., is recalling
about 24,000 "Color 'N Contrast Crib Books." The books were sold
under two titles, "KITTY AND FRIENDS" and "PUPPY AND FRIENDS."
These books were sold under the Playskool name, which is licensed
by Dutton. Straight pins used during the manufacturing process
were mistakenly left in some of the books, creating a hazard to
young children.</P>
<P>     Neither CPSC nor Penguin USA is aware of any injuries
involving these books. This recall is being conducted to prevent
the possibility of injury.</P>
<P>     The "Kitty and Friends Color and Contrast   Crib Book" and
"Puppy and Friends Color and Contrast Crib Book" each consist of
five attached plush fabric panels. Each panel has a black and
white picture on one side and a color picture on the other. The
panels can be folded into one another, creating a "book." The
first and last panel have Velcro tabs attached so that the
unfolded panels can be attached to crib slats and used as a crib
decoration. The books measure 5.25 inches by 5.25 inches when
folded and 5.25 inches by 26 inches when extended.</P>
<P>     The "Kitty and Friends" book includes colored panels with
pictures of a house, a bear, a duck, a flower, and a locomotive.
The book's black and white panels include pictures of a
rocking horse, four boxes with a quarter moon, heart, triangle,
and star, a boy's face, a target, and a cat.</P>
<P>     The "Puppy and Friends" book includes colored panels with
pictures of a fish, a ball, a butterfly, a car, and an apple. The
book's black and white panels include pictures of a sail
boat, four boxes with two circular mazes and two square mazes, a
girl's face, a design with a triangle, a heart, a circle and a
star, and a dog.</P>
<P>        A label on the fabric flaps reads in part, "Dutton
Children's Books, a division of Penguin Books USA Inc. ...
Playskool ... Hasbro, Inc." and "ISBN 0-525-45468-3" or "ISBN
0-525-45469-1." (Playskool licenses its name to Penguin Books USA
Inc.)</P>
<P>        The books were packaged in a clear plastic bag with a
cardboard insert and a cardboard header. The cardboard header
reads in part, "PLAYSKOOL COLOR 'N'CONTRAST Crib Book."</P>
<P>        Various retail stores, including Barnes and Noble,
Borders, Walden Books, Crown Books, Fay's Drug Stores, Burlington
Coat Factory, Musicland, Baby Superstores, and others, sold the
books nationwide from November 1995 to March 1996 for $4.99 each.</P>
<P>        Consumers should take these books away from young
children immediately and return them to the retail store where
purchased for a full refund. Consumers can also mail the
books to Penguin USA, 100 Fabrite Road, Newbern, TN 38059-1334,
Attn: Cloth Book Department. Penguin USA will reimburse consumers
the price of the book and postage costs. For more information,
consumers should call Penguin USA at (800) 447-9911.  </P>
<P>        The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the
public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death from 15,000
types of consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction.  To
report a dangerous product or a product-related injury and for
information on CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline
at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270.  To

accidental poisonings. Follow this checklist to learn how to
correct situations that may lead to poisonings.  If you answer
"No" to any questions, fix the situation quickly.  Your goal is
to have all your answers "Yes."

<td>1.</td><td>   Did you ever stop to think that medicines
     could poison if used improperly?  Many
     children are poisoned each year by
     overdoses of aspirin.  If aspirin can
     poison, just think of how many other
     poisons might be in your medicine
     cabinet.             </td><td> ____ </td><td>
                  ____</td></tr><tr>

<td>2.</td><td>    Do your aspirins and other potentially
     harmful products have child-resistant
     closures?  Aspirins and most prescription
     drugs come with child-resistant caps.
     Check to see yours have them, and that
     they are properly secured.  Check your
     prescriptions before leaving the pharmacy
     to make sure the medicines are in child-
     resistant packaging.  These caps have
     been shown to save the lives of children.     </td><td> ____ </td><td>

<td>3.</td><td>    Have you thrown out all out-of-date
     prescriptions?  As medicines get older,
     the chemicals inside them can change.  So
     what was once a good medicine may now be
     a dangerous poison.  Flush all old drugs
     down the toilet.  Rinse the container
     well, then discard it.       </td><td> ____ </td><td>
                  ____</td></tr><tr>

<td>4.</td><td>    Are all medicines in their original
     containers with the original labels?
     Prescription medicines may or may not
     list ingredients.  The prescription
     number on the label will, however, allow
     rapid identification by the pharmacist of
     the ingredients should they not be
     listed.  Without the original label and
     container, you can't be sure of what
     you're taking.  After all, aspirin looks
     a lot like poisonous roach tablets.             </td><td> ____

<td>5.</td><td>   If your vitamins or vitamin/mineral
     supplements contain iron, are they in

     think of vitamins and minerals as foods
     and, therefore, nontoxic, but a few iron

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. -  In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Kmart Corporation, of
Troy, Mich., is voluntarily recalling 23,000 rompers for
infant girls. The paint on the rompers' buttons is dangerous
for young children because it contains an excessive level of
lead. Because of the excessive lead levels, the rompers
violate the Consumer Product Safety Act.</P>
     Kmart initiated the recall in response to a consumer's
concerns about paint chipping from the buttons after washing
the rompers. Kmart and CPSC are not aware of any injuries
involving the garments. This recall is being conducted to
prevent the possibility of injury. 

<P>     The short sleeve, crew-neck rompers, which come in
white with pink flowers or white with blue flowers, were
available in three sizes: 12 months, 18 months, and 24
months. Three shiny plastic buttons on the front of the
garments each measure approximately .5 inch in
diameter. Sewn-in tags in the neck of the rompers read in
part, "YOUNG CLASSICS (TM) 60% COTTON 40% POLYESTER RN #
42000 BANGLADESH." The style number 1832 appears on the
rompers' hang tags. </P>

<P>     Kmart stores sold the rompers nationwide for $6.99 from
January 1996 through April 1996 under the Young Classics
label in the Kidsworld department.</P>
<P>     Consumers should return the rompers to any Kmart store
for a full refund. For more information about this recall,
consumers should contact Kmart at their toll-free customer
service line at (800) 63KMART. Consumers can also contact
any Kmart store for more information.</P>
<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death
from 15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's
fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800)
638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To
order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301)
504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the
release number. Consumers can obtain this release
and recall information via Internet gopher services at
cpsc.gov or report product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</P>

<P>MINNEAPOLIS, May 13, 1996 -- Baby Gard, an advanced computerized skin contact thermometer, can now monitor temperatures without disturbing children while they sleep. Unlike conventional thermometers, Baby Gard instantly measures temperatures and alerts parents if temperatures reach pre-designated levels.</P>

<P>"Parents, health care professionals and consumers of all kinds will find Baby Gard to be a user-friendly thermometer that conveniently helps keep a continuous eye on a sick child," said Alan Webb, president of the Webb Company, which manufactures and distributes Baby Gard.</P>

<P>Baby Gard can memorize up to ten temperature readings and display them on demand, which is especially important when monitoring the effects of medication given to a child. Temperature readings can be stored during the night and read in the morning. Measurements are recorded automatically at 15, 30 or 60 minute intervals.</P>

<P>Baby Gard can be pre-set to monitor a child's temperature fluctuation. It alarms when pre-designated temperature has been reached. Using Baby Gard with a baby intercom alerts parents anywhere in the house.</P>

<P>All materials are FDA approved and produced to the highest safety standards. Baby Gard's temperature measuring range is from 95 - 109.4 degrees Fahrenheit.</P>

<P>Suggested retail price is $24.95 and is available by mail order by calling 800-999-9322 (WEBB). The Webb Company is a Minnesota-based corporation that manufactures and distributes security products.</P>

<P>CLEVELAND, May 9, 1996-- Cyberphysiologic techniques -- self-hypnosis, relaxation exercises, and other methods of self-regulation -- can help children control the frequency and pain of migraine headache episodes, according to researchers at Rainbow Babies and Childrens Hospital of University Hospitals of Cleveland, and Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. The data from the study will be presented at the 1996 Pediatric Academic Societies' Annual Meeting, Nay 6-10, in Washington, D.C.</P>

<P>"Our research determined that learning relaxation techniques and using imagery is more effective in eliminating juvenile migraine than prescribing preventive medication," says Dr. Karen Olness, director of the Pediatric Biobehavioral Center at Rainbow Babies and Childrens Hospital, and associate professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. "The children using these techniques experienced fewer headaches. And, for the first time in a controlled study, we've shown that the same type of mast cell activation that occurs in adult migraine is also present in children."  </P>

<P>Mast cells are responsible for releasing neutotransmitters in the brain that cause changes in the vascular and autonomic systems, and result in migraine symptoms. Scientists can determine mast cell activation by measuring an increased level of tryptase in urine. For example, some foods believed to trigger migraine symptoms are also associated with activated mast cells. In this new study, the use of cyberphysiologic techniques practiced by children over a six month period resulted in a reduction of tryptase.</P>

<P>The study involved 30 children, ages 5 to 12, who met the International Headache Society classification for juvenile migraines. The children avoided eating chocolate, bananas and cheese -- foods that can activate mast cells. During their first visit, the children were taught a progressive relaxation exercise, and how to focus on pleasant imagery. They were asked to practice these techniques twice a day for ten minutes. During a second visit, their ability to self-regulate was measured through biofeedback, galvanic skin response, and temperature recording. Children were offered several pain control methods, and asked to choose one to practice at home. On the third visit, these cyberphysiologic techniques were reviewed and the child was asked to practice once daily and to record practice times.</P>

<P>Researchers taught children how to use an imaginary control to "turn off" the pain of headaches when they occur. "We asked children to imagine a favorite place," says Dr. Olness. `'A place that you know about or can imagine. A place where you like where you are and how you feel. The more you can feel like you're in a place that you enjoy, the easier it is for you to tell your body to do things that are good for you and helpful to you."</P>

<P>Researchers tested urine samples over a six month period, collected before, during and after a migraine episode. After cyberphysiologic training, average urine tryptase levels decreased significantly in nine of eleven children who were successful in learning self-regulation techniques. There were no decreases in tryptase in four children who were not able to learn the techniques.</P>

<P>An estimated 9% of school-aged children experience migraines.Symptoms include severe pain,
 nausea, and extreme sensitivity to sound and light, lasting from two hours to more than a day.</P>

<P>The study was funded by a grant from the W.T. Grant Foundation in New York. Excluded from participation in the study were children who used preventive medications for migraine, had prior experience with self-regulation training, or had known learning disabilities or health problems.</P>

<P>Rainbow Babies and Childrens Hospital of University Hospitals of Cleveland is dedicated solely to the care of children. With 226 beds, Rainbow is one of the nation's most renowned pediatric medical centers and serves as a principal referral center for Ohio and bordering states. As the primary teaching hospital of Case Western Reserve University, Rainbow ranks sixth in the country in the total amount of National Institutes of Health funding received by any children's hospital. More than $9.8 million in research monies supports more than 30 pediatric research projects. Every new drug approved for use in children has been testing at Rainbow. Rainbow is a national leader in the treatment of children with cancer, heart disease, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, pulmonary disorders and endocrine disorders. More than 350 pediatric specialists representing 30 medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties, are on staff at Rainbow and its 40 special care centers.</P>

<H3>Reading Activities</H3>                   

<P>SORTING AND STACKING -- Teach classification skills with
dinnerware.  Ask your child to match and stack dishes of similar
sizes and shapes.  Also have your child sort flatware -- forks with
forks, spoons with spoons.  This is like recognizing the shapes of
letters and numbers.</P>
         
<P>TELEPHONITIS -- Give your child practice in reading numbers left to
right by dialing a telephone.  Make a list of telephone numbers
your child can read -- for relatives, friends, the weather bureau
-- and have your child make a call or two.</P>
         
<P>LET 'EM EAT SHAPES -- Cut bread into different shapes --
rectangles, triangles, squares, circles.  Make at least two of each
shape.  Ask your youngster to choose a pair of similar shapes, then
to put jam on the first piece, and to place the second piece on top
to make a sandwich.  This is a snack plus a game to match shapes.</P>
         
<P>DRESS ME -- Increase your child's vocabulary.  Teach the name of
each item of clothing your child wears -- shirt, blouse, sweater,
sock, shoe when your child is dressing or undressing.  Also teach
the body parts -- head, arm, knee, foot.  Then print the words on
paper and ask your child to attach these papers to the clothes in
the closet or drawers.  Make a pattern of your child lying on a
large sheet of paper.  Tack it up.  Ask your child to attach the
words for the body parts to the right locations.</P>
         
<P>HIDDEN LETTERS -- Build reading observation skills with this
activity.  Ask your child to look for letters of the alphabet on
boxes and cans of food and household supplies.  For example, find
five A's or three C's, or any number of letters or combinations on
cereal boxes, soup cans, bars of soap.  Start with easy-to-find
letters and build up to harder-to-find ones.  Then have your
children write the letters on paper or point out the letters on the
boxes and cans.</P>

<H3>Writing Activities</H3>
                        
<P>DISAPPEARING LETTERS -- Promote creativity and build muscle control
with a pail of water and a brush.  On a warm day, take your
children outside to the driveway or sidewalk and encourage them to
write anything they wish.  Talk about what they've written.</P>
         
<P>COMIC STRIP WRITING -- Use comic strips to help with writing.  Cut
apart the segments of a comic strip and ask your child to arrange
them in order.  Then ask your child to fill in the words of the
characters (orally or in writing).</P>
         
<P>AND THAT'S THE END OF THE STORY -- Improve listening skills and
imagination.  Read a story aloud to your child and stop before the
end.  Ask the child how the story will turn out.  Then finish the
story and discuss the ending with the child.  Did it turn out the
way you thought?</P>

<H3>Math Activities</H3>
                           
<P>LAUNDRY MATH -- Sharpen skills by doing a necessary household job.
Ask your youngster to sort laundry -- before or after washing.  How
many socks?  How many sheets?  And you may find a lost sock as
well.</P>
         
<P>NAPKIN FRACTIONS -- Make fractions fun.  Fold paper towels or
napkins into large and small fractions.  Start with halves and move
to eighths and sixteenths.  Use magic markers to label the
fractions.</P>
         
<P>WEIGH ME --  Teach estimating skills.  Ask your children to guess
the weight of several household objects -- a waste basket, a coat, a
full glass of water.  Then show children how to use a scale to
weigh the objects.  Next, have them estimate their own weight, as
well as that of other family members, and use the scale to check
their guesses.  Some brave parents get on the scale, too.</P>

<H3>Science Activities</H3>
                         
<P>ICE IS NICE -- Improve observation and questioning skills by
freezing and melting ice.  Add water to an ice cube tray and set it
in the freezer.  Ask your child how long it will take to freeze. 
For variety, use different levels of water in different sections of
the tray.  Set ice cubes on a table.  Ask your child how long they
will take to melt.  Why do they melt?  Place the ice cubes in
different areas of the room.  Do they melt faster in some places
than in others?  Why?</P>

<P>FLOAT AND SINK -- Encourage hypothesizing (guessing).  Use several
objects -- soap, a dry sock, a bottle of shampoo, a wet sponge, an
empty bottle.  Ask your child which objects will float when dropped
into water in a sink or bathtub.  Then drop the objects in the
water, one by one, to see what happens.</P>
         
<P>WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO GROW? -- Teach cause-and-effect relationships.
Use two similar, healthy plants.  Ask your child to water one plant
and ignore the other for a week or two, keeping both plants in the
same place.</P>

<P>At the end of that time, ask your child to water the drooping
plant.  Then talk about what happened and why.  Plants usually perk
up with water just as children perk up with good words and smiles
from parents.</P>

<P>Educational research has made it clear that parents who are
actively involved in their children's learning at home help their
children become more successful learners in and out of school.
During the early adolescent years, adult guidance is especially
important.</P>

<P>Here are some reading, writing, math, and science Home Learning
Recipe activities.  These have been developed by the Home and
School Institute.  Parents of young children in prekindergarten
through third grade find them to be easy and enjoyable ways to work
with the school -- using materials they have at home to build their
children's skills.</P>

<P>Children are eager learners: they are interested in everything
around them.  These easy-to-do activities encourage children's
active learning and those wonderful words of growing confidence, "I
can do it."</P>

<P>Think of these as starter activities to get your ideas going. 
There are opportunities everywhere for teaching and learning.</P>

<H3>Reading Activities</H3>                                     

<P>A LIFETIME OF READING -- Encourage lifelong reading.  Read with
your youngsters by taking roles in stories and acting out dramatic
poems.  Whenever possible, tape record these sessions.  Then listen
to and enjoy these performances together.</P>

<P>STREET SMARTS -- Put reading skills to practical use.  Gather bus
and subway route maps and schedules to a special place in your area
-- the zoo, a museum, a football stadium.  Let your child plan a
trip for friends or family.  Figure out the travel time required,
the cost, and the best time to make the trip.</P>

<P>TV AND THE WORLD -- Connect current events to TV viewing.  Post a
world map next to the TV set.  Watch the TV news with your children
and have them locate world news spots.  Keep reference books such
as dictionaries and the world almanac close by.  In this way,
children find answers to questions when their curiosity is high.</P>

<a name="Writing"></a>
<H3>Writing Activities</H3>

<P>PICTURE STORIES -- Develop imagination and creativity.  Have your
children select four or five pictures from magazines and
newspapers, and put them together to tell a story.  Ask your
children to number the pictures -- 1,2,3, etc.  First, ask them to
tell the story with the pictures in numerical order.  For variety,
have your children rearrange the pictures and tell a new story
using this different arrangement.</P>

<P>WRITING INSTEAD OF TALKING -- Exchange notes instead of words at
different times during the day -- when getting up in the morning,
at dinner, or at bedtime -- or whenever the noise level becomes too
high.</P>

<P>DAY-BY DAY CALENDAR -- Turn a large calendar -- commercial or home
made -- into a personalized family communication center.  Have your
children fill in the blanks with morning messages, weather reports,
birthdays, special activities, or notes to the family.              </P>

<H3>Math Activities</H3>
                   
<P>A TRIP TO THE SUPERMARKET -- Plan ahead with the 3 R's.  Ask your
child to choose a dish to prepare for a meal -- a pudding, a salad,
a sandwich.  Have your child check to see what supplies are on hand
and then make a shopping list.  At the supermarket, let your child
select the food on the list.  First, your child decides which items
are the best buys and makes selections.  Also have your child write
the price of each item on the list and if possible figure the
total, checking the prices against the sales receipt.</P>

<P>ON THE MOVE -- Sharpen math skills on trips.  Use even short trips
around town.  For example, at the gas station, ask your child how
much gas you needed and the cost per gallon.  On the highway, ask
your children to read the signs and check the different speed
limits.  Then ask them to watch the speedometer readings and notice
how fast or slow the car is going.  Have your children estimate
distances between cities and check the estimates on a road map.     </P>

<P>NEWSPAPER MATH -- Use the Weather section to check temperatures
across the nation and the world.  This is good geography practice,
too.  Discuss baseball and football scores and averages on the
sports pages.  Who are the high scores?  What are the percentages?

<H3>Social Studies Activities</H3>                     

<P>A CLOSER LOOK -- Help your children become aware of family
responsibilities.  Make a chart of family chores, including the
name of the person responsible, the days and time required, etc.
Discuss ways to change or improve these job assignments.</P>

<P>HISTORY TIME LINE -- Record history at home.  Stretch a roll of
shelf paper along the floor.  Use a ruler to make a line about
three feet long.  (Use a separate sheet for each child.)  Ask your
children to fill in the important dates in their own lives,
starting with their birth.  Those familiar with U.S. history can
fill in major dates since the founding of our country.  Display
these finished time lines in a special place for all to see.</P>

<P>THE FOREIGN TOUCH -- Travel abroad at home.  Visit ethnic shops,
food stores, and restaurants in your community.  Before the trip,
have your children find on a map different countries you will
"visit."  After the trip, encourage your children to talk about
what they have seen.</P>

<P>These activities may sound too easy to do any good.  Make no
mistake.  They work.</P>

<H3>Reading Activities

<P>READ ALL ABOUT IT -- Introduce your child to the many kinds of
information in the daily newspaper.  Ask your child to find the
pages containing news about government leaders, editor's opinions,
weather reports, car sales, house and apartment rentals, and want
ads.  Discuss how to use this information.</P>

<P>FOLLOW THE NEWS -- As a family, choose an important news event to
follow for a day or two.  Ask each person to find as much
information on the topic as possible -- read newspapers, listen to
the radio, watch TV news.  Then talk about what everyone learned.</P>

<a name="Writing"></a>
<H3>Writing Activities
</H3>                        

<P>NICE WORDS -- Make someone happy.  Write each family member's name
on separate sheets of paper.  Add a note or a drawing -- for
example, "I like the way you make breakfast," or "You make me happy
when you do the dishes."  Fold the paper and put them in a bag. 
Ask each person to choose a paper from the bag.  Place the notes
where they can be found by family members.  And watch for the
smiles!</P>

<P>LOOKING AT ADVERTISEMENTS -- Take a closer look.  Help your
children improve their thinking and writing skills by looking
carefully at newspaper, magazine, and TV advertisements.  What is
the main point of the ad?  What details does it use to communicate
its message?  For example, a strong, handsome man holding a soft
drink in an expensive car with a beautiful woman at his side is
telling us something about the soft drink.</P>

<P>PRO AND CON: WHAT DO YOU THINK? -- Make a family game of discussing
a special issue -- for example, "Teenagers should be allowed to
vote," or "There should never be any homework."  Ask your
youngsters to think of all the reasons they can to support their
views.  Then, ask them to think of reasons against their views. 
Which views are most convincing?  For variety, assign family
members to teams and have teams prepare their arguments pro and
con.</P>

<H3>Math Activities
</H3>

<P>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? -- Put math skills to work.  Help your
children understand living costs by discussing household expenses
with them.  For example, make a list of monthly bills -- heat,
electricity, telephone, mortgage or rent.  Fold the paper to hide
the costs and ask your youngsters to guess the cost of each item.
Unfold the paper.  How do the estimates compare with the actual
costs?  Were they close?</P>

<P>MATH MARKS -- Are they really necessary?  Ask your children to look
through the newspaper to find and list as many percentages and
decimal numbers as possible -- sale prices, sports scores, bank
rates.  Ask what would happen without those close?</P>

<P>LIVING WITHIN OUR MEANS -- Teach children who have allowances or
regular spending money how to budget.  Ask them to make a
two-column list of expenses and income.  Under expenses, they list
what they expect to spend for movies, bus tokens, lunches, etc.
Then, have your youngsters add all the expenses and subtract the
total from the income.  Ask them to think of ways to reduce their
spending.  If their income is more than their expenses, talk about
a savings plan.</P>

<H3>Social Studies Activities
</H3>                     

<P>EXPANDING HORIZONS -- Help your child learn about people from
different countries.  Suggest talking to neighbors from foreign
countries, reading library books about other cultures, reading
newspapers, and watching TV specials.</P>

<P>LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD -- Promote good citizenship.  Help your
child write a letter to the editor of the local newspaper about an
issue affecting children.  For example, suggest that a bike path be
built near the school or that a city event be planned for

<P>STRETCH, RUN, BIKE -- Ask your child to do at least one kind of
exercise every day.  For example, run or walk briskly for 10
minutes.  Walk, when possible, instead of riding, for any distance
less than a mile.  Have your youngster make a week-long exercise
plan.  Try to think of a modest reward for sticking to the plan and
exercise right along with your child.</P>

<P>Educational research has made it clear that parents who are
actively involved in their children's learning at home help their
children become more successful learners in and out of school.
During the early adolescent years, adult guidance is especially
important.</P>

<P>Here are some reading, writing, math, social studies and health
Home Learning Recipe activities.  These have been developed by the
Home and School Institute.  Parents of sixth to eighth graders find
them to be easy and enjoyable ways to work with the school -- using
materials they have at home to build their children's skills. 
These activities will also help preteens and parents talk together
about matters both care about, which improve family communication
at this crucial time.</P>

<P>Remember -- keep the talk flowing.  It's the stuff high test scores
are made of and it's the basis for parent/child closeness.</P>

<P>Think of these as starter activities to get your ideas going. 
There are opportunities everywhere for teaching and learning.</P>
