<P>On Good Laboratory Practice Standards for Toxicological
Studies on Agricultural Chemicals</P>

<P>Some countries have been adopting a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for proper conduct of
toxicological studies in recent years.</P>
<P>In Japan, the safety of an agricultural chemical has been ensured strictly and thoroughly. 
However, to make more accurate
and strict evaluation of an agricultural chemical, Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLP
Standards) is intended to be
introduced in view of the conspicuous progress of toxicological and related studies as well as
enhancement of capability of
Japanese testing facility (hereinafter referred to as "testing facility").</P>
<P>Since GLP Standards will contribute to further improvement of the standards and
certification system and to promotion
of the vitality of private sectors, the introduction of GLP Standards has been seriously awaited

by
  a testing facility which has failed to comply with the requirements of the good laboratory
practice
  regulations until it can be adequately demonstrated that such noncompliance did not occur

until
  the facility can satisfy the Commissioner that it will conduct studies in compliance with such
  regulations.
  </DL>
  <DT>(b) The determination that a nonclinical laboratory study may not be considered in
support of

  <DL>
  <DT>(a) The testing facility failed to comply with one or more of the regulations set forth in
this
  part (or any other regulations regarding such facilities in this chapter);
  <DT>(b) The noncompliance adversely affected the validity of the nonclinical laboratory
studies;
  and

  conducted by the disqualified testing facility may be examined to determine whether such study
  was or would be essential to a decision. If it is determined that a study was or would be
essential,
  the Food and Drug Administration shall also determine whether the study is acceptable,
  notwithstanding the disqualification of the facility. Any study done by a testing facility before
or
  after disqualification may be presumed to be unacceptable, and the person relying on the study
  may be required to establish that the study was not affected by the circumstances that led to the
  disqualification, e.g., by submitting validating information. If the study is then determined to be
  unacceptable, such data will be eliminated from consideration in support of the application; and
  such elimination may serve as new information justifying the termination or withdrawal of
approval
  of the application.
  <DT>(b) No nonclinical laboratory study begun by a testing facility after the date of the

<P>WRITER: Kathy Pharr, (706) 542-5172<BR>
SOURCE: Tom Schoenbaum, (706) 542-5140</P>

<P>    The next time you're in the grocery store, check the label  on a can of tuna. If it reads "dolphin safe," you're witnessing  the conflict between international trade and environmental law.</P>

<P>    "It's only been in the past three years that trade and the  environment have come together," said law professor Tom  Schoenbaum, director of the UGA School of Law's Dean Rusk Center  for International and Comparative Law. "Before the tuna/dolphin  dispute, international trade was perceived as completely separate  from environmental questions. If you worked in one field, you  didn't work in the other."</P>

<P>    The change was triggered when the United States, reacting to  the drowning of dolphins entangled in the nets of Southeast  Pacific fishermen, adopted a ban on tuna harvested through  dolphin-threatening techniques. A dispute resolution panel of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) found the United  States in violation of its international free trade obligations.  Under GATT rules, countries cannot restrict free trade in  products unless the product is unsafe to humans. But in a rapidly  shrinking world, environmental protection is beginning to make  waves in international trade disputes.</P>

<P>    "Trade no longer stops at the border. Now it affects the  internal laws and regulations of other countries," Schoenbaum  said. "It's a question of making exceptions. Free trade is a  value, but not a value that is limitless. At the same time, you  have to realize that there are some instances where environmental  protection is an excuse for protectionism. It's a question of how  to draw the line."</P>

<P>    Unlike many other legal scholars, Schoenbaum has studied  both environmental law and international trade law extensively.  Recently he has been poring over the 22,000-page legal document  that establishes the new World Trade Organization (which replaces  the GATT) and the 5,000-page text of the North American Free  Trade Agreement.</P>

<P>    "International lawmaking is very difficult because it's so  entwined with international politics," Schoenbaum said. "There is  no international legislature. You build the laws on prior  experience, but mainly they are the result of international  diplomatic relations. It's an enormous process of consensus- making which often takes years.</P>

<P>    "The legal research process involves gathering sources of  law, analyzing and synthesizing the information, and discussing  theories with government officials, scholars and writers all over  the world," he said. </P>

<P>    Although the tuna/dolphin dispute still has not been  resolved, Schoenbaum predicts that ongoing negotiations will soon  result in a decision favorable for the United States. Mexico,  which originally petitioned the GATT panel, is now showing  flexibility following the passage of NAFTA. </P>

<P>    "American values and ideas pass into the international legal  order through American influence," he said. "The United States  has the largest influence of any country. However, the United  States doesn't have the only influence. We must work with other  countries and accommodate their interests and values."</P>

<P>    Because of his widely acknowledged expertise in both  international trade and environmental law, Schoenbaum is  consulted regularly by state, national and international policy  makers. As author of the pre-eminent casebook on environmental  law and a three-volume treatise, Admiralty and Maritime Law, he  is notably qualified to provide such counsel. His economic and  environmental impact report on NAFTA, which proved to be a  powerful lobbying tool for its passage, was lauded by Sen. Sam  Nunn as "the best analysis I have seen done on the subject."</P>

<P>    Schoenbaum said he expects that another U.S. trade law  eventually will be challenged in the international arena: a 1990  ban on the export of raw logs from certain West Coast states. The  justification for the law, according to Congress, was  conservation.</P>

<P>    "If you look at what is actually happening, it's really an  export ban that has no basis in conservation. It's  protectionist," Schoenbaum said. "The object of that lumber law  was to create jobs for industries that process the logs. While  that may seem like a great idea at first, you have to realize the  consequence of the action -- other countries will do it to us,  and several have already. Indonesia and the Philippines, just to  name a few, have passed the same law."</P>

<P>    Schoenbaum has worked to develop trade regulations for  protecting endangered species and the ozone layer, and for  deciding whether a country may ban a product because it objects  to how it is made.</P>

<P>    "My personal conclusions are that we have to find a way for  international treaties to be upheld; that there is a proper scope  for unilateral action to protect resources like dolphins, but we  have to find a way to restrain unilateral action generally; and  we have to find a way to adopt minimum environmental, labor and  human rights standards without imposing U.S. values on the rest  of the world," he said.</P>

<P>    Those are tall orders.</P>

<P>    "International trade attorneys and environmental attorneys  aren't enemies," Schoenbaum said. "Both sides of their arguments  have positive values and need to be protected. What we must do is  rationalize where they come into conflict."</P>

 <B>FDA/SQA DISCUSSION</B><P>
On April 27, 1993, a Board appointed subcomminee of the
         RRC met with Dr. Paul Lepore and Dr. George James of
         the Food and Drug Administration, to discuss issues with
         current regulatory relevance. Agenda items were solicited
         from RRC members and all attendees were provided with an
         agenda in advance of the meeting.<P>
         
INTRODUCTION<P>
         
         Dr. Lepore opened the session with a statement relative to
         his concern that the agenda questions had surfaced from time
         to time and that all had been answered before in some format.
         Upon further consideration allowed that many of these questions ultimately, reflect
responsibilities and concerns of facility management. He prefaced the formal agenda with
discussion providing insight on Agency policy and operations. He
         described various ways the FDA notifies and/or makes known
         through publication, the policies and procedures that affect
         both FDA and industry relative to the GLP Regulations. He
         was asked if they could be categorized and made available to
         industry through a mailing or catalog of sorts. He indicated
         that this would be impossible since there is no consistent
         mechanism for collation and publication of this information,
         particularly, since some GLP policies originate in other FDA
         offices. Also, he could not, nor did he wish to take on the
         burden of sending such information to SQA, or any other
         organization. It was recognized that we (SQA) can be apprised of new documents through
our FDA liaison. It was
         suggested that in the liaison's quarterly conferences with Dr.
         Lepore, specific questions be asked that address the availability of recent policies and
procedures that affect the industry
         and/or FDA.<P>
         
         Dr. Lepore then discussed how the Agency works and
         provided references for his public remarks. Most of his
         comments or answers come directly from the regulations and
         associated preambles. When questioned on whether Agency
         policies are open to interpretation, Dr. Lepore responded that
         they are, during the comment period after publication in the
         FederaI Register. He defined regulation and policy, from an
         FDA perspective. A regulation is an interpretation of the law
         and binds both industry and the FDA. A policy binds only
         the Agency, although it contains useful advice on regulatory
         compliance. Preambles to final regulations are FDA policy;
         it was acknowledged that these may be subjective and difficult to interpret.<P>
         
         Dr. Lepore's references were provided to us and are available under FOI. The policies,
procedures and technical reports are used by FDA to interpret the GLP Regulations.<P>

<BR><B>AGENDA<P>
 <A NAME=  oct93-1">        
         <I>QUESTION 1:</A>  What kinds of studies must conform with GLP
Regulations?</B></I>
         
         Recently, the CPMP published a statement addressing the
         applicability of good laboratory practices to safety tests. In
         this statement, ten study types were defined as safety tests,
         and must therefore comply with good laboratory practice
         described in Directives 87/18/EEC and 88/320/EEC.<p>
 <OL>        
 <LI>What is FDA's position on applicability of GLP to
         each of these study types?<BR>
         
<LI>How do you define "safety pharmacology"? Should
         GLPs be applied to safety pharmacology and ADME
         studies?<BR>
<LI>To what areas might FDA's GLP regulations be extended? Specifically, might they be
extended to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics studies submitted in support of an IND or
NDA?<P>
</OL>         
<B><I>ANSWER 1:</B></I>  Dr. Lepore emphasized that the GLP applicability of a
         study is determined by l) type of product, and 2) objective of
         the study (i.e., safety) rather than title. Therefore, in reviewing the study types included on
the CPMC list, he concluded
         that study types 1-6 are clearly covered by FDA GLPs. He
         could not comment on 7, (local tolerance) because the study
         objective was not clear. As for 8 and 9, (toxicokinetic and
         pharmacokinetic studies), these are not included in the scope
         of FDA GLPs. He also indicated that he did not know the
         intent of 10 (studies that seem to be peripherally related to
         safety). Regarding "safety pharmacology , Dr. Lepore stated
         that he did not know what this term means. He said that as
         far as he was concerned, safety pharmacology and ADME
         studies are those designed to study the mechanism of an
         action and as such, are not under the scope of the GLPs; only
         "safety" studies, by objective come under the scope of GLPs.
         Although ECcountries require ADME studies to comply with
         GLPs, Dr. Lepore was not sure why. He added that to date,
         no U.S. "ADME" studies have been rejected in the EC for
         noncompliance with GLPs.<p>
         
         FDA has no intention of changing the scope of the GLP
         Regulations; in particular, the scope of FDA GLPs would not
         be expanded to include pharmacodynamic studies.  In establishing the original scope of the
regulations, pharmacology
         studies were specifically excluded.  Usually exploratory studies are not done to support
safety claims, and are often
         followed by a "GLPstudy". FDA may, however, require that
         an exploratory study be redone to comply with the GLPs if
         the study has value in supporting product safety. Furthermore, FDA may inspect a
non-GLP study to assess facility
         operations/management. The agency may audit or inspect
         any study submitted in an IND against any standards they
         choose, because any study submitted in an official filing
         should be of sufficient quality to support regulatory decision-making.<p>

<B><I>QUESTION 2:</A>  How does/will harmonization impact existing MOUs with EC
member countries?</B></I><P>
  <OL>       
<LI>What is FDA's position regarding an MOU with the
         EC?<BR>
<LI> In countries where there is no current MOU, will FDA
         inspect? Can we expect those countries to inspect in
         the US?<P>
</OL>
<BR>         
<B><I>ANSWER 2:</B></I> Dr. Lepore explained that MOUs really aren 't necessary
         as they were used as transitional mechanisms while other
         countries were coming into compliance and establishing their
         own GLP programs. FDA, however, has been negotiating an
         MOU with the EC for the past two years; considerations
         include:<P>
<OL>         
<LI> All existing bilateral MOUs will remain intact (Germany,
         Italy, France and the Netherlands)<BR>
<LI> Equivalency must be demonstrated. All EC countries
         must have GLP programs as effective as that in the US<BR>
<LI> FDA made it clear that they will NOT work through the
         EC but instead will continue to work directly with their
         Agency 's counterpart in each country as the EC has no
         inspectorate.<P>
</OL>         
         The five year MOU with the UK/FDA/EPA expired in
         March 1993 and cannot be reinstated or re-negotiated since
         the EC requires that they negotiate all future MOUs. FDA
         highly regards the UK inspection program and doesn 't feel
         that an MOU is really necessary with the UK because of their
         fine working relationship. Regarding foreign inspections,
         FDA can and will continue to inspect any lab in the world
         regardless of legal jurisdiction or the presence or absence of
         an MOU. Foreign countries, generally, have not inspected
         any US firms nor have they asked FDA to conduct inspections
         for them. Of note, the US is the only country where inspection
         is closely associated with the product approval process. The
         programs that are in place in Europe are independent and
         the respective GLP inspectorates have no idea what studies
         are included in INDs and NDAs.<P>

What can we expect with regard to the "Good Academic

industry?</B></I><P>
         
<B><I>ANSWER 3:</B></I> This draft guideline, intended only for academic institutions was
prepared by the Pilot Drug Division because of
         problems encountered in drug abuse/safety potential studies FDA conducted pilot studies in
academic institutions to assess the ability to reconstruct these pharmacology studies.
         Dr. Harter's division issued this draft as an internal document only and it never was
published in the Federal Register
         for comment. Dr. James indicated that it is unlikely that this
         guideline will become "official".<P>

<B><I>QUESTION 4:</A>  Computers and Computer Validation</B></I><p>
         
         Can/will you discuss the outcome of the Pilot Computer Validation Initiative?<P>
<OL>         
<LI> Will that impact routine GLP facility inspections? If
         so, how?<BR>
<LI>         
         What is currently being inspected and observed with
         regard to computer validation? What is the inspection
         standard and how is it being applied?<BR>

     What about source code for purchased systems? Who
         should have custody? Should it be "inspected"? Is
         developer's validation acceptable?<P>
</OL>
<B><I>ANSWER 4:</B></I> Six facilities were inspected by FDA in a Pilot Computer
         Validation Initiative. Each facility was issued an FD-483.
         Since EIRs have not been completed or released for all
         facilities, Dr. Lepore and Dr. James could not comment,
         except to say that they are not pleased with the outcomes
         based on the 483 citings. Dr. Snipes, who participated in all
         six inspections, will summarize findings and make recommendations.  Although there is no
time frame for this report, it
         will be available under FOI when it is released. It is possible
         that the outcome of the inspections could lead to revision of
         the GLP Compliance Program Guidance Manual. At least
         nine additional laboratories are targeted for inspection in
         1993, computer validation being the key focus of these inspections.<P>
         
         Dr. Lepore described FDA 's inspection standard for conducting computer inspections. The
Agency's concern is to
         determine that the facility's computer systems are operating
         properly, did so in the past and will continue to do so in the
         future. He was not sure of how field investigators are assessing this (i.e., what standards
they are using) but did acknowledge that more computer validation issues are cited on 483s
         by the Agency 's "computer experts ", giving him the sense that
         "non-experts" may not be asking the right questions. There is a difference in standards
applied in GLP and GMP inspections. Software is regulated by function and can be prioritized as
follows:<P>
<UL>         
<LI>         Software used to monitor and regulate the blood supply
         (highest priority)<BR>
<LI>         
         Software used in critical medical device operation/function (very strict)<BR>
<LI>         
         Software used in the drug (product) manufacturing
         process<BR>
<LI>         
         Software used in GLP studies<P>
</UL>         
         Regarding purchased systems, the same standards apply
         to both purchaser and vendor. Vendor supplied and internally developed software are
regulated the same way, the only
         difference being in-house activities conducted by the purchaser. In a bought system, you
can only look at historical
         information, since you don 't create it. The purchaser must
         have access to source code, especially if changes will be
         made. The critical issue is access, not custody; it is perfectly
         acceptable to maintain software by controlled access, such
         as escrow. Change control documentation must be maintained the same way. Developer
validation is acceptable if
         reviewed by the purchaser . The purchaser must be comfort-
         able with the product and should review/approve changes.<P>
         
         GLPs have always permitted electronic signatures.<P>

 <A NAME=  oct93-5">        
   <B><I>QUESTION 5:</A> Data storage and record retention</B></I>
<UL>         
<LI> When an on-line data collection system is being used,
         what do you expect to find in the data files? Is it
         acceptable to store all data in the computer, or do you
         expect to see printouts? Is it acceptable to generate
         printouts on request or should they be archived? What
         about use of optical disks for data storage?<BR>
<LI> To improve the efficiency of operations and data
         quality, facilities are constantly upgrading or replacing computer hardware and software.
If, for example,
         we replace an on-line data collection system with
         something different, what would an FDA investigator
         wish to see for a study done using the old system?<BR>
<LI> Extrapolate old system/new system concept to regulatory submissions (i.e., IND or NDA).
What about electronic submissions?<P>
</UL>
<B><I>ANSWER 5:</I></B>   If a computer system is being used for data collection, data
         verification, quality assurance and data storage, then procedures must be in place to
determine who did what and when
         it was done. For documentation of these operations, electronic signature is acceptable.
Procedures must be able to
         flag erroneous information or non-conduct of the above
         operations. FDA does not expect the study director to review
         all data, but should review some; there should be provision
         for co-worker review and supervisor review and documented
         evidence that this was done.<P>
         
         Printouts should be generated if a system can routinely
         reprint data. Investigators do expect you to make printouts
         on request. For systems that are replaced or changed, FDA
         expects to see printouts of all appropriate data as well as
         enhancements.<P>
         
         Optical disks are permissible for data storage. Neither
         Dr. Lepore nor Dr. James commented on electronic submissions.<P>

<B><I>QUESTION 6:</A> Quality Assurance</B></I><P>
         
         Quality Assurance responsibilities are clearly defined in
         the GLP requirements, yet frequently, there seems to be
         expectations of the QAU that exceed those described in the
         GLPs.<P>
         
          In your opinion, in which related areas would you
         expect to find QA involvement? Where would you
         like to see QA involvement that you currently don't?
         Identify the areas that you've seen QAUs involved in
         that are clearly inappropriate.<P>

         <B><I>ANSWER 6:</B></I>
         Officially, Dr. Lepore expects to see QA personnel doing
         their GLP defined essential duties and has not seen QA
         involvement in inappropriate areas. His personal opinion,
         however, implies that quality assurance is essential in any
         area where the quality of the end product can't be easily
         measured.  He clarified the difference between QA and QC.
         For example, since you can 't measure the quality of a final
         report, you must have in-process quality assurance whereas,
         for a manufactured product, you can measure the final quality, therefore, quality control is
critical. Quality assurance
         principles are applied when you can 't measure the quality of
         the end product.<p>
         
         Regarding GLP studies, Dr. James and Dr. Lepore concur
         that greater emphasis should be placed on monitoring in-life
         processes, instead of looking at records at the end of the study.
         QA is expected to be actively involved in reviewing laboratory
         operations; 30-40% of QA time should be spent conducting
         phase and process inspections. Dr. Lepore stated that when
         there are post-inspection 483 f ndings, management has not
         been adequately involved. Previously, he had attributed
         these citations to inadequate QA.<P>
         
         It is okay for QA to have responsibility for the archives, as
         FDA doesn't view the archives as a study activity. Archiving
         is a post study phase and not directly related to study conduct.<P>

         etc.) and how often? Can consultants be used to

<B><I>ANSWER 7:</I></B>         
         Ultimately, compliance is the sponsor's responsibility,
         therefore, the sponsor is expected to assure that the laboratory can comply with the GLPs.
The sponsor is only required
         to notify the contract facility that a study will be conducted
         under GLPs. The sponsor should take an active role with the
         contractors they use; at minimum there should be routine site
         visits and regular communication. QA should also actively
         participate by conducting site visits at appropriate intervals.
         Since it is the sponsor who signs the compliance statement in
         the NDA, the sponsor is responsible to decide the level of
         oversight required to ensure study quality and integrity.<P>

<B><I>QUESTION 7A:</I></B>           
         The Subject of Subcontracted Studies Raised Several Questions.<P>
   Sometimes a facility can't conduct all phases of a particular study because of lack of expertise,
workload/staffing
         or reasons of confidentiality and must subcontract certain
         parts. In these cases, what is the study director's responsibility for components of the study
not under his/her control? <P>

<I><B>ANSWER 7A:  </B></I>Dr. Lepore places overall responsibility for
         compliance with the sponsor. The protocol must define
         specific responsibilities; results should be reported by the
         lab performing the work and the sponsor can provide a
         written summary providing a complete study overview.
         Compliance is addressed in a written statement.<P>
         
<BR>         
<I><B>QUESTION 7B:</B></I> The following scenario was presented to Dr. Lepore and
         he commented as follows: If a study is being conducted
         at Lab A and specimens will be sent to Lab B, do QA
         reports pertaining to Lab B activities have to be sent to the
         study director at Lab A? <P>
<I><B>ANSWER 7B:  </B></I>
QA reports of Lab B do not have
         to be sent to the study director at Lab A; however, Lab B
         facility management must receive them. It is important to note that this interpretation
contradicts GLPs which require QA reports be submitted to the study director.<P>

<B><I>QUESTION 8:</A>  Vendor Audits</B></I><P>
         
         How do you view vendor audits? Do you consider
         them essential for any particular products or services?
         What about for software? How extensive should they
         be?<P>
<B><I>ANSWER 8:</I></B>        
         FDA has no authority to inspect most vendors, since they
         do not make regulated products. If the vendor refused inspection, FDA would have very
little recourse. If QA should
         inspect a vendor and find problems, the inspector should
         inform his/her management.<P>

         The subject of interactions between FDA and USDA con-

         Are GLP standards are being applied to an area clearly
         not covered by the GLP regulations?<P>
         
         Specifically why is participation of Quality Assurance
         on the IACUC deemed a conflict of interest by the
         FDA?<P>
  <BR>   
<B><I>ANSWER 9:</I></B>        
         QA can certainly be a non-voting member of the IACUC,
         and facility management should support such participation;
         however, the QA representative should not chair the committee nor be a voting member. A
conflict ensues because QA is
         responsible for monitoring procedures used in the IACUC
         protocols; therefore that individual should not be involved in
         the review and approval processes for those protocols and
         procedures.<P>
         
         FDA 's authority to inspect IACUC activities is within the
         scope of GLPs as SOPs are required for all study activities.
         A facility should have an SOP governing its IACUC. The
         QAU should include IACUC activities in its inspection program.<P>

<B><I>QUESTION 10:  </A>To what standards are FDA laboratories held in testing
         of regulated products?</B></I><P>
 <BR>
<B><I>ANSWER 10:</I></B>        
         FDA will take regulated products off the shelf and send
         them to district laboratories or specialized laboratories anywhere in the country for
analysis. Test standards for regulatory samples are "the highest standards in the world" and
         results of these may be used in court. FDA has three laboratories with high technical
standards, but may fall short with
         regard to GLP compliance. (Dr. Lepore equated the compliance level for government labs
with that of academia.) The
         Washington lab does not comply with GLPs and is not used
         for any regulated testing.  The FDA labs are:<P>
 <OL>        
<LI> National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR).
         This is a prime laboratory and has been used as a
         training center for the FDA. It is GLP compliant.<BR>
<LI>  Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (FSAN). This lab,
         located in downtown Washington, DC, is not GLP
         compliant. The Beltsville laboratory is a replacement
         for FSAN but hasn't been completed yet; therefore, it

</UL> 
  <BR>   
<B><I>ANSWER 11:</I></B>       
         If environmental assessment studies are done to demonstrate environmental safety (NEPA),
they contribute to determination of product safety and are required to comply with
         GLPs. This is not a new requirement and it is not necessary
         to amend the GLPs to cover these studies as EA studies are
         currently not excluded from the scope of the GLPs (preamble). CVM has had
environmental guidelines since 1972-1973; however, it is only recently that FDA is requesting
EA
         data for human pharmaceuticals.  If EA studies are done
         in-house, they should be on the Master Schedule; they could
         be inspected as part of a routine GLP surveillance inspection.
         As GLP studies, these could be the subject of routine FDA
         inspections. If EA studies do not comply with GLPs, they
         could be rejected by the Agency; CVMhas already done so.<P>

         The Fraud Policy is invoked in cases of suspect fraud or

         and there are currently 24 companies operating under the
         policy. Most of the companies are generic drug manufacturers; no cases have been closed
at this time. Under the policy,

<B><I>ANSWER 15:</I></B>      
         The CVM Inspection program is part of the Bioresearch
         Monitoring Program. The Bioresearch Monitoring Program
         consists of four components in the Center for Drugs: GLPs,
         Institutional Review Boards, Sponsors Monitors and Clinical
         Investigators. The program is analogous for CVM; however,
         their focus is on the Clinical lnvestigators. In October 1992,
         CVM issued Sponsor Monitor guidelines for animal clinical
         trials; these, like most, resulted after a problem was identified Although these resemble
GLPs the scope is limited to clinical studies.<P>

<BR>       <B><I>CLOSING REMARKS</I></B><P>
         
         Dr. Lepore expressed concern over the number of 483s being issued. He stated that
Agency-wide, 17,000 inspections are conducted each year and 5% are classified as VAI-3 or
OAI. In his review of GLP 483s, he said it was hard to tell if the items listed were an of QAU or
Management. He has collected all 483s issued over the last two years and wants to somehow
evaluate these, come to an understanding of the problems and then advise industry of his
conclusions. He is still not sure of what approach to take. He also emphasized that some items
appearing on 483s did not belong there. What goes on a 483 is directed by:<P>
<OL>  
<LI> Compliance Program Guidance Manuals<BR>
<LI> Memo written by R. Chesemore, Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs,
indicating that significant systematic problems belong on the 483 and not one-time occurrences
of problems unless, they impact studies.<BR>
<LI> Customs of the Local District<P>
</OL>
         To summarize, only significant systematic problems (e.g.
         missing SOPs) belong on an FDA-483. One time examples
         of problems should not go on a 483, except if it impacts a
         study. Too often, however, insignificant items are appearing
         on 483s. He expressed concern that facilities are too often
         evaluated by their 483s. Also, the US is the only country that
         issues 483s and he doesn't want our industry/country penalized by all these 483s. He
concluded by saying that the 19
         new investigators that attend the July FDA training program
         will not leave without knowing how to write an FDA-483.<P>

<P>The Good Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs) are federal regulations promulgated in the
United States by both the <A HREF="./fdaglp_a.html">Food and Drug Administration in 21
CFR Part 58</A> and the Environmental Protection Agency both for <A
HREF="./epaglp_a.html">FIFRA</A> in 40 CFR Part 160 and for <A
HREF="./tscatoc.html">TSCA</A> in 40 CFR Part 792.  In Japan, the<A
HREF="./mafftoc.html"> Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF)</A> has also
adapted a version of the GLP's.</P>

<P>The Good Laboratory Practice regulations describe the minimal standards for conducting
nonclinical laboratory studies that
support or are intended to support applications for research or marketing permits for products
regulated by FDA or EPA such as animal food additives, human and animal drugs, medical
devices for human use, biological products, electronic products, or pesticide products. The
regulations do not pertain to studies utilizing human subjects or clinical studies for which the
current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP) standards would apply. Nor do the GLPs pertain to basic
exploratory studies carried out to determine whether a test article has any potential utility or, for
FDA studies only, to determine physical or chemical characteristics of a test article.</P>

<P>In brief generalities and without being comprehensive, the following practices must be
adhered to for compliance with the standards:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A Sponsor is required to notify the testing facility that the study must comply with the
GLPs.

<LI>Personnel records must be available to prove adequate education, training and experience to
enable the individual to perform the assigned functions.

<LI>Testing Facility Management must be identified to designate or replace the Study Director,
to assure the presence of a Quality Assurance Unit, the characterization of test and control
articles, and to assure the presence of adequate personnel, resources, facilities, equipment,

<LI>The Study Director must be designated as the single source of study control who assures
that the protocol is approved and followed, that all experimental data are recorded, that the GLPs
are followed, and that all raw data, documentation, protocols, specimens, and final reports are
archived.

<LI>A Quality Assurance Unit must exist to assure management that facilities, personnel,
practices and records are in compliance with regulations, to maintain a master schedule sheet of
studies, to inspect each nonclinical study at intervals to assure compliance and to report findings
to Study Director and Management, to review the final report to assure that it accurately reflects
the raw data, and to prepare and sign a QA statement in the final report.

<LI>Equipment shall have standard operating procedures (SOPs) describing their use,
maintenance, and calibration.

TIPPING THE SCALES IN FAT RESEARCH</b>

<p>In their battle of the bulge, overweight Americans vie with more than just a few unwanted pounds. The greater stakes are the increased risks of heart disease, diabetes and some kinds of cancer to which fat can contribute.

<p>And since one in three Americans is obese, it's all the more important that scientists pinpoint how  and why some people are more prone to put on pounds.

<p>"Being overweight is a serious health risk," said Roy Martin, head of the University of Georgia's  foods and nutrition department. "Obesity contributes to each of the seven leading causes of death in the  United States, and they account for 80 percent of all mortalities."

<p>Obesity -- which medical scientists define as tipping the scales at 20 percent or more of your  recommended weight -- is as complex a problem as it is grave. Biological, psychological and even social  factors can all contribute to the process by which your body stores energy in fat cells.

<p>This intricate interplay forces scientists to explore many different ways the body and mind control  our consumption of calories -- and how they all work together. For instance, the brain and digestive,  nervous and circulatory systems all have a role to play in weight gain.

<p>For more than two decades Martin has investigated the biological causes of obesity. He directs a  team of researchers whose findings may one day lead to more effective ways to control or even prevent  obesity.

<p>Highlights of the team's findings on how the brain and body communicate about food  consumption, stored fat and satiety (the "I'm full; stop eating" message) include:

<ul>
<li>When food is restricted, the body generates a powerful appetite stimulant called neuropeptide Y, or NPY  for short. When fed a low-protein diet in the laboratory, young animals overeat and generate NPY.

<li>The kind of fat you eat -- saturated versus unsaturated-- may influence what else you eat, including whether you choose high-carbohydrate foods.

<li>Glucose levels in the brain may help determine how much you eat.

<li>When underfed animals are allowed to "pig out," they gain weight until they reach a normal weight and then stop overeating -- unlike humans, who tend to keep putting on the pounds.

<li>Fat cells are capable of generating a chemical that causes weight loss and suppresses appetite so much that it inhibits eating for two to three days.
</ul>

<p><b>The Brain Behind the Behavior</b>

<p>What, when and how much you eat begins in the brain. But just how your brain knows the body's  metabolism and energy reserves is the key question for Martin's team.

<p>One thing's for sure: The control mechanisms that help maintain a stable weight over long periods  of time are extra-ordinarily precise.

<p>"Nobody knows how, but the body has to communicate with the brain somehow and then make  changes in the brain that tell it we've eaten enough or let's change our behavior because we're getting fat,"  said UGA research nutritionist Doug White. "It's probably not just one thing, either."

<p>White studies chemical signals that relay information from the body to the brain. He is particularly  interested in signals that cause predictable eating responses -- such as increasing the appetite -- and  precisely where and how the brain receives those signals.

<p>For example, one of these signals is a cortisone-like substance produced by the adrenal glands.  Called GCC, or glucocorticoid, this protein molecule interacts with certain parts of the brain to influence  food consumption and affect obesity.

<p>"The adrenal glands are important in the expression of obesity," White said. "Whether rats are fat  because of dietary or genetic factors, removal of the adrenal glands makes them thin."

<p>Even genetically obese rats never become fat if their  adrenal glands are removed. But give those  same animals replacement doses of GCC, and they plump right up.

<p>At first scientists thought the adrenal glands were over-producing GCC, causing the rats to be  obese. White, however, found that faulty brain wiring was a more likely culprit.

<p>His experiments showed that GCC stimulates certain brain areas to produce NPY, the most  powerful appetite stimulant known. Quite naturally when the level of NPY is elevated, it leads to more  food consumption and a bigger appetite.

<p> White also has explored how various diets affect NPY production in the hypothalamus -- the brain  region that regulates metabolic processes. He studied the effects of six diets -- two low in protein, two low  in fat and two low in carbohydrate content -- but all containing the same number of calories.

<p>"Our hypothesis was that restricting carbohydrates would stimulate an increase in NPY synthesis,  but that's not the way it turned out," White said. "When protein was restricted, the levels of NPY  [production] increased but there was no effect with fat- or carbohydrate-restricted diets."

<p>With funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, White also compared the effects of low-protein diets   (10 percent protein instead of the usual 20 percent) on young versus mature rats. While the young rats  overate, the mature ones maintained their former levels of food intake.

<p>"Young animals are still growing, and they have a higher protein requirement than mature  animals," he said. "The young rats may be overeating in calories to get enough protein."

<p>His findings also may shed light on the link between nutrition and obesity in some children.

<p>"This research could have implications in dietary requirements, but it's still too early to tell," he  said.

<p>White is now conducting experiments to test another prediction: Adults may burn excess protein  as fuel instead of using it for growth. If so, the protein would break down into waste products like  ammonia. When ammonia circulates to the brain, it sets off a chain of events that lowers NPY production  in the hypothalamus.

<p><b>The Sugar Link</b>

<p>Glucose levels in the hypothalamus may provide another clue to food intake and obesity. The idea, first  advanced four decades ago by Harvard researcher Jean Mayer, is that the brain regulates stored    energy  and feeding behaviors based on blood sugar levels. But the techniques to test the theory weren't available  until recently.

<p> Martin's team has shown that when animals fast, they use fat for fuel. But when they overeat,  they burn glucose -- a simple sugar. The scientists used a glucose blocker to prevent glucose in the blood  from being used by cells. Even though the blood carried plenty of glucose, the brain was tricked into  perceiving a shortage and responded by producing more NPY, which sent the signal to eat.

<p>"Things like food deprivation and exercise decrease the glucose levels and increase NPY," White  said. "Blocking glucose increases NPY levels. So glucose could be a common thread that leads to increases  in food intake and obesity."

<p>The researchers now suspect that the brain's mechanism for detecting glucose may be very similar  to the way the pancreas detects blood sugar levels.

<p>"This idea ties a lot of information together," Martin said. "We're finding the way the brain senses  glucose could be the same way cells in the pancreas sense glucose. Other labs have shown that other areas  of the brain also have these particular cells, and it turns out these areas may be involved in feeding  behavior."

<p><b>Regulating Food Preference</b>

<p>It might be simpler to understand eating behaviors if the hypothalamus were the only brain region  involved. But that's not the case.

<p>Gaylen Edwards, a UGA professor of physiology and pharmacology, studies the brain stem, the  region at the base of the brain. Unusual things happen to appetite when you manipulate this region. That's  because the brain stem not only influences how much we eat, but also which foods we prefer.

<p>"All the nerves from the stomach, the intestines and the liver first stop in the brain stem," Edwards  said.

<p>When Edwards made tiny lesions to prevent the nerves from continuing their communication, lab  rats altered their diets dramatically and lost weight.

<p> "Up to two hours after surgery, they choose very sweet foods like vanilla wafers and eat enormous  quantities of them. But over a 24-hour period, they switch to a protein-rich diet," he said. "It's a very  dramatic change and we are not sure yet how to interpret that."

<p>But Edwards said he hopes to get a clearer picture from his current studies, which trace the effects  of certain drugs that interfere with specific neurotransmitters. "If we can understand how [brain] systems  function and which neurotransmitters are important, we can then start to work on therapies for obesity that  will be effective," he said.

<p>That's because rats and people are alike in many ways. For example, sometimes rats just can't  resist overeating when abundant supplies of tasty sweet morsels are available, said UGA assistant research  scientist Barbara Grossman.

<p>With funding from the National Institutes of Health, Grossman has shown that rats may become  obese when allowed to feed freely on diets rich in either carbohydrates or fats. Her findings on how fat  consumption influences food selection also may shed light on why some obese   people crave carbohydrates.

<p><b>Taste Isn't an Issue</b>

<p>Grossman carried out several experiments on how fat in the diet affects food preferences. She gave rats of  all ages and both sexes either unsaturated fat (like corn oil) or saturated fat (like vegetable   margarine or tallow) to see which foods they would choose. To avoid the influence of the fat's taste on  food selection, she bypassed some animals' taste buds.

<p>Regardless of age, sex or how they were fed, the results were always the same. Those that  received unsaturated fat chose the high-carbohydrate, low-protein fare; the saturated-fat group preferred  just the opposite: a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet.

<p>"Different types of fat will affect subsequent appetite," she said. "And this can happen within two  hours. It's a very quick response."

<p>Grossman also has studied the liver's role in diet selection. "The liver generates a lot of signals  that influence eating behavior. It's the first organ that receives information from your diet," she said. "Most  of the nutrients you eat go to the liver first to get processed."

<p>She used a chemical to block the lab animals' ability to use fat as a food source. Regardless of  whether the diet contained unsaturated or saturated fat, the rats chose a high-carbohydrate diet. The same  held true when the nerve between the liver and the brain was inactivated, indicating the brain received  feedback from the liver on diet selection and fat consumption.

<p>The nerve carries a "unique signal from saturated fat metabolism [that] induces protein  consumption at the cost of carbohydrates," Grossman said. "Maybe there is some unique difference in  metabolism between saturated and unsaturated fat. I haven't figured that out yet."

<p>Much of the recent obesity research in Martin's lab has piggybacked on the findings of former  UGA scientists and doctoral students like Ruth Harris. Now a research scientist at Pennington Biomedical  Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., Harris showed in the early and mid-1980s that overfed animals are  able to adjust food intake and body weight.

<p> After restricting food intake in normal-weight rats for several days, Harris let them eat their fill.  Not surprisingly, they overate. But they stopped overeating when their weights returned to prerestriction  levels.

<p> "Humans do the same thing after they diet," Martin said. "Ninety-five percent of people who start  a weight-loss program will return to their original weight within five years."

<p>Harris overfed normal-weight rats until they became obese. As their body fat climbed to 30  percent from 10 percent, they gained weight according to a very distinct pattern. But when overfeeding  ceased, the rats reduced their food intake until both their weight and body fat returned to pre-experiment   levels.

<p>"The animals' bodies seemed to  recognize' that they had gained too much weight and too much  body fat, and they reduced their food intake until their body weight was back to normal," Martin said.

<p>In another study, Harris proved that a substance produced by the body and carried in the  bloodstream regulates food intake and reduces body fat. Martin called those experiments "pivotal" in  advancing the understanding of food intake on weight gain and body fat. "It appeared that a circulating   factor was reducing body-fat content by inhibiting fat synthesis rather than by breaking down fat stores,"  he said.

<p><b>Signals of Satiety</b>

<p>In 1953, British scientist Gordon Kennedy proposed that the brain monitors some signal from fat that helps  the body maintain a fairly constant fat percentage. For almost four decades scientists searched  unsuccessfully for a satiety signal from fat cells. Then, in 1989, Marty Hulsey, a doctoral student and now  an assistant research scientist in Martin's lab, conducted experiments that provided evidence for a satiety  signal from fat -- or adipose -- tissue.

<p>Hulsey separated fat into five different categories based on the weight of proteins found in the fat  and discovered that the mid-range proteins inhibited eating and caused weight loss in lab animals. Hulsey  dubbed this potent but unknown appetite inhibitor ASF, or adipose satiety factor.

<p>In later experiments Hulsey showed that ASF even suppresses feeding activity when food intake  has been restricted for two to three days.

<p>"It took almost three days of restricted feeding to overcome the effect of ASF, so it was pretty  powerful," Hulsey said.

<p>"The satiety signal may be an important link in understanding how the body and brain  communicate energy status to maintain a remarkably consistent weight throughout a lifetime," Martin said.  "Such a signal could be a key factor in weight control."

<p>Hulsey cautiously decided not to publish his results until he had determined that the activity was  not just a side effect.

<p>"A pivotal concern with a potential satiety factor is the behavioral specificity of the effect,"  Hulsey said. "Is it suppressing feeding because it's a natural satiety mechanism -- something that makes the  rat feel full -- or is it simply making the rat sick? You can't ask the rat whether it feels ill so you do a taste  aversion test."

<p>Taste aversion -- one of three tests Hulsey applied -- uses a saccharin solution administered with  either ASF or lithium chloride, a chemical that makes rats mildly sick. When rats get sick after drinking the  sweet solution, they won't go near it again. The ASF treatment didn't make them avoid the saccharin,  which meant the weight loss was not a side effect of the experiment.

<p>"We still had a hard time getting the results past the [scientific journal] reviewers," he said. "They  just didn't believe it because people had looked for so many years for something like this, and I was just a  graduate student at the time."

<p>After publishing his results, Hulsey won a highly competitive and prestigious University  Exploratory Research Grant from Proctor and Gamble Inc. to find the active ingredient. But there was a  problem that no one could foresee: The mixture contained more than 80 proteins, a stumbling block for any  scientist with limited resources.

<p>At the same time, scientists at Rockefeller University were doing similar research, except they had  started with a gene and worked their way up to a protein. In November 1994, they announced their  discovery of a mouse gene that made a protein that reduced body fat. Named the "ob" protein, it may hold  another key to understanding genetic obesity.

<p>"We think Marty Hulsey was very close to being the one to discover the ob protein," Martin said.  "ASF suppressed food intake and body weight exactly like the ob protein, but it has many proteins in it and  you don't know which one is the active one."

<p>Martin's team now is preparing to study the ob protein. With help from Ron Makula, director of  the UGA fermentation plant, they're using bacteria to grow large quantities of the ob protein for a variety  of experiments. For example, Hulsey wants to compare it to ASF to see if they are one and the same  protein. White said he believes the ob protein works through a neural transmitter and plans to test its effects  on NPY production. Grossman intends to see if the ob protein acts through the nerve between the liver and  brain to affect appetite and weight.

<p>The entire team of scientists working with Martin on obesity research includes UGA faculty,  research scientists and graduate students from four of the university's 13 colleges as well as a small  complement of investigators at the USDA Richard B. Russell Agricultural Research Center.

<p>Together they take a two-pronged approach to understanding obesity. One group probes the  biological hows and whys of fat cell development (see related story on page 14), while the other studies the  internal mechanisms between the brain and body that determine when, what and how much to eat.

<p>"When I began this research I wanted to understand what causes the body to produce and store fat  in the first place, so that we might be able to control fat and thus reduce the health risks associated with  obesity," Martin said.

<p>   For the more than 80 million Americans who are considered obese, the results of this research may  ultimately be a step in finding ways to live healthier lives.

<br>
The University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc.
</center>
</font>
<P>The University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. (UGARF) was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Georgia as a nonprofit corporation on November 17, 1978.The Board of
Regents of the University System of Georgia have signed a Memorandum of Understanding
which serves to establish the relationship between the two organizations.The following is an
excerpt from the Memorandum of Understanding.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The work of the UGARF in contributing to the functioning of the University in research, development and other fields shall include the securing of gifts, contributions and grants from individuals, industrial or private organizations, governmental agencies or other public agencies and the obtaining of and entering into contracts with such individuals or entities for the
performance of sponsored research, development or other programs to be performed under
subcontract by the University."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The UGARF also supports a variety of programs designed to serve the UGA and enhance its
excellence as a research university.</P>

<A NAME="Grants"><H3>RESEARCH GRANTS AND SUPPORT</H3></A>

<A NAME="FRG"><H4>Faculty Research Grants</H4></A>

<P>The Faculty Research Grants program encourages junior faculty to develop strong programs
of research and creative scholarship.In this sense, grants may be considered "seed money" for
research leading to the growth and development of continuing research programs.</P>

<P>Eligibility for Faculty Research Grants is limited to tenure-track UGA instructors and
assistant professors and to assistant research scientists.Temporary, visiting, adjunct, or
part-time faculty are not eligible, nor are postdoctoral associates.</P>

<P>Only one proposal may be submitted annually by an eligible individual, including proposers
who submit jointly.Proposals may not be submitted by an individual who has an active Faculty
Research Grant. The application deadline for Faculty Research Grants is usually in
November.Application forms and additional information are available from the UGARF,
542-6512.</P>

<A NAME="SFRG"><H4>Senior Faculty Research Grants in the Humanities and Fine Arts</H4></A>

<P>The Senior Faculty Research Grants in the Humanities and Fine Arts program was created
because fewer sources of external research support are available to senior faculty in these
areas.This program is acknowledges that exemplary work in the humanities and fine arts is
important to this University and will increase if there is support to advance and disseminate
knowledge generated by senior faculty members.Furthermore, advancement and dissemination
of such knowledge should be used as a catalyst to increase support from both private and
public sources.</P>

<P>Eligibility for Senior Faculty Research Grants in the Humanities and Fine Arts is limited to
associate and full professors at the UGA.Temporary, visiting, adjunct, or part-time faculty are
not eligible.</P>

<P>Only one proposal may be submitted annually by an eligible individual, including proposers
who submit jointly.Proposals may not be submitted by an individual who has an active Senior
Faculty Research Grant in the Humanities and Fine Arts or an active Faculty Research
Grant.The application deadline is usually in November.Application forms and additional
information are available from the UGARF, 542-6512.</P>

<A NAME="FTS"><H4>Foreign Travel Support</H4></A>

<P>The Foreign Travel Support program provides financial assistance for travel to meetings held
outside the United States.Faculty members, research professionals, postdoctoral associates,
and graduate students are eligible.A faculty committee evaluates requests, giving priority to
the meeting's importance and the significance of the individual's participation. In general,
significant international meetings and congresses will receive higher priority than annual
meetings of membership organizations.Priority will be given to those who present research
papers, performances, or exhibits.For example, a specific invitation to give a plenary lecture
will receive preference over presentation of a paper that is routinely accepted upon
submission.</P>

<P>Awards are limited to one round-trip air fare at the lowest available price to the major
international airport nearest the meeting site.Documentation of participation (letter of
invitation, copy of program, etc.) and endorsement of department head and dean are
required.Normally, some commitment of funds by the department, school or college, research
grant, or (for graduate students) the Graduate School will be expected.</P>

<P>Applications are available from the UGARF, 542-5930, and should be submitted according to
the following schedule:

<A NAME="Awards"><H3>THE RESEARCH AWARDS PROGRAM</H3></A>

<P>The Research Awards Program was established to recognize excellence in research and
scholarly creativity at the University.Awards are given annually to honor outstanding faculty
and graduate students.The awards program is outlined below.For more information, please
contact the UGARF, 542-6512.</P>

<A NAME="RCAMA"><H4>Robert C. Anderson Memorial Award</H4></A>

<P>Recent UGA graduate students are eligible for the Robert C. Anderson Memorial Award.Two
awards of $1,000 each are given, one in the natural sciences and one in another field.The
award is based on originality, creativity, and productivity.Candidates should possess an
outstanding record of research performed while a graduate student and during the period
immediately following receipt of the terminal degree.Criteria include the scope and difficulty
of the research, innovation and independent thought, development of new ideas, techniques,
and methodology, and the significance of the candidate's research.</P>

<P>A nomination is made by submitting a nominee's curriculum vitae; evidence of
accomplishment appropriate to the field; a cover letter from the nominee's major professor;
and three letters of recommendation, one of which must be from an individual outside the
University.Recipients will be selected by a committee appointed by the UGARF, with one
member being appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School.</P>

<A NAME="CRA"><H4>Creative Research Awards</H4></A>

<P>Each year nominations are solicited by the UGARF for Creative Research Awards from all
areas of University research and creative activity.Three awards are given:the Albert
Christ-Janer Award for outstanding contributions in the creative arts and humanities; the
Lamar Dodd Award for outstanding contributions in the sciences; and the William A. Owens
Award for outstanding contributions in the social and behavioral sciences.</P>

<P>Nominations must be based upon an accumulation of outstanding research or creative
activities that have received national and/or international recognition. Nominations may be
made by any group of five faculty members, which may include department heads, deans, and
vice presidents.Nominees must have completed at least five years of service at the UGA.</P>

<P>Specific guidelines on preparing a nomination are available from the UGARF, 542-6512.</P>

<A NAME="CRM"><H4>Creative Research Medals</H4></A>

<P>Each year, faculty are awarded Creative Research Medals based upon a research project or
creative activity with a single coherent theme or identifiable focus of creativity.The principal
thrust of the project must have occurred within the past five years and should be identified
with the UGA.Faculty members, active or emeritus, are eligible and an individual who
receives a medal may be nominated for another medal five or more years after the first
award.Nominations may be made by a department, school, college, or other appropriate unit;
where circumstances dictate, a nomination may be made by a group of faculty members.For
specific format guidelines on submitting a nomination, please contact the UGARF, 542-6512.</P>

<A NAME="IA"><H4>Inventor's Award</H4></A>

<P>The Inventor's Award was established to recognize an inventor's unique and creative
contribution to the University.Members of the UGARF Board of Directors evaluate inventions
and recommend the award based on creativity, innovativeness, and impact on society.</P>

<A NAME="TechTran"><H3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER</H3></A>

<P>The University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. has been designated as the sole entity at The University of Georgia responsible for protecting intellectual properties and for
transferring technology developed through the University's research programs or by
University personnel.Thus, the UGARF has responsibility for protecting and marketing
intellectual property and proprietary information to industry, and for negotiating and
prosecuting license agreements and industry-sponsored research agreements. Individual faculty
do not have such authority.The ongoing objective of the UGARF is to provide services to the
research community and thereby enhance the University's programs and goals as a research
institution.</P>

<A NAME="IP"><H4>Intellectual Property</H4></A>

<P>Intellectual property includes works of authorship and technology such as any writings,
information, or materials eligible for protection under the Patent, Plant Variety Protection,
Copyright, and Trademark laws of the United States.The following is a synopsis of the types
of protection available for works of authorship and technology:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<A NAME="patents"><B>Patents.</B></A> A patent is a grant issued by the United States or foreign jurisdiction giving an inventor or, in some cases, the inventor's assignee or licensee, the right to exclude others from
making, using, or selling the invention within a certain territory for a certain period of
time.Patents generally protect new, useful, and non-obvious compositions, devices, and
processes.

<P>To identify potentially patentable inventions, you should continually review your work in the
context of United States patent law, which states the terms upon which patents may be granted:</P>

<P><I>A process</I>, such as a method of using specific molecules for the diagnosis of viral diseases;</P>

<P><I>A machine</I>, such as a new instrument for the synthesis of oligonucleotides;</P>

<P><I>An article of manufacture</I>, such as an assay kit for an infectious disease or class of diseases;</P>

<P><I>A composition of matter</I>, such as a new molecule (characterized by amino acid or nucleotide
sequence) or a new chemical compound;</P>

<P><I>New and useful improvements</I> of the above;</P>

<P>Any distinct and <I>new variety of plant</I> which is asexually reproduced;</P>

<P>Any new, original, and <I>ornamental design</I> for an article of manufacture;</P>

<P>A <I>novel trait</I> expressed in a living organism (e.g. plants, animals, microorganisms).</P>

<P>If an innovation fits into one of these categories, United States patent law also requires that it
be:</P>

<P><I>New</I> (or novel):The invention must be demonstrably different from any existing prior art. This means it cannot be described in prior "public disclosures," which include research
publications, or be available to the public as a commercial product;</P>

<P><I>Useful:</I> The invention must be useful in ways which represent improvements over existing products or techniques;</P>

<P><I>Non-obvious:</I> The invention cannot be obvious to a person of "ordinary skill" in the art.Non-obviousness usually is demonstrated by showing that practicing the invention yields surprising, unexpected results.</P>

<P>Each of these three criteria is open to interpretation.Establishing novelty or usefulness often
relies on arbitrary value judgements.For example, it may not be clear that a new
gene-sequencing instrument is "demonstrably different" from other existing models, or that the
use of a new hybridoma for narrow research purposes is sufficiently significant to be called a
"useful" improvement over existing techniques.</P>

<P>Despite the possible variety of definitions of novelty and usefulness, the concept of "non-
obviousness" is the most complex of the three and is subject to broad and often inexact
interpretation.For example, it might be argued that a new method of controlling protein
production in bacteria is obvious in the face of prior art because it relies on a collection of
well-known, existing, and proven concepts.Conversely, one could argue that the same method
is not obvious because certain specific elements of the method yield surprising, unexpected
results. Judging what is obvious to one of "ordinary skill" in an art is rarely straightforward,
especially in technologically complex fields.</P>

<P>These three criteria are usually the focal point of the patent office's evaluation of patent
applications, and in particular, "obviousness" is most frequently cited by patent examiners as
the reason an invention is rejected.</P>

<P>Finally, patent law states that inventions may be patented if they have been reduced to
practice, even if a physical embodiment of the invention has not been realized.Therefore, some
extrapolation about an inventive concept can be included in a patent application.The extent of
permissible extrapolation, however, may be the subject of dispute with the patent office.For
example, an invention which claims a broad class of chemical compounds is rarely granted a
patent, unless evidence is presented that several different representative members of the class
have actually been made.A claim even to a single new compound usually must include a
detailed description of its actual synthesis in order to receive patent protection.In the case of
machines or mechanical devices, the requirements of the patent office are much less strict.</P>
<LI>
<A NAME="PVPC"><B>Plant Variety Protection Certificates.</B></A> Sexually propagated cultivars that are distinctive, uniform, and true-breeding can be protected under the Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970.Such certificates provide protection only for the named cultivar.The Act provides a research exemption for the use of the protected cultivar in breeding programs.<BR><BR>
<LI>
<A NAME="copyrights"><B>Copyrights.</B></A>Copyrightable materials are defined in the U.S. Copyright Act as original works of authorship embodied in a tangible, or fixed, medium of expression.Copyrights protect the form of expression of an idea, but not the underlying idea.Books, papers, video tapes, films, music, paintings, and computer software are examples of materials typically subject to copyright protection.

<P>Copyright protection exists from the time the work is created in fixed form; that is, it is an
incident of the process of authorship.While it is not necessary to register a copyright or place a
copyright notice on works to be published, the UGARF recommends that a notice should be
included to protect future commercial interests.The notice should take the following form:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P> _19__, the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. (for works being published); or</P>

<P>Unpublished work _ 19__, the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. (for works
not published but distributed outside of the University).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The copyright owner typically maintains an exclusive right to reproduce the work, prepare
derivative works based on the original work, distribute copies of the work to the public, and
perform and display the work publicly.</P>
<LI>
<A NAME="MW"><B>Mask Works.</B></A> A mask work is a series of related images representing a predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconducting layers of a semiconductor chip product. Under the Semiconductor Chip Act of 1984, mask work protection extends for ten years and gives the owner of the qualifying mask work exclusive rights to its exploitation.Mask works are registered with the United States Copyright Office.Failure to
apply within two years of the initial commercial exploitation results in the termination of the
exclusive rights.<BR><BR>
<LI>
<A NAME="TSM"><B>Trade and Service Marks.</B></A> A trade or service mark is a word, name, symbol, or device (or any combination) adopted by an organization to identify its goods or services and distinguish them from the goods and services of others.The mark is associated with goods or services in commerce.It is possible to register a mark prior to commercialization of the goods or service, but commercialization has to be achieved within acertain time frame.<BR><BR>
<LI>
<A NAME="TRP"><B>Tangible Research Property.</B></A> Tangible research property includes research results in a tangible form, such as integrated circuit chips, computer software, biological organisms, engineering prototypes, engineering drawings, and other property which can be physically distributed.Tangible research property often, but not always, has intellectual property rights associated with it.Tangible research property also may be controlled and protected by
distributing such property in accordance with certain terms and conditions.Such terms and
conditions may be outlined in a contract, agreement, or license.<BR><BR>
<LI>
<A NAME="TSKH"><B>Trade Secret and Know-How.</B></A> Trade secret protection may be available under state law for technical or business information, including formulae, processes, and devices used or usable to achieve a competitive advantage in a trade or business and not publicly available.Trade secrets are seldom held by the UGA.Trade secrets may be retained for a brief period of time for specific purposes, such as to allow for the preservation of rights to file a patent application.

<P>Know-how is often associated with tangible research property.Know-how may include
detailed and specific information regarding how to manipulate specific biological materials or
create and maintain specific devices.Know-how of this nature seldom warrants publication
because of its restricted application.Such know-how may be extremely valuable to licensees or
developers of tangible research property.</P>
</UL>
 <A NAME="OIP"><H4>Ownership of Intellectual Property</H4></A>

 <P>University of Georgia faculty and staff members agree, as a condition of employment, to
abide by the Copyright and Patent Policy of The University of Georgia and the University
System of Georgia.</P>

<P>Rights in patentable technology developed during the course of sponsored research are
determined in accordance with the applicable grant or contract. Therefore, it is important to
analyze each contract or grant with respect to the allocation of patent rights. Most research
performed at the UGA is sponsored by the federal government, which typically allows the
University to elect title to the invention.Rights to patentable technology developed with
industrial support are determined by the contractual arrangement with the sponsor.It is the
policy of the UGARF to retain rights and to grant industrial sponsors an option to acquire a
license to exploit commercially the technology developed during a sponsored research project.</P>

<P>Ownership of inventions developed as a result of assigned University effort resides with the
University. Inventions are considered as having been developed as an assigned duty if
conception or development is in the area of principal competence for which the individual is
employed.</P>

<P>Ownership of inventions generated entirely on personal time and solely as a result of
individual initiative, and not involving the use of University facilities or resources, resides
with the inventor.It is the responsibility of the inventor to demonstrate that such inventions
made, discovered, or developed while the inventor is employed by the University meet these
required criteria.</P>

<P>Rights to copyrightable materials developed as a result of work supported partially or fully by
a sponsor will be determined by the terms of the contract or grant.</P>

<P>Rights to copyrightable materials produced by employees of the University will be assigned to
the UGARF if the University has paid the employee to write or produce the specific
materials.A faculty member's general obligation to produce scholarly and creative works does
not constitute a specific assignment.</P>

<P>Copyrightable materials produced by employees of the University will be the exclusive
property of the employees if no significant use was made of University personnel or facilities
and if the materials were not prepared in accordance with the terms of a contract or grant or as
a specific assignment.</P>

<A NAME="RIP"><H4>Reporting Intellectual Property</H4></A>

<P>The UGA patent policy requires that all inventions made during the course of an inventor's
activities as a University employee be formally reported to the UGARF. The Invention Report
Form, available from the UGARF, must be completed, signed, and returned to the UGARF so
that patenting or other means of protection can be explored.If appropriate, a case for inventor
ownership of the invention should accompany the Invention Report Form.</P>

<P>It is important to submit an Invention Report Form as soon as an inventive concept can be
described fully and precisely, even if a physical embodiment of the idea has not been
realized.If the invention meets patent law requirements and appears to be commercially
attractive, a patent application may be filed before the actual reduction to practice.</P>

<P>In addition to providing a precise description of the invention in the Invention Report, you
should take special care to list all the inventors who made a creative contribution to the
inventive concept. Individuals who carried out work at the direction of those creating the
concept ordinarily should not be designated as inventors.The information provided and
witnessed in the Invention Report forms the legal basis for inventorship and distribution of
royalties.</P>

<P>It is the policy of the University that faculty members must remain free to disseminate the
results of their research as they wish.However, faculty members should be aware that
publication or public disclosure affects patentability.The UGARF staff is available to help
clarify questions in this area.In terms of patent law, the publication or public disclosure of an
invention means the non-confidential transfer of knowledge, orally or in writing, by exhibits,
demonstrations, or public use of the invention which would permit others skilled in the art to
duplicate it without undue experimentation.Abstracts, theses, typewritten papers, and slides or
other materials which are projected, distributed, or discussed at non- confidential meetings,
conferences, seminars, or forums are examples of what may constitute publication or public
disclosure.</P>

<P>The dates of existing or planned publications or presentations that are requested in the
Invention Report are critical in determining the patentability of an invention and the time
frame in which a patent application must be made.In the United States, patent applications may
be filed up to one year after an invention's first public disclosure.In contrast, most foreign
countries require patent applications be filed before any public disclosure of an invention is
made. Further, because most foreign countries have very broad definitions of public
disclosure, even the most casual disclosures of inventions can eliminate the possibility of
patent protection.Despite these strict rules, if a U.S. patent application is filed before any
publication, most foreign countries permit filing of corresponding applications for up to one
year after the U.S. filing date, even if a publication of the invention was made after the U.S.
filing.Therefore, a U.S. patent application filing prior to any publication preserves both U.S.
and foreign patent rights.</P>

<P>If you think you have an invention that may be patentable, please contact the UGARF.After
an Invention Report Form is received, an appointment will be set up to discuss and evaluate
your innovation.The UGARF staff accepts all information on a confidential
basis.Copyrightable materials owned by the University as a result of sponsored research,
specific University assignments, or use of University personnel or resources should be
disclosed to the UGARF.The UGARF staff will work with the author to determine the
appropriate mechanism for further distribution of the work.In many cases the author may
provide the best method of transferring the intellectual property to the public.For example, an
author will negotiate with a publisher to produce a book.In appropriate cases, the UGARF
may waive its ownership rights and assign ownership to the author.</P>

<A NAME="ACO"><H4>Assessing Commercial Opportunities</H4></A>

 <P>Two critical factors determine the attractiveness of an innovative idea to companies capable of developing it into a commercial product:the idea must be protectable, preferably through
broad, valid patents, so that the company developing and marketing it can control its use and
sale for the life of the patent (usually 17 years); and the idea must benefit a segment of society
and appeal to a potential market large enough to justify investment in development,
manufacture, and marketing by a company, whether it is a major multinational company or a
start-up one.The resulting product or process must be profitable.</P>

<P>The UGARF will work with the inventor to assess the commercial potential, and, where
necessary, will consult with other authorities on a confidential basis.</P>

 <A NAME="PIP"><H4>Protection of Intellectual Property</H4></A>

<P>The UGARF staff works with the inventor to decide the most appropriate method of
protecting intellectual property.The UGARF's sole purpose in pursuing such protection is to
facilitate the commercialization of a product, technology, or service.</P>

<P>he Invention Report form is reviewed to determine: the probability that meaningful patent
protection can be achieved; and whether the idea has sufficient commercial appeal to be the
basis of a partnership with a company capable of producing and marketing products or
processes based on the invention.</P>

<P>The ideal situation is one where a company already has been identified and has expressed
interest in licensing the product, technology, or service.The costs for filing and prosecuting a
patent in the United States may range from $7,000 to $15,000.Foreign protection can easily
amount to $50,000.These costs are covered by the UGARF until a license is signed.The costs
involved in patent protection are then reimbursed to the UGARF by the company.However,
the UGARF will initiate patent protection in the absence of an interested commercial partner if
the review is positive.Patents cannot, therefore, be considered in the same mode as
publications, and patents are not pursued simply to improve the content of a curriculum vita.</P>

<P>As part of the review, it is often necessary initially to obtain a patentability opinion.This
assesses whether the invention contains sufficient novelty, use, and non-obviousness and
advises on the type of claims that may be possible.Often a major problem is the prior art that
has been disclosed in earlier publications of the inventor.The opinion includes information on
issued or published patents related to the invention, but unless specifically requested, it does
not address the issue of dominant patents.An invention may be patentable, but it may be
dominated by broader claims of an earlier patent.When an invention is judged to be both
patentable and commercially attractive, a U.S. patent application will be drafted and filed.If
the UGARF decides against seeking patent protection, then the inventor will be offered the
opportunity to file at the individual's own expense, and the invention will be assigned to the
inventor.</P>

<P>The patent application, which is submitted on behalf of the inventor and the UGARF by
outside patent counsel, consists of the following:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>An abstract;</P>

<P>The "specification," a text section which explains the invention's history, describes it in
broad terms, and teaches the public how to make and use it; and</P>

<P>The "claims," which are precise, numbered statements describing exactly what the inventor
claims as the invention.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In approximately six to 18 months, the patent office issues its first "office action" or reply to
the initial patent application.This first office action usually rejects most or all of the inventor's
claims on the grounds of obviousness and cites several references, either issued patents or
scientific papers, to support this contention.The inventor and patent attorney then must argue
that the references do not render the invention obvious.This basic give-and-take continues until
a patent is either granted or denied; the entire process can take anywhere from 18 months to
10 years.</P>

<P>If the U.S. patent application precedes all public disclosure, a decision whether to file for
patent protection outside the United States must be made within one year of the U.S.
filing.Because of the very significant costs involved, the UGARF only pursues foreign
protection if a license has been signed or if there is a good chance of signing a license.</P>

<A NAME="LIP"><H4>Licensing Intellectual Property</H4></A>

<P>The UGARF staff works with the inventor to identify and pursue licensing opportunities.The
inventor is often aware of, familiar with, or in direct contact with the companies most likely to
have an interest in the invention.The UGARF staff has experience in several areas and has
access to databases of corporations, their products, and contact personnel.The UGARF is also
a member of and participant in licensing associations.</P>

<P>Initial communication with potential licensees normally is based on a nonconfidential
summary of the invention. Interested companies are then requested to sign a Confidentiality
Agreement before receiving confidential information, such as the patent application and access
to the inventor for discussion.</P>

<P>The involvement of inventors is encouraged and supported, and is usually essential to
successful licensing.However, inventors should limit their communication with a company
until a Confidentiality Agreement has been signed.</P>

<P>If the short list of potential licensees does not lead to a license, the invention summary will be
made available to an extended list of companies and will be included in listings of available
technology that are more widely distributed.</P>

<P> A License Agreement normally contains:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>A license fee</I>, the value of which relates to the value of the invention and the research cost leading to the invention.Sponsorship of research in the inventor's laboratory by the licensee
may be acceptable as part of the license fee;</P>

<P><I>A running royalty</I> the size of which is dictated by the value of the invention and the type of
margin normal to that particular industry;</P>

<P><I>Reimbursement</I> of past and future patent costs; and</P>

<P><I>Due diligence</I> terms to allow the UGARF to terminate the license if the licensee does not exploit the invention.Terms may include yearly payments during development prior to sale of
the product and minimal royalty payments set at a level to allow development of the product
and the market while dissuading the licensee from just sitting on the invention.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Licensed intellectual property, or the option to license intellectual property, frequently
provides the incentive for a company to sponsor research.A major objective of the UGARF is
to help faculty obtain sponsored research from industry.However, it should be recognized that
sponsorship of research by a company has direct implications on the type of license that can be
subsequently negotiated, such as in the following cases:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The research funding may negate a license fee;</P>

<P>Running royalties, or even a one-time, up-front royalty payment, may not be possible.Some
companies believe that sponsorship justifies company ownership of all resulting
technology.Usually, however, funds provided by the company do not fully cover the costs of
doing the research since faculty salaries are not included and the sponsored project depends on
a substantial body of earlier research that was not supported by the company;</P>

<P>Useful due diligence terms are more difficult to negotiate since some companies may prefer
to sit on technology developed from their sponsorship rather than allow a competitor to license
it.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Certain inventions may be exploited best through the formation of a new company specifically
dedicated to the development and commercialization of the invention. The inventor is usually
the best "champion" of the invention and may wish to commit time, effort, and resources to
commercialization.The UGARF will work with the inventor to discuss the opportunities and
problems and will negotiate a license to the inventor's new company.</P>

<P>Many problems usually occur during the development of a licensed product, and,
unfortunately, the signing of a License Agreement does not complete the technology
transfer.The majority of cases require further sublicensing or relicensing activities.</P>

<A NAME="ID"><H4>Income Distribution</H4></A>

<P>All income generated from the licensing of patents or proprietary information is divided
among the inventor, the sponsoring academic unit, and the UGARF.Income from licenses is
distributed on a quarterly basis as follows:25 percent to the inventors, 10 percent to the
academic unit, 15 percent to the UGARF's operating budget, and 50 percent to a UGARF
restricted account that generates interest to support research programs at the University.</P>

<P>A Memorandum of Understanding between the UGARF and the Georgia Seed Development
Commission states that royalty revenue generated from new plant cultivars is be distributed 25
percent to the inventors, 10 percent to the academic unit, and 65 percent to the Agricultural
Experiment Stations to support research on the development of new plant cultivars.</P>

<P>Copyright ownership may be assigned to the author, who consequently receives any income
generated. Distribution of revenue is decided on a case-by-case basis where copyright remains
with the UGARF because of sponsored support, University-assigned duty, or active UGARF
input.</P>

</font>
</center>
</font>
<p>
The Research Communications Division of the Office of the Vice President for Research writes and disseminates research-related information to the media, the general public, policy makers, the faculty and administrators, and other interested audiences. 
Information is distributed in many ways, including <A href="./rcr_toc.html">Research Reporter</A> magazine and press releases.
<p>
Research Reporter contains stories and news briefs on a broad range of research topics under investigation by University faculty. The magazine tries to maintain a balance in covering the 
breadth of research disciplines at the university.
<p>
With a circulation of 20,000, Research Reporter is also distributed to Georgia public, private and high school libraries. It is available online through the <A href="http://www.uga.edu/">University of Georgia</A> website, and the articles are also distributed on the Georgia Research Line and through CompuServe's Journalism Forum.
<p>
Research-related news releases are written by the staff and are distributed in collaboration with the University's Office of Public Information.
<p>
Faculty are encouraged to contact the Research Communications staff with ideas for research-related news releases and magazine articles. Journalists and other interested parties can also direct queries regarding research to the staff.

<A NAME="PROPOSAL"><CENTER><B>PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT</B></CENTER>
<DL>
<DT><P>A proposal is the mechanism used to apply for external funding for a research project.  It introduces the idea to be investigated, provides relevant background information, identifies the person(s) who will do the work, indicates how the research will be conducted, and lists the costs involved.  When writing proposals one should know the target agency; adhere to the agency's proposal format; and present a clear, concise statement of what is being proposed and how it will be achieved.</P>

<DT><P>The staff of the Division of Sponsored Programs assists investigators with certain aspects of the preparation and submission of research and instruction proposals to external agencies.  Public service proposals are administered through the Office of the Vice President for Services, Division of Public Service Programs, 542-6124.</P>
<DL>
<A NAME="CRP">
<DT><B><CENTER>Criteria of a Research Project</CENTER></B>

<DT><P>Approval of any research project is based upon several criteria specified by the Vice President for Research.</P>

<A NAME="LFS">
<DT><P><CENTER>Locating a Funding Source (Sponsor)</CENTER></P>
<DL>
<A NAME="NCMS">
<DT><P>Nature and Characteristics of Major Sponsors</P>

<DT><P>The success of a proposal depends upon an appropriate match of the proposal focus with a funding source.  This essential fit is best accomplished when the faculty member understands the nature and characteristics of the different kinds of sponsors.</P>
<DL>
<A NAME="GA">
<DT><P>		Government Agencies.  Most proposals to government agencies are unsolicited.  Program areas, guidelines, and specific formats are usually strictly defined.  Proposals require lengthy review times.  On some occasions a preliminary proposal is required.</P>

<A NAME="Found">
<DT><P>		Foundations.  Generally, foundations do not use standard application forms, and their instructions to applicants are often vague. Many philanthropic agencies have adopted a two-stage process: a preliminary proposal which, if positively reviewed, is followed by an invitation to submit a full proposal.  Five primary criteria applied in the evaluation process are: the ability or expertise of the people involved, the significance of the problem, the importance of the solution, the stature of the sponsoring institution, and the costs involved.  All are regarded as important, though foundations differ in the weight they attach to each.  Because most foundations have a small number of staff, personal contacts are difficult to arrange and published information may be difficult to acquire.</P>

<DT><P>		The Office of the Vice President for Development and University Relations is responsible for all private fund raising at the UGA from any source including foundations, corporations, associations, and individuals.  The staff of the Division of Sponsored Programs will routinely notify the Office of the Vice President for Development and University Relations when they learn of an anticipated proposal intended for submission to a foundation.  Faculty should, therefore, contact the Division of Sponsored Programs prior to approaching a foundation with an unsolicited proposal unless a proposal is in response to an advertised research solicitation.</P>

<A NAME="ASC">
<DT><P>		Associations, Societies, and Councils.  Most voluntary organizations have pre-printed, short application forms that are not as technical as applications to federal agencies.  While federal proposals are usually reviewed by a panel of experts, non-federal organizations--such as the American Heart Association or the National Pork Producers Council--often use a heterogeneous review panel composed of civic leaders, professional experts, and staff of the organization.</P>

<A NAME="Industry">
<DT><P>		Industry.  Industrial sponsors of research usually fund projects that have direct and specific benefits to the sponsor.  They typically offer few guidelines or well-defined procedures for proposal development and/or review.  Most, but not all, industrial support is related to product development and testing.  Frequently, contracts with specific "deliverables" and timelines are the funding mechanism.  The Director of the Industrial Interface Program should be contacted, 542-6512, for additional information regarding industrial-sponsored research.</P>
</DL>
</DL>
<A NAME="SIPS">
<DT><P>Strategies for Identifying Potential Sponsors</P>
<DL>
<DT><P>Faculty may call upon the Division of Sponsored Programs staff and their resources to assist in identifying potential sponsors.  Such resources include electronic databases, a library of special publications, and Deadline Alert, a monthly listing of funding opportunities and submission dates published by the Division of Sponsored Programs. </P>

<DT><P>To initiate a search, faculty members should submit a Request for Funding Search form for  to the Division of Sponsored Programs.  A staff member will schedule an appointment with the faculty member to develop jointly a search strategy.  This service is provided without charge. </P>
<DL>
<A NAME="ED">
<DT><P>		Electronic Databases.  SPIN (Sponsored Program Information Network) and DIALOG are the two databases accessed by staff of the Division of Sponsored Programs.  Searches are based on a strategy developed jointly with faculty.  SPIN is updated daily and contains more than 2,500 research funding sources, including government, private, and corporate agencies.  DIALOG offers more than 300 databases in a broad scope of disciplines unequaled by any other source.  The most powerful on-line system of its type, it contains more than 160 million records.</P>

<DT><P>		The NIH Guide and the NSF Bulletin are available through the Division of Sponsored Programs, which serves as a "hub" recipient.  Distribution is available to faculty via electronic mail/BITNET.  The NIH Guide, generally distributed the week before the NIH mails the hard copy to individuals, is an electronic version that includes the Guide, Requests for Application, and indices.  The NSF Bulletin, available several weeks in advance of the hard copy, provides monthly news about NSF programs, deadline dates, publications, meetings, and current program officers' names and telephone numbers.</P>

<DT><P>		FEDIX (Federal Information Exchange) is an on-line information service that links the higher education community and the federal government.  Currently, FEDIX contains information on the Department of Energy (DOE), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Department of Commerce (DOC), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).  </P>

<DT><P>		STIS (Science and Technology Information Systems) is an electronic information dissemination system that provides easy access to NSF publications.  The full text of publications can be searched on-line and copied from the system.  </P>

<DT><P>		The NSF Electronic Bulletin Board facilitates discussion on grants and grants policy among grantees and the NSF.  The bulletin board is used to post notices of interest and it serves as a forum for sponsored research administration.</P>

<DT><P>		FEDIX, STIS, and the NSF Electronic Bulletin Board are directly accessible by faculty.  User guides, available through the Division of Sponsored Programs, provide detailed procedures for accessing and utilizing the systems.  </P>

<A NAME="LR">
<DT><P>		Library Resources.  The Division of Sponsored Programs maintains several publications that are used to identify potential sponsors.  The Federal Register and agency publications, application packets, guidelines, and annual reports are normally on file for reference.  Before calling an agency for information, please check with the Division of Sponsored Programs to learn if documents are already available.  If not, the staff will obtain them upon request.</P>

<A NAME="DA">
<DT><P>		Deadline Alert.  Deadline Alert, issued ten times per year by the Division of Sponsored Programs, projects program funding deadlines over a three-month period.  Copies are mailed to each department for distribution and also are distributed electronically to faculty upon request.  Please contact the Division of Sponsored Programs to be added to this list.  </P>

<A NAME="FP">
<DT><P>		Faculty Profiles.  The research universities in Georgia together with others throughout the rest of the nation participate in the BestNorth America database.  This international, on-line database provides benefits to UGA faculty.  For example, it permits the Division of Sponsored Programs to disseminate specific funding information rapidly to all faculty who indicate an interest in a particular area or topic.  It also provides national visibility for UGA faculty and programs, and serves as an information source for researchers at the UGA and other member institutions who are interested in collaborations, consulting, technology transfer, or specific research services.  University of Georgia faculty may request Division of Sponsored Programs staff to conduct searches to identify faculty, facilities, and programs at other North American universities.</P>

<DT><P>		Listing in the database is voluntary but encouraged.  Faculty may participate by submitting a completed questionnaire to the Division of Sponsored Programs.  Additional information regarding the BestNorth America database is available from the Division of Sponsored Programs.</P>
</DL>
</DL>
<A NAME="IAS">
<DT><P>Initial Approach to Sponsor</P>

<DT><P>Several options are available to determine a sponsor's interest in a project before developing a full proposal.  These include a preliminary proposal, a letter of inquiry, or an agency contact.  Most agency guidelines generally indicate which of these is preferred. </P>

<DT><P>A preliminary proposal defines the problem, methodology, and significance of the project.  It includes a work schedule, vitae of project personnel, and an estimated budget.  The preliminary proposal should be brief (usually no more than five pages).  </P>

<DT><P>A letter of inquiry contains a brief statement of proposed research, the project's relevance to the sponsor, a brief outline of the investigator's qualifications, an estimated timetable, and costs.  </P>

<DT><P>Researchers may contact agency staff to get advice on proposal content and costs.  Preliminary contact with potential sponsors does not require clearance from the University except for  approaches to foundations or corporations.  In these cases, the Division of Sponsored Programs must be informed before any approach so that clearance with the appropriate University offices can be obtained.  Staff in the Division of Sponsored Programs must have an opportunity to review any budget included in an initial approach.  Preliminary discussions are not formal commitments by the investigator, the agency program officer, The University of Georgia, or the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. </P>

<DT><P></P>

<A NAME="EP">
<DT><P><CENTER>Elements of a Proposal</CENTER></P>
<DL>
<A NAME="SVUP">
<DT><P>Solicited Versus Unsolicited Proposals</P>

<DT><P>A solicited proposal is usually submitted in response to a specific work statement from the sponsor.  The RFP (Request for Proposal), RFA (Request for Application), and RFQ (Request for Quotation) are sometimes used by sponsors to solicit proposals for specific research/development projects or to provide specific goods or services.  Faculty interested in responding to an RFP, RFA, or RFQ are encouraged to notify their department head/dean early in the process so that collaborations can be encouraged, if appropriate.</P>

<DT><P>The advertised RFP, RFA, or RFQ presents an abstract of the solicitation.  It includes information on how to obtain specific proposal details, the sponsor's requirements for the research, expectations of performance, the form the agreement will take, and a timetable when reports and/or product(s) are due.  Also included is a "boiler-plate" set of standard terms and conditions and assurances the institution is asked to accept.  Generally, a limited number of "packages" are printed for any solicitation and are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.  Upon request, the Division of Sponsored Programs staff will obtain the detailed solicitation and will assist with the interpretation and completion of the application.</P>

<DT><P>Division of Sponsored Programs staff may seek assistance from agency personnel to clarify questions arising from the notice.  However, agency personnel typically will not answer questions that might produce an unfair advantage in proposal preparation.  </P>

<DT><P>An unsolicited proposal is initiated by the investigator and submitted according to an agency's guidelines for a specific subject area.  The funding arrangement is typically a grant, but may be a contract.</P>

<A NAME="CP">
<DT><P>Contents of a Proposal</P>

<DT><P>Because content and format requirements differ among sponsoring agencies, the following information includes general characteristics of a proposal.  Although this information will be adequate for most sponsors to evaluate a proposal, some agencies, such as the NIH and NSF, require strict adherence to specific formats.</P>

<A NAME="TP">
<DT><P>		<B>Title Page.</B>  The title page contains proposal information in capsule form.  If the sponsor does not prescribe an established format, the Division of Sponsored Programs staff recommends following the sample.</P>

<DT><P>		The proposal's title accentuates the project's most important feature(s).  It should be clear, accurate, and brief because the agency may abbreviate or truncate a long title, which may result in ambiguities.   
	
		The sponsor's name is the agency to which the proposal is being submitted.  Along with the sponsor's name, include a complete address and contact person, if known.</P>

<DT><P>		Research proposals should be submitted in the name of the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc., and instruction proposals in the name of The University of Georgia.  </P>

<DT><P>		The proposed start date and duration should be realistic enough to allow the prospective sponsor sufficient time to evaluate and process the proposal.  A proposed start date of six months after proposal submission is not unrealistic.</P>

<A NAME="TOC">
<DT><P>		<B>Table of Contents.</B>  The table of contents lists the proposal's major sections and the associated page numbers.  Lists of Tables and/or Lists of Figures are included on the contents page. </P>

<A NAME="Abstract">
<DT><P>		<B>Abstract.</B>  The abstract, approximately 200 words in length, describes the major objectives of the proposed research and the strategy that will be used to meet these objectives.  It must be prepared carefully because agency staff often use the abstract to assign the proposal to a specific study section or panel for review.  Frequently, it is the reviewer's first substantive introduction to a proposal and it provides an initial perspective of the key concept(s) and significance of the study.  A good abstract strikes a careful balance between simple and technical language and highlights the key concepts contained in the proposal. It also serves as a concise reminder when the proposal comes up for general discussion prior to a funding decision.  After an award is made, the abstract may be entered into national data banks with key words selected for quotation indices.  Experienced investigators usually write this section last, after other sections of the proposal have been finalized.  </P>

<A NAME="DPR">
<DT><P>		<B>Description of Proposed Research.</B></P>
<DL>
<A NAME="Intro">
<DT><P>		<I>Introduction.</I>  The introduction provides a brief background of the proposed research.  It includes a precise statement of the research problem and the importance and relationship of the research to the sponsor's mission.  This section demonstrates the applicant's familiarity with the problems to be studied, the status of the field, and the investigator's ability to solve the problem(s).  The final paragraph serves as a transition into the next section, Technical Description.</P>

<A NAME="TD">
<DT><P>		<I>Technical Description.</I>  This is the main section of the proposal and contains a statement of previously conducted research (including unpublished preliminary data), the proposed research, the specific plan or design, and the significance of the anticipated results.  </P>

<A NAME="SPW">
<DT><P>		<I>Statement of Past Work.</I>  The discussion of previous work in the field demonstrates the investigator's knowledge and evaluation of the published literature, and the uniqueness and appropriateness of the proposed approach.  More than a bibliography, this section displays the investigator's critical awareness and assessment of other work in the area.  The investigator should comment on inconsistencies and interpret results within a logical, conceptual framework.</P>

<DT><P>		A proposal to continue or renew an existing project also includes a brief report of accomplishments to date.  Remember to reference any technical reports or publications prepared as a result of the research support and include copies of them as an appendix.</P>

<A NAME="OPR">
<DT><P>		<I>Objectives of Proposed Research.</I>  The anticipated results are stated as measurable objectives within a defined time frame.  Where appropriate, divide the research into phases and provide a description of the plans, specific objectives, and time schedules for each.  </P>

<A NAME="Methodology">
<DT><P>		<I>Methodology.</I>  Describe the approach to be used to study the problem and provide enough information to assure reviewers that you have a clear grasp of the techniques and their limitations.  When possible, include references of published articles (particularly if written by principal or co-investigators) that use the same or similar techniques.  Identify any anticipated problems and describe how they will be handled.  Carefully project the time required for the research project and allow enough time for data collection, analysis, and interpretation.  Unrealistic projections or the omission of a time line may lead to criticism of the proposal.  If a time schedule has been included previously, this section should detail operations to be accomplished during each phase.</P>

<A NAME="Significance">
<DT><P>		<I>Significance.</I>  How will the research contribute materially to the body of knowledge in this area and to the mission of the agency?  This section must answer that question and clearly justify the proposed research.  Avoid  generalities and platitudes; be as specific as possible.</P>

<A NAME="DESA">
<DT><P>		<I>Data Evaluation/Statistical Analysis.</I>  Evaluation has evolved as a critical component of many federal proposals.  Researchers are advised to give serious consideration to the evaluation of their research design, processes, and results, and to budget accordingly.  The applicant must describe how the project will be administered, how the data will be analyzed, and how the evaluation/results will be derived, used, and disseminated.  When appropriate, investigators should describe their evaluation process and statistical methods.</P>

<A NAME="References">
<DT><P>		<I>References.</I>   The list of cited references should include the author, title, journal, volume, page number(s), and the publication date.  Each reference is numbered and the corresponding number is inserted at the appropriate place in the text, which eliminates the need for footnotes.</P>

<A NAME="Personnel">
<DT><P>		<B>Personnel.</B>  The names and titles of all key personnel involved in the project, including support persons, are included in an introductory paragraph, unless agency application forms/instructions indicate otherwise.  If these individuals are not identified when the proposal is prepared, list the job titles, percentage of time to be worked, and the number of employees in each category.  Provide biographies of the principals and include the following information:  name, education, experience, publications, and professional affiliations.  If other faculty/experts will serve as consultants on the project, include their names in this section.  Only individuals who have agreed to serve may be listed.  An accompanying letter confirming such willingness is advised.</P>

<A NAME="Budget">
<DT><P>		<B>Budget.</B>  The complexity of the project must be reflected in the budget, i.e., the objectives and methods described in the proposal should drive the budget, not vice versa.</P>

<DT><P>		Although budgets are cost estimates of future research, they must be prepared with care and must provide a detailed breakdown of each proposed cost category.  The estimates, whether based on past experiences or present costs, should include an annual inflation factor for each category.  Budgets are prepared for the entire project period, i.e., for all years of the proposed research, with separate budgets for each year.  A budget summary is included that shows the annual combined costs for each category and the total project cost.  </P>

<DT><P>		If an agency requires cost sharing, the investigator must determine the cost categories that will be involved.  Such a breakdown is not necessary for the NSF because of an institutional cost sharing agreement.  The staff of the Division of Sponsored Programs can assist with these decisions.</P>

<DT><P>		In preparing the budget section, the principal investigator should review thoroughly the sponsor's requirements, comply with the suggested/required format, and understand what items are allowed as direct costs.  Because some sponsors do not send the budget section to the reviewers, the agency may request the budget be separate from the technical description.  Other agencies ask reviewers to evaluate the budgeted direct costs as they relate to the contents of the proposal.  In all cases, however, the investigator should ensure that the proposed research plan supports the requested budget.</P>

<A NAME="DC">
<DT><P>		<I>Direct Costs.</I>  These are costs that can be attributed directly to an individual research grant.</P>
<DL>
<A NAME="SW">
<DT><P>		a.	Salaries and Wages</P>

<DT><P>		The salaries and wages section is one of the most crucial among the various budget categories.  Agency staff want to know each participant's title, name, employment level, annual salary, type of appointment (nine- or twelve-month), and the percentage of effort to be spent on the project.  </P>

<DT><P>		The salaries of tenured and non-tenured faculty members and other University personnel constitute an appropriate direct cost in proportion to the time each expects to spend on the project.  Other personnel services that are purchased on an hourly basis also may be charged.  </P>

<DT><P>		Salaries and wages should reflect accurately the current compensation level of employees.  However, in view of the length of the review process and the duration of the project, future salary increases should be built into the budget.  An investigator who fails to anticipate such needs may be underfunded if the grant is awarded.  This would require either a reallocation of funds within the approved cost categories or a supplementary request to the funding agency, which may not be approved.  Finally, investigators on an academic-year contract are reminded that summer salaries are projected at the rate of their academic-year salary for the full summer.  The NSF, however, will only approve two summer months per year or two-ninths of the academic-year salary.</P>

<DT><P>		Faculty and staff members, regardless of appointment, may not be reimbursed for more than 100 percent of effort in any given time period.  Furthermore, the NIH has an annual salary cap of $125,000 per individual for an allowable direct cost salary charge.  </P>

<DT><P>		Grant funds may not be used to augment the total salary or rate of pay of faculty or staff.  Grant funds are replacement funds and are used to release a percentage of the employee's time to work on the project.  Salaries charged against grants must follow a scale consistent with University policies and practices.  Faculty may obtain guidance on pay levels, job categories, and/or employment policies by calling the Office of Human Resources, 542-2621, and/or the Division of Sponsored Programs, 542-5939.</P>

<A NAME="FB">
<DT><P>		b.	Fringe Benefits</P>

<DT><P>		Fringe benefits reflect the University's contribution to Social Security, retirement, and insurance programs.  These costs are computed in the budget of the proposal as estimated percentages of the total direct salaries and wages; however, the funded project will be charged for the actual costs of the benefits, which may vary from these estimates.</P>

<A NAME="Consultants">
<DT><P>		c.	Consultants  </P>

<DT><P>		Compensations for services of outside experts who are consulted for specific tasks of short duration are usually made in a single payment.  If the services are required repeatedly during the project, the consultant should be paid as a University employee, and the estimated cost of the services should be included under the salaries and wages category.  If a University of Georgia faculty member is needed as a consultant, it is necessary to budget the colleague's fee to the specific project account (to cover the percentage of his/her salary required for the project) or request that the service be provided as a professional courtesy in the form of cost sharing.  Remember, a University employee cannot be compensated for more than 100 percent of effort.  Some federal agencies limit reimbursement for consultants to the equivalent rates for government-service (GS) level personnel.  The current GS amounts are available from the Department of Contracts and Grants, 542-3721.</P>

<DT><P>		The use of paid consultants must be justified carefully, and investigators are advised to explain in the budget narrative that the required expertise either does not exist on campus or is not easily available.  The budget explanation also states the time period for which the consultant will serve.  Please refer to the University Policy Statement and Procedures for Paying Consultants. </P>

<A NAME="Equipment">
<DT><P>		d.	Equipment</P>

<DT><P>		The U.S. Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions, defines permanent equipment as personal property that has an acquisition cost of $500 or more and a useful life expectancy of more than two years.  The cost of permanent equipment must be itemized and a justification of need must be provided in the budget narrative.  Identify each item by name, type, and manufacturer, when possible.  An extensive list may be itemized on a separate sheet that includes catalog and model numbers.  The aggregate equipment cost is then referenced in the proposed budget.  Some agencies require price references and detailed stock numbers from catalogs, especially for contractual agreements.  Usually, government agencies will not approve the purchase of general office equipment or furnishings, such as calculators, typewriters, desks, chairs, copy machines, or air conditioners, even if they are to be used in a laboratory.  Many agencies will make approval for equipment purchases dependent on what is readily available at the University.  Therefore, it must be emphasized that this category needs careful justification.  Freight and installation charges billed on the same invoice as the equipment can be included in the acquisition cost.  However, maintenance or service contracts are listed in the direct cost category "Other" because they are considered expense items and not equipment costs.  Further information defining UGA equipment criteria can be found in Section 41.2 of The University of Georgia Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual.</P>

<A NAME="EES">
<DT><P>		e.	Expendable Equipment and Supplies</P>

<DT><P>		Even though costs of expendable items used in research are estimates, it is advisable to list categories in excess of $1,000 by general classification, because substantial amounts are frequently challenged by reviewers.  Examples of general classifications include chemicals, glassware, animals (purchase costs, not maintenance), etc.</P>

<A NAME="AR">
<DT><P>		f.	Alterations/Renovations</P>

<DT><P>		The University's Physical Plant Division can provide cost estimates for laboratory alterations and renovations required for a specific project.  Because funds for alterations/renovations are usually difficult to obtain, special care should be given to their justification.</P>

<A NAME="TS">
<DT><P>		g.	Travel and Subsistence</P>

<DT><P>		Domestic travel is requested on the basis of estimated expenses for lodging, meals, and round-trip economy air fare.  The budget must justify the purpose, destination, and dates of domestic travel.  Trips to the contractor's facility or appropriate scientific meetings should be included.   Foreign travel requests must specify the destination and are listed separately from domestic travel.  When travel is extensive, details are itemized on a separate sheet. </P>

<DT><P>		University rates used to determine the cost of travel and specific guidelines are available from the Expenditure Control Department, 542-5735.</P>

<A NAME="PC">
<DT><P>		h.	Publication Costs</P>

<DT><P>		Investigators may budget the anticipated costs of publishing the results of sponsored research, including the costs of reprints, page charges, and illustration costs, if required.  However, on federal grants, this budget category may not include charges for publication of books, monographs, or pamphlets, or costs for promotion, distribution, and general handling of materials.  These costs require special agency approval.  Costs for services performed prior to printing (typing, editing, etc.) are not considered publication costs and are budgeted in the "Other Cost" category.  </P>

<A NAME="STPC">
<DT><P>		i.	Subrecipient or Third-Party Costs</P>

<DT><P>		When a substantial portion of the research program is to be carried out by a third party outside the UGA, the total required dollar amount is entered as a single-line direct cost item in the budget.  These costs include direct as well as indirect costs of the subrecipient.  
		The indirect costs charged by the UGA on the subrecipient portion of the grant are limited to the first $25,000 of the total subrecipient budget over the lifetime of the grant/contract. The need for a subrecipient arrangement must be justified in the narrative.  In addition, the subrecipient should indicate in writing the intent, capability, and willingness to provide the research services.  </P>

<DT><P>		When an award is made, the Division of Sponsored Programs staff will develop and execute the necessary subaward to the associated institution.  Faculty are reminded that they, as individuals, may not enter into written agreements such as subawards.</P>

<A NAME="TC">
<DT><P>		j.	Training Costs  </P>

<DT><P>		This category may include fees, tuition, trainee travel costs, and stipends.  Some programs allocate a set amount allowable per trainee.  Additional information will be found in program announcements specific to the particular agency.  Staff of the Division of Sponsored Programs can assist in defining allowable costs.</P>

<A NAME="ODC">
<DT><P>		k.	Other Direct Costs</P>

<DT><P>		Other direct costs may include costs for pre-printing publications, animal maintenance, payment of volunteers in approved studies using human subjects, shop charges, service contracts, computer charges, graphic arts and photographic services, equipment rental, etc.  Indicate separately the costs in each category and justify any excessive costs that may appear.  </P>

<A NAME="CS">
<DT><P>		l.	Cost Sharing</P>

<DT><P>		Under federal statutes no sponsored grant or cooperative agreement may be supported solely by federal funds.  The recipient organization must share in the cost, even if it's only a small amount.  Some faculty feel their proposals stand a better chance of funding when the University cost sharing is increased.  Agency representatives, however, contend that the strength of a proposal and the cost effectiveness of the budget are the most important qualifications for success.  Cost sharing in excess of stated agency requirements is not advised.  Unnecessary voluntary cost sharing leads to a lower federally negotiated indirect cost rate.  Consequently, the University not only subsidizes the project directly in the form of cost sharing, but it is unable to recover all of the legitimate indirect costs.</P>
</DL>
<A NAME="IC">
<DT><P>		<I>Indirect Costs.</I>  Indirect costs are, in effect, unallocated overhead.  They include costs that have been incurred for common or joint objectives of a university and the research effort housed at its facilities.  Such costs are legitimate and cannot always be identified readily and uniquely with a particular sponsored project or institutional activity.  Examples include utilities, facilities maintenance, and libraries.</P>

<DT><P>		The U.S. Office of Management and Budget publishes Cost Principles for Educational Institutions (Circular A-21), which provides to colleges, universities, and federal agencies the principles for determining the costs applicable to research and other work performed under federally sponsored agreements.  Calculations are based on actual costs incurred for the previous fiscal year.  The University of Georgia indirect cost rate is among the lowest for comparable research universities nationally.</P>

<DT><P>		The University of Georgia is pleased to receive gifts to supplement various programs, but it is inappropriate to accept research projects in the form of a gift when support actually should be in the form of a grant or contract.  The purpose of a gift is not to avoid indirect costs payments. Sponsors providing a gift relinquish direction of the program, access to the results (other than those published or otherwise disseminated in the course of the program activity), and rights to intellectual property that may result.</P>

<DT><P>		The UGA policy regarding recovery of indirect costs and gifts versus grants/contracts is reiterated in a memorandum from President Knapp dated March 10, 1992.</P>

<A NAME="FS">
<DT><P>		<B>Facilities Statement.</B>  The facilities that will be used in the proposed research are described in this section.  The application guidelines may require information about the size of the University and a profile of faculty/students or University-wide facilities such as libraries, computer center(s), and specialized instrumentation resources.  It is important to emphasize unique facilities that strengthen or are critical to the proposed research.  Staff in the Division of Sponsored Programs can provide standard information on University facilities.</P>

<A NAME="CA">
<DT><P>		<B>Compliance Assurances.</B>  Research proposals that involve the use of animals, human participants, biohazardous materials (i.e., infectious or venomous agents), or recombinant DNA must receive approval from the appropriate University division to assure compliance with applicable federal, state, and University policies and procedures.  In some cases, federal agencies require approval prior to the review of a proposal; however, in no case will an award be accepted by the UGA without appropriate approvals.  For more information on Animal Care and Use, see page IV-1.  For more information on Human Subjects/Institutional Review Board, see page IV-4.  For more information on biosafety compliances, see page IV-2.</P>

<A NAME="Dissemination">
<DT><P>		<B>Dissemination.</B>  Many agencies emphasize the need for well-planned dissemination of results to maximize the benefit of funded research.  Most investigators plan to publish research findings in refereed journals.  If other (or additional) strategies seem useful, list them in the proposal's dissemination section.  Examples might include conferences, training workshops, special newsletters, manuals, reports, audio-visual materials, or any other means of sharing research data with the research and/or technological communities.</P>

<A NAME="Appendices">
<DT><P>		<B>Appendices.</B>  Appendices present non-essential supporting documentation or detailed calculations that add important background information.  They also may provide descriptions of available facilities and/or organizations or list individuals who will contribute to the research.  Copies of relevant reprints or technical papers of the applicant are also included as an appendix.  Any letters of support from organizations or individuals that agree to participate in the project or that may benefit from the results of the project form a separate appendix.  Each appendix forms a complete unit, is paginated separately, and is listed in the Table of Contents.</P>

<A NAME="ARD">
<DT><P>		<B>Additional Required Documentation.</B></P>

<A NAME="OSCPS">
<DT><P>		<I>Other Support/Current and Pending Support.</I>  Federal agencies use information listed in this section to identify all other resources or funds that are intended to support the research program of the principal investigator or other key personnel.  This information is used to identify potential overlap in research projects or funding, to assure availability of necessary resources for the project, to identify the committed effort for key personnel, and to identify potential conflicts of interest.  The NIH and NSF use a specific form/format for reporting this information for each of the key personnel.</P>

<DT><P>		Faculty are usually asked to identify the funding source, the title of the project, the total requested and/or received funding amount, the project period, and the percentage of effort of involvement.  Incomplete, inaccurate, or ambiguous information about "Other Support" could lead to significant delays in the review and/or possible funding of the application.</P>

<A NAME="EI">
<DT><P>		<I>Ethnic Information.</I>  Most major agencies require information (for statistical purposes only) about an investigator's ethnicity.  </P>

<A NAME="PI">
<DT><P>		<I>Program Income.</I>  Federal agencies require the identification of anticipated program income during the period(s) for which grant support is requested.  Program income is the gross income earned by the grantee from activities supported in whole or in part by the grant.  For example, it may include income in the form of fees for services performed, proceeds from the sale of equipment or property, usage or rental fees, patent and copyright royalties, etc.  Gifts and financial assistance are not considered program income nor are government revenues such as taxes, fines, penalties, special assessments, or levies unless they are specifically earmarked by the terms of the grant.  The terms of the grant should specify how such income may be spent.</P>
</DL>
</DL>
<A NAME="PROCESS">
<DT><P><B><CENTER>ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSING OF PROPOSALS</CENTER></B></P>

<DT><P>The staff in the Division of Sponsored Programs provides assistance to the principal investigator or program director in preparing and assembling the proposal, particularly in budget preparation.  Requirements of the University and the granting agency are verified and the necessary official institutional endorsements are secured. It is strongly suggested that proposals be submitted to the Division of Sponsored Programs seven to 10 working days prior to the grant deadline.</P>

<DT><P>The Division of Sponsored Programs recommends that the budget be reviewed by one of its staff before the final typing.  The Grants Officer coordinates any necessary changes with the appropriate faculty member and corrections are made only with the researcher's concurrence.  </P>

<DT><P>Any proposal submitted to a sponsor carries a University commitment to complete the project, if awarded, according to the specified terms and conditions. This commitment can only be made by an authorized representative of the University.  The signature of the authorized official certifies that the UGA will assume institutional responsibility for the project pending successful completion of negotiations with the sponsor.  The Vice President for Research is the official authorized to sign research proposals submitted in the name of The University of Georgia.  The Director of Sponsored Programs is authorized to sign instruction proposals in the name of The University of Georgia.  Proposals submitted in the name of the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. must be authorized by the Executive Vice President of the UGARF.  The University's policy requires that, with certain limited exceptions, all research proposals be submitted through the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc.  </P>

<A NAME="PTS">
<DT><P>Proposal Transmittal Sheet</P>

<DT><P>The Proposal Transmittal Sheet is an internal document that initiates the official record of the proposal and establishes administrative tracking within the University, specifically within the Division of Sponsored Programs.  It assures that required approvals are obtained prior to the final institutional approval of the proposal.  The Proposal Transmittal Sheet includes pertinent technical data, compliance clearance, and budgetary information as well as the appropriate administrative certifications.  The information also is used for negotiations with the sponsor and for future institutional administration of the proposed project.  </P>

<DT><P>The principal investigator is responsible for filling out the Proposal Transmittal Sheet, which must be completed before the proposal is submitted to the Division of Sponsored Programs for final approval.  By signing the Proposal Transmittal Sheet the principal investigator certifies that the information on the form is accurate and that, when the project is funded, he/she agrees to assume principal responsibility for carrying out the conditions of the award.  The signature of the department head confirms and guarantees that adequate space, faculty time, and equipment are available, that the proposal is technically sound, and that the principal investigator is competent and capable of carrying out the proposed project.  The dean's signature is usually required in all schools and colleges except the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences.  Some colleges and schools require additional approvals.  Obtaining these approvals is the responsibility of the investigator, who should consult with the appropriate department head(s) and dean(s) to determine that all college/school requirements are met.  </P>

<DT><P>Proposals are not forwarded to the sponsor until the form is completed.  The principal investigator must also provide two copies of the proposal including the cover page, abstract, budget, budget justification, matching funds commitment documentation, and technical section to the Division of Sponsored Programs.</P>

<DT><P>Copies of the Proposal Transmittal Sheet are available from the Division of Sponsored Programs or departmental offices.</P>

<A NAME="IP">
<DT><P>Interdisciplinary Proposals</P>

<DT><P>The current aim of many federal programs is to promote interdisciplinary approaches to specific research and/or program objectives.  Since such projects depend upon cooperation across University administrative lines, the approval of all named investigators, department heads, and deans/directors involved are required.  In the event that an investigator becomes unable to complete his/her share of a project, it is the responsibility of the appropriate department head to find a replacement to fulfill the department's obligations.  When an interdisciplinary project is being planned, it is advisable to discuss the project with all involved department heads and deans early in the process to avoid delays later on.</P>

<A NAME="CM">
<DT><P>Copying and Mailing</P>

<DT><P>These are the responsibility of the department.</P>

<A NAME="SMS">
<DT><P>Submission to Multiple Sponsors</P>

<DT><P>It is legitimate to submit the same research or training project simultaneously to several different funding agencies, provided the guidelines of each funding agency permit such action.  An exception is the NSF's Directorate for Biological Sciences, which prohibits applicants from submitting the same proposal to other federal agencies until the NSF declines to fund the proposal.  The Directorate makes one exception for "beginning investigators," who are allowed to submit similar proposals to as many places as they wish in order to help launch their independent research careers.  Beginning investigators should contact the NSF's Directorate for further information on how to take advantage of this exemption.</P>

<DT><P>Whenever faculty decide to send one proposal to two or more funding sources, they should acknowledge this in their proposal.  Should both agencies decide to fund the project, the researcher must decide which one to accept.  The same project may not receive dual source funding, nor are faculty allowed to charge or cost share more than 100 percent of the total time of their various projects.  It is possible to split funding for various aspects or phases of one project and obtain funds from a combined number of sources.</P>

<A NAME="AWARDS">
<DT><P><B><CENTER>ADMINISTRATION OF AWARDS</CENTER></B></P>

<A NAME="NA">
<DT><P><CENTER>Notification of an Award</CENTER></P>

<DT><P>Once a sponsor agrees to fund a proposal, the sponsor forwards a "notice of award" to the Division of Sponsored Programs and, occasionally, to the principal investigator.  When a notice is received, the Division of Sponsored Programs confirms acceptance (when required) and mails copies of the notification to the appropriate unit(s), the principal investigator, and the Department of Contracts and Grants.</P>

<DT><P>If the specific research is to be performed as a contract rather than a grant, the sponsor may send the research agreement to the UGARF and/or the Division of Sponsored Programs.  Changes desired by the principal investigator, the UGARF, or the UGA are negotiated by the appropriate administrator with the sponsor prior to executing the contract.  Occasionally, the sponsor may inadvertently forward the research agreement to the principal investigator.  In those cases, the principal investigator should forward the documents to the Division of Sponsored Programs for appropriate action.  The principal investigator does not have signatory authority on behalf of the University or the UGARF and, therefore, should not sign or return the documents to the sponsor.</P>

<DT><P>Pharmaceutical firms and other industrial firms may sponsor projects without requiring a formal research proposal.  In these cases, the principal investigator must supply specific project information to the Division of Sponsored Programs so that a University account can be established.  These include:  a copy of the sponsor's letter, notice of award, agreement and/or check together with any pertinent correspondence; a description of the activities to be funded; and a detailed, itemized budget.  As discussed previously, awards of this type do not carry an automatic exemption of indirect costs.  As a general rule, any agreements with such sponsors must use the UGARF research agreement in order to protect the investigator's right to publish, to clarify the rights to intellectual property, and to facilitate the details of the financial transaction.  Investigators who desire more information on this issue may contact the Division of Sponsored Programs, 542-5939.</P>

<DT><P>The Director of the Division of Sponsored Programs is responsible for coordinating the negotiation of research awards, extensions, and terminations.  Any changes resulting from the negotiation will be discussed with both the principal investigator and the Department of Contracts and Grants.  </P>

<DT><P>All sponsors should be informed that checks in payment of UGARF-administered grants and contracts must be made payable to the UGARF and forwarded to the Department of Contracts and Grants.</P>

<A NAME="EUA">
<DT><P><CENTER>Establishing a University Account</CENTER></P>

<DT><P>A "notice of award" is used to establish a separate University account for the intended purpose of the award. The Division of Sponsored Programs furnishes the necessary grant/contract information to the Department of Contracts and Grants, which creates a new University account name and number.  Before the Department of Contracts and Grants is notified, the Division of Sponsored Programs verifies that all information is correct and that all necessary compliances and/or assurances have been obtained.  The Department of Contracts and Grants notifies the principal investigator of the assigned account number and issues the first budget amendment that releases the appropriate spending authority. </P>

<A NAME="GCA">
<DT><P><CENTER>Grant/Contract Administration</CENTER></P>

<DT><P>Primary responsibility for administrating and managing research grants and contracts rests with the principal investigator and his/her department, the Division of Sponsored Programs, and the Department of Contracts and Grants. The responsibilities are described below.</P>

<A NAME="RPID">
<DT><P>Responsibilities of the Principal Investigator/Department </P>

<DT><P>The principal investigator and the UGARF/UGA jointly bear responsibility for proper grant/contract administration according to pertinent policies and guidelines.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to implement actions according to these guidelines, assemble the necessary staff, expend funds appropriately, submit the necessary technical reports, and conduct the project as described in the proposal and agreed to by the award notification.  Faculty who fail to submit timely technical reports jeopardize their future funding, the collection of legitimate grant-related expenses, and University-wide funding with all federal agencies.  Although there is some similarity among the regulations of major funding agencies, principal investigators should be thoroughly familiar with agency regulations applicable for each project under their authority.</P>

<DT><P>The principal investigator may authorize changes in the project budget only when such changes comply with the agency's cost principles and when the desired goods and/or services are directly related to the sponsored project.  Expenditures for salaries and wages may be authorized by the investigator only if they directly benefit the project within the budget period defined in the award. Requisitions for equipment or supplies will be reviewed carefully by grant accountants and may be rejected.  For example, if they are submitted so near the end of the project they cannot reasonably benefit the project or if the items were not listed in the original budget, they may be rejected.  The principal investigator/department is responsible for adequately documenting all cost sharing as required.
 
The principal investigator must direct the technical aspects of the project to ensure completion within the budgeted time and authorized funds.  Alternatively, the investigator must formally request the agency to provide either supplemental funds or a no-cost time extension to allow the work to be completed. </P>

<A NAME="RDSP">
<DT><P>Responsibilities of the Division of Sponsored Programs</P>

<DT><P>The Division of Sponsored Programs is responsible for the non-financial program administration of external contracts and grants for research or instruction. This includes:  forwarding copies of all award documents to the Department of Contracts and Grants; ensuring that appropriate contract clauses and provisions of the original award are included in subcontracts as well as identifying the need to complete formal subcontracting plans; securing audits (with the assistance of the departments involved) from the intended recipients of subawards and forwarding the audit to the Department of Contracts and Grants prior to issuing the sub-agreement; securing appropriate nonfinancial close-out documentation; ensuring technical and other program reports are filed on time; and ensuring that the investigator has obtained all required assurances (animal care and use, human subjects, and/or biosafety).</P>

<A NAME="RDCG">
<DT><P>Responsibilities of the Department of Contracts and Grants</P>

<DT><P>The Department of Contracts and Grants is responsible for informing the principal investigator about expenditures and encumbrances for each sponsored project throughout the budget period and for providing the annual and final fiscal reports required by specific funding agencies.  </P>

<DT><P>Project status reports are issued to principal investigators each month.  A separate report is issued for each account showing the amount budgeted, expended, encumbered, and the unencumbered balance for each budget category.    
	
The Department's responsibility includes financial administration of all external grants and contracts.  Specific responsibilities include:  assigning account numbers to all awards after fiscal review of award documentation; budgeting as awarded; preparing all financial reports, including property reports where property was purchased by the UGA, the UGARF, or recipients of subawards; preparing and submitting all invoices to sponsors; ensuring that all documented cost sharing is reported to sponsor(s); ensuring that all rebudgeting is within local authority or that the appropriate department has received sponsor's approval in writing; reviewing and approving/disallowing all subrecipient audits received from the department and/or the Division of Sponsored Programs and notifying the latter of the decision; securing the appropriate property reports from recipients of subawards; coordinating the response to any financial audits of contract and grant accounts; providing the appropriate financial contract clauses and provisions of the original award to the Vice Presidents for Research and/or Services to be included in purchase orders, check requests, and consulting agreements; maintaining an accounts receivable system and monitoring cash flow of each restricted account; establishing policies and procedures to ensure that the University complies with the financial terms and conditions imposed by sponsoring agencies; calculating and recovering all legitimate indirect costs; and approving all consulting agreements and monitoring the rate of compensation to ensure compliance with federal regulations.</P>

<A NAME="IAAR">
<DT><P><CENTER>Issues Associated with Administration of Research</P>
<DT><P>Grants/Contracts</CENTER></P>
<DL>
<A NAME="CBPP">
<DT><P>Changes in Budget or Project Period</P>

<DT><P>Principal investigators must have prior approval to rebudget funds between or among certain cost categories in a sponsored project budget.  All budget changes must be justified based on the requirements of the project and must be allowable under the conditions of the award.  The University of Georgia has been granted expanded authority (Prior Approval System, or PAS) by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to implement approval of many changes.  PAS allows approval of certain changes for NASA, NIH, NSF, USDA (CSRS), USDC (NOAA) and USDOE (DOE) awards.  PAS review and approval is not required for actions that are included in the proposal and that are either approved by the granting agency or otherwise delegated to the principal investigator by the awarding agency.</P>

<DT><P>The principal investigator initiates the request.  After the appropriate dean(s) and department head(s) agree the form is forwarded to the Division of Sponsored Programs.  The Division of Sponsored Programs reviews the request and transmits it to the Department of Contracts and Grants for final approval and department notification.</P>

<DT><P>Under PAS approval the federal agencies listed above permit pre-award expenditures up to 90 days before the effective date.  Because there is a risk associated with committing funds before an official award notification is received, the principal investigator's department must certify that any costs incurred will be covered by the department if the award is not made.</P>

<DT><P>Occasionally, extensions that carry no additional increase in funding are required to complete a project.  Many agencies allow extensions of one year to be handled by the PAS process.  Most sponsors ask that requests for extensions be submitted at least 45 days before the original budget period is terminated.  Such no-cost extensions require the same endorsements as the proposal originally forwarded to the agency.</P>

<DT><P>Other federal, state, or private funding agencies have a variety of administrative regulations governing rebudgeting.  Faculty may call the Division of Sponsored Programs for information.</P>

<A NAME="OEGCF">
<DT><P>Over-Expenditures of Grant/Contract Funds</P>

<DT><P>Principal investigators have the primary responsibility for managing expenditures within the fiscal regulations and amounts specified by the sponsor.  The principal investigator is responsible for carefully analyzing the monthly status reports to ensure that all items are correct, that none are absent, and that adequate funds remain to complete the project. </P>

<DT><P>Any over-expenditure of funds, whether it be by audit disallowance or otherwise, is the responsibility of the appropriate department or unit.   </P>

<A NAME="RCT">
<DT><P>Retroactive Cost Transfers (Journal Vouchers) </P>

<DT><P>Cost transfer is a process that allows an expenditure that was improperly charged to a sponsored project account to be transferred to the correct account.</P>

<DT><P>Federal regulations (OMB Circular A-21) define improper cost transfers as follows:  </P>

<DT><P><BLOCKQUOTE>	"Any costs allowable to a particular research agreement under the standards provided in this circular may not be shifted to other research agreements in order to meet deficiencies caused by overruns or other fund considerations, to avoid restrictions imposed by law or by terms of the research agreement, or for other reasons of inconvenience."</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<DT><P>Costs, therefore, may not be transferred between unrelated sponsored projects.  They are allowable only between departmental accounts and sponsored project accounts to correct errors in the latter.  A cost transfer is not permitted for the purposes of utilizing unexpended funds, avoiding an over-expenditure, or circumventing award restrictions.  All cost transfers should be processed within 90 days of the original expenditures.</P>

<DT><P>Proper cost transfers must be executed on the appropriate form, with a detailed explanation of the nature of the error and why it occurred.</P>

<DT><P>The principal investigator is responsible for the accuracy and timeliness of all cost transfers.  Additional information can be found in Section 21.3 of The University of Georgia Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual. </P>
</DL>
<A NAME="TE">
<DT><P>Transfer of Equipment</P>

<DT><P>A faculty member who accepts an appointment at another university may wish to transfer research equipment purchased with sponsored project funds.  A form is available from the Division of Sponsored Programs for this purpose.  The completed form will be forwarded to Property Control for verification.  The Vice President for Research can approve transfer or loan of equipment items purchased solely with grant funds.  After the request is approved, the principal investigator may make the necessary shipping arrangements.  Research equipment that was purchased in whole or in part with state funds may not be loaned or transferred.  Additional information can be found in Section 41.2 of The University of Georgia Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual, as well as a policy statement from the Vice President for Research dated February 8, 1988.</P>

<A NAME="CPI">
<DT><P>Change of Principal Investigator</P>

<DT><P>It is important for a principal investigator to realize that even though he/she developed the proposal, the resulting award is made to the UGARF (or the UGA) and not to the individual.  If a principal investigator leaves the University, either permanently or for a sabbatical, the research funded by the grant or contract may continue at The University of Georgia.  If a department wishes to retain an award under new leadership, such a transfer of responsibility must be coordinated with the Division of Sponsored Programs well in advance of the projected transfer date.  The department head, in conjunction with the original principal investigator, should draft a letter to the sponsor regarding the proposed change.  The letter should explain the situation, identify the investigator or former co-investigator who is to be designated as the new director of the project, highlight his/her qualifications to assure continuance of the research as originally approved, and attach the new director's curriculum vitae.  This document is forwarded to the Division of Sponsored Programs for the appropriate authorized institutional signature(s) and then to the agency.  Depending on the project period and the time period of the proposed change, the agency may either issue a new award letter or merely confirm its agreement in writing.</P>

<A NAME="CHI">
<DT><P>Change of Host Institution</P>

<DT><P>Principal investigators who leave The University of Georgia may wish to transfer their research grant(s) to a new institution.  They should notify the Division of Sponsored Programs of their relocation plans and request proper forms and instructions to effect the transfer.  It should be noted that training grants are not transferable. </P>

<DT><P>Similarly, faculty accepting a position at The University of Georgia and wishing to transfer an active grant to the UGA should contact the Division of Sponsored Programs for assistance.

<CENTER><P>ORGANIZATION, RESPONSIBILITY, AND ADMINISTRATION</P></CENTER>

<P>The principal executive officer of research programs at the UGA is the Vice President for Research, who coordinates the activities, organizations, and personnel related to research.  This individual is responsible for the overall research program of the University, including components in departments, schools, and colleges as well as units more specifically dedicated to research, such as the agricultural and veterinary medicine experiment stations and research institutes and centers.  The Vice President administers the sponsored research programs, approving all research proposals submitted to external agencies, and oversees the conduct of programs supported by grants and contracts.  The Vice President is also responsible for technology transfer, patents, copyrights, trademarks, plant variety protection certificates, animal care and use, biosafety, research involving human subjects, and research communications.</P>  

<P>In carrying out these responsibilities, the Vice President is assisted by a staff who deals with various aspects of University-wide research administration and by the directors of the cross-disciplinary centers and institutes.</P>
<A NAME="DSP">
<CENTER><P>Division of Sponsored Programs</P></CENTER>

<P>The Division of Sponsored Programs administers externally sponsored grants and contracts for both research and instruction.  This involves serving as the central resource for information on funding opportunities and administering the programmatic aspects of grants and contracts.</P>

<P>Information is collected, maintained, and disseminated to the faculty and staff concerning available external funding opportunities.  The staff serves as a liaison between the UGA community and external funding agencies in matters of sponsored program activities.  Faculty seek assistance from Sponsored Programs staff in the preparation and submission of proposals and in accepting awards.</P>  

<P>As the central repository, Sponsored Programs serves as the office of record on research and instructional sponsored program activity.  </P>

<CENTER><H2>An Element of Survival</H2></CENTER>

<P>ATHENS, Ga. -- No one knows exactly why or how an HIV infection turns into AIDS, or
why some HIV-positive people survive for many years without developing the disease.</P>
<P>Will Taylor believes diet may be part of the answer.</P>
 <P>In particular, the key appears to be selenium, an element that is essential in trace amounts
but, ironically, is toxic at high levels. And although it lacks the high-profile glamour of, say,
vitamin C, selenium plays an important role in the human body. According to Taylor, selenium
may be even more crucial to the human immune system, and to viruses, than anyone expected.</P>
 <P>Taylor has discovered genes both in HIV and in human T cells that may be blueprints for
selenium-containing proteins. Human T cells -- white blood cells that are part of the body's
defense against disease -- normally repel invaders but HIV successfully attacks them.</P>
 <P>"As far as what these T cell genes are doing or what their purpose is, it's hard to say,"
said Taylor, a UGA associate professor of medicinal chemistry. "But I think that it certainly fits
into the HIV story and is further reason to believe that selenium will have some beneficial effect.
The idea that competition by the virus for selenium would mess something up certainly seems
even more probable now."</P>
 <P>In the AIDS mystery, most people accept that the butler -- HIV -- kills the patient, and
their only question is how the crime is committed. Researchers generally have thought that
selenium only plays a bit part in the story: After AIDS strikes, it causes selenium levels to drop
because the victim's body loses its ability to absorb selenium. The reduced level of selenium
then contributes to symptoms such as a weakened immune system and weakened heart tissue.</P>
 <P>Taylor suggests just the opposite: HIV kidnaps selenium, thus lowering the body's
selenium level and triggering the infection to develop into full-blown AIDS. In theory the revised
story goes something like this: By producing selenoproteins, the newly discovered HIV genes
create an additional demand for selenium that slowly depletes the body's supply. At the same
time, the immune system needs more selenium to fight the infection. When selenium levels drop
too low, HIV replicates out of control, wreaks havoc on the immune system by killing T cells
and results in AIDS.</P>
 <P>Although Taylor's work remains controversial, he makes a strong case for selenium's
central role.</P>
 <P>Until Taylor has experimental proof that these genes produce selenoproteins, it's hard to
know whether the genes actually work the way he suggests. In the meantime, he has assembled
two lines of circumstantial evidence for his case that implicates selenium.</P>
 <P>Exhibit A: These genes provide a neat and tidy interpretation that links a lot of otherwise
isolated findings on selenium and AIDS.</P>
 <P>Exhibit B: In several other diseases, a selenium deficiency triggers the worst from
viruses.</P>
 <P>The upshot of all this is that the butler -- HIV -- may not be acting alone in a complicated
plot that disrupts selenium's previously unsuspected activities in viruses and the human immune
system. Solving this whodunit would be a big step toward stopping the disease.</P>
 <P>"These genes certainly put all the information on HIV and selenium in a different light
because they show that T cells are probably doing things with selenium that are far more
involved than anyone has previously thought," Taylor said.</P>
 <P>Missing Links and Smoking Guns</P>
 <P>Until now, the chief suspect in this selenium mystery has been the enzyme glutathione
peroxidase. Of the six known selenoproteins in the human body, glutathione peroxidase is the
one most directly related to the "wasting syndrome" in AIDS. This enzyme protects cells from
free radicals, oxygen byproducts that steal electrons and weaken cell membranes.</P>
 <P>As AIDS progresses, the argument goes, the wasting syndrome causes selenium, along
with other nutrients, to be poorly absorbed by the digestive system, which in turn lowers the
supply of glutathione peroxidase and leads to the selenium deficiency symptoms.</P>
 <P>However, this seems to be a chicken-or-egg scenario, since selenium deficiency not only
results from the wasting syndrome but also causes the wasting symptoms at the same time.</P>
 <P>The
question remains: How, exactly, does the butler do it?</P>
 <P>A more satisfactory explanation would eliminate the chicken-or-egg problem. It would be
better if, say, some extra demand for selenium lowers the body's supply and triggers an HIV
explosion that leads to the wasting syndrome and full-blown AIDS. All that's missing is the
smoking gun.</P>
 <P>Enter Taylor and his HIV "selenium genes."</P>
 <P>Taylor initially was studying how therapeutic drugs such as AZT might disrupt the way
the virus reproduces. But deep down in the genetic nuts and bolts of HIV, he ran across the clues
for solving an entirely different mystery.</P>
 <P>"You have to realize I was not out looking for new genes in HIV," Taylor said. "How
could there possibly be new genes in HIV? I mean, HIV's been around for 10 years. The genetic
sequence of HIV has been thoroughly dissected by the greatest scientific minds. That's not
something you'd even be looking for."</P>
 <P>But he found them, and now Taylor finds himself outside of mainstream AIDS research,
arguing that maybe the butler's doing something completely unexpected.</P>
 <P>Besides Taylor's work, a trickle of other research and anecdotal evidence points to
selenium as a major player in this mystery. Selenium can slow the replication of HIV and the
progress of AIDS, and poor nutrient absorption alone can't explain the dramatic loss of selenium
in many AIDS patients. These are the clues for which Taylor's HIV genes are the candlestick in
the billiard room.</P>
 <P>These HIV genes and their selenoproteins also spell out a link between selenium and the
virus in which the egg definitely comes first, so to speak. Taylor said he suspects one of the HIV
selenoproteins acts as HIV's built-in form of birth control. To build these proteins, such genes
demand a good supply of selenium.  When the selenium is gone, the egg hatches and an HIV
population explosion results.  On top of that, the body can't produce glutathione peroxidase, and
so the wasting symptoms appear.</P>
 <P>But just when it looked like Taylor had the case against selenium wrapped up, critics
pointed out that, even with all these new genes, the virus alone probably couldn't deplete
selenium to the levels seen in many AIDS patients. Taylor initially worked around this
discrepancy, but he wasn't completely happy with his explanation.</P>
<P> Something was still missing -- something to explain the correlation between selenium
levels and immune system T cell counts that has been observed in the elderly, in AIDS patients
and in animals. He dove into the literature and surfaced with a few choice tidbits.</P>
<P> First, Japanese researchers had noticed a statistical anomaly in the makeup of the virus's
DNA, a region that resembled human DNA. And it was in precisely the same region as one of his
selenium genes. A second paper proposed an evolutionary link between that very same genetic
region of HIV and a surface protein on human T cells, called CD4. That's when the case cracked
wide open.</P>
<P> "My logic was, if my gene overlaps with this region of the HIV envelope gene, and this
gene has some relationship to CD4, I'd better look in CD4 and see what I find," said Taylor,
whose results were  published in the August 1995 issue of Biological Trace Element Research.
"It's very common that viruses will simply steal genes from their host, because it's part of their
Trojan horse mechanism for getting inside the host cells."</P>
<P> When he looked at the genetic code for human T cells, Taylor saw selenium's
unmistakable footprints. The clues that had led to new HIV genes directed him right to new
human genes that could produce selenoproteins.</P>
<P> Forget AIDS for a second. These new T cell genes open up a whole new set of questions
about the human immune system. "There's just so much literature out there on selenium as a sort
of immune stimulator," Taylor said. "That certainly begins to make a lot more sense in the light
of this finding of new selenoproteins in T cells." What these genes could mean to immunology
has intrigued researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who are now taking
a new look at T cells.</P>
<P> With respect to the AIDS mystery, these new human genes -- one in CD4 and another in a
similar T cell protein -- could explain the rest of the missing selenium, especially considering
recent findings about T cells in AIDS patients: Several teams of U.S. researchers found that
between 1 billion and 8 billion T cells are destroyed and replaced every day in the bodies of
AIDS patients. If each T cell tries to create a protein with 10 selenium atoms per molecule, that
creates an enormous demand for selenium.</P>
 <P>A Common Modus Operandi</P>
<P> This massive turnover of T cells fleshes out the modus operandi for selenium's
disappearance. As long as there's enough selenium to go around, the virus coexists with its host,
as it does in long-term HIV-positive survivors. However, when selenium supplies run low, the
virus population explodes and sets off a chain reaction that causes T cells to be destroyed and
replaced by the billions, sucks the selenium well completely dry and results in all the symptoms
of full-blown AIDS.</P>
<P> This scenario, while novel for HIV, may mimic a pattern researchers have seen in other
diseases. In the literature, Taylor found extensive evidence of a link between selenium deficiency
and other viral diseases.</P>
<P> Kaposi's sarcoma, which causes cancerous lesions on the victim's body, and Keshan
disease, which causes heart damage in women of child-bearing age and even small children, both
seem to follow a similar path from selenium deficiency to viral disease.</P>
<P> As well as being common in AIDS patients, Kaposi's sarcoma is endemic to some
African regions with selenium-poor volcanic soils. The people who live there are often
selenium-deficient because they subsist on the plants and animals raised on those soils. Similarly,
Keshan disease affects people in regions of China that have selenium-poor soil, and the disease
has been controlled largely by nutritional supplements that include selenium.</P>
<P> However, in each case, not everyone living in the region suffers from the disease, which
suggests that some infectious agent triggers it. In fact, a herpes virus recently has been found in
Kaposi's lesions. From Keshan patients, Chinese researchers isolated several viruses, and their
No. 1 suspect was a strain of coxsackievirus, a class of viruses that cause a wide variety of
human ailments ranging from sore throat and muscle aches to skin lesions and heart inflamation.</P>
<P> Taking the finding from Keshan disease one step further, teams led by Melinda Beck at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Orville Levander at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture recently showed that coxsackieviruses turn nasty without their selenium "fix." The
researchers injected a benign strain of coxsackievirus into selenium-deficient mice, and the virus
mutated into a harmful strain that caused heart damage. In fact, when this mutated strain was
injected into selenium-normal mice, it still damaged the heart muscle.</P>
<P> Speculations on why the virus goes on its rampage range from weakened immune
response to weakened ability to eliminate free radicals -- the same reasons currently used to
explain how HIV causes AIDS. On the other hand, Taylor has found selenium-encoding genes in
the same strain of coxsackievirus, which suggests that this virus may have followed the same
path to heart disease in mice that Taylor proposes for HIV leading to AIDS.</P>
<P> "Maybe there are evolutionary reasons why viruses would actually be just as happy not to
kill you," Taylor said. "They'd like to keep themselves in balance with their host. So I think we
need to ask more if things have been in balance in the past, and maybe in long-term survivors,
HIV is in balance."</P>
<P> Although Taylor has built a substantial case based on theoretical and circumstantial
evidence, he does not have quite enough to convict. To convince the jury of his peers,
experiments must show that at least one of his genes produces a selenoprotein with some kind of
biological function.</P>
<P> Because the proteins could be created only in minute quantities, detecting them in
HIV-positive patients is difficult. So Taylor is taking another approach. </P>
<P> Along with a collaborator at Ohio State University, he is trying to clone one of the
selenium proteins and show that it has some biological function. This particular protein bears a
suspicious resemblance to DNA-binding proteins, which stick to DNA and regulate the activity
of genes.</P>
<P> "If we can prove that protein has any kind of biological activity, that would pretty much
substantiate it," Taylor said. "It would be nice if we can prove it really has the activities we
predicted, but you can only expect so much out of the theory. We can suggest possibilities, but
the reality might be something different."

<CENTER><H2>Polly Wants a Vaccine</H2></CENTER>
<P>WRITER: David Hart, (706) 542-8808<BR>
SOURCE: Branson Ritchie, (706) 542-6316</P>

<P>    Forget the crackers. These birds need medical help. Their  feathers rot and fall off. Sometimes their beaks crack and  crumble away. Eventually, the infected parrots, macaws and  cockatoos die, victims of PBFD -- psittacine beak and feather  disease.</P>

<P>    The virus that causes the deadly disease has plagued these  birds in captivity and in the wild for years.  However, a team  from UGA's College of Veterinary Medicine has developed a test to  identify the virus, and a vaccine may soon follow.</P>

<P>    "The disease itself is not treatable. A bird that gets the  virus will either kill the virus or develop the disease," said  Branson Ritchie, an associate professor of small animal medicine.  "A vaccine would protect healthy birds from becoming infected in  the first place."</P>

<P>    More than 40 species of psittacines -- the family of birds  that also includes parakeets, budgerigars (budgies), lovebirds  and cockatiels -- are susceptible to PBFD; the disease also was  diagnosed recently in Australian doves. Researchers from  Australia had done some "phenomenal" preliminary work describing  the disease and its pathology, Ritchie said, but it wasn't until  1987 that the UGA team tracked down the guilty virus.</P>

<P>    Before 1987, veterinarians could do little for infected  birds. "I was putting eight or 10 birds to sleep per week coming  out of quarantine with this disease," Ritchie said. "At that time  people were discussing it as anything from a bacterial infection  to endocrine abnormalities, fungal infections, stress-related  factors or nutritional problems."</P>

<P>    The virus eluded detection for years because it refused to  cooperate with traditional virology methods, especially the  tactic of growing a virus in a laboratory cell culture.</P>

<P>    "Because this virus wouldn't grow in cell culture, we had to  back up and use other techniques to try to recover the virus from  its natural host and then use molecular biology techniques to  characterize it, work with it and figure it out," Ritchie said.</P>

<P>    What they found was something new: a very small, very hardy  virus that is almost in a class by itself. Along with a handful  of other viruses -- one that infects pigeons, one in pigs and  perhaps one in chickens -- the PBFD virus belongs to a new class  of viruses, the Circoviridae.</P>

<P>    Armed with the same molecular techniques used to detect the  virus, team member Frank Niagro of the department of medical  microbiology then developed a DNA probe to test for the disease.  The test can detect the virus in the bloodstream before an  infected bird shows clinical signs of PBFD.</P>

<P>    "What this allows clinicians to do is to manage the disease,  in essence prevent the disease from ever being introduced to a  flock," Ritchie said.</P>

<P>    To go beyond simply managing the spread of the disease to  actually wiping it out requires a vaccine. That's what they're  working on now, Ritchie said. Initially, the team derived a  vaccine from the tissues of infected birds, but this method has  its problems.</P>

<P>    "The virus is very difficult to kill," Ritchie said. "The  only way that you could tell that a virus in a vaccine derived  from this tissue was killed was to inject it into an animal. If  the animal developed antibodies to the virus, the vaccine was  good; if the animal developed disease from the vaccine, then the  vaccine was not good.</P>

<P>    "So it was not at all practical or safe to use that initial  vaccine. What it gave us was a positive control, a research  model, that would let us test a safe vaccine," he said.</P>

<P>    To find a vaccine that won't infect the patients, the  research team is exploring two possibilities. The first relies on  the classic method of growing the virus in a cell culture; the  second strategy is to develop a recombinant vaccine, in which  only a piece of the virus's DNA is used. Ritchie said both  methods are running neck and neck; either could produce a vaccine  within the next year.</P>

<P>    "From the perspectives of this country and Europe, neither  of which has the virus in a free-ranging bird population, beak- and-feather disease can be totally eradicated by vaccination,"  Ritchie said.</P>

<P>    Now that's something to squawk about.</P>

<P>WRITER:  Faith Peppers (404) 455-8474<BR>
SOURCES: Franklin Pokorny (706) 542-0785, Paul Thomas (706) 542-2340</P>

<P>    Go to the nearest container-grown plant, stick your finger  in the dirt and ask, "What's in there?"</P>

<P>    Nobody knows. At least, not exactly.</P>

<P>    Most likely it's some mixture of soilless growing media --  dirtless dirt. A combination of organic matter and something  inorganic like sand or perlite, it's what most container plants  are grown in now.</P>

<P>    Growers like soilless mixes because they're lightweight and  drain well.</P>

<P>    "Soil can be highly variable in content and pH, and can  contain undesirable pathogens or nematodes," said UGA professor  Franklin Pokorny. "Generally, soilless mixes don't have these  problems."</P>

<P>    For years the standard mixes were largely peat moss and  sand. In 1960, though, Pokorny began investigating using pine  bark, a waste product at the time, to replace peat.</P>

<P>    Pine bark has since become a standard and Pokorny the top  authority in a field that, after decades of study, he can still  say is in its infancy.</P>

<P>    That doesn't mean the research hasn't come a long way.</P>

<P>    And the work is gaining a new tool to speed the process: UGA  researcher Silvia Bures's work is taking the guesswork out of  potting mixes.</P>

<P>    Combining physics and horticulture, Bures used computers to  simulate what happens when soilless media particles are mixed.  She and colleagues Alan Ferrenberg and David Landau designed a  program that ultimately will allow manufacturers to create the  ideal mix for any need.</P>

<P>    The possibilities are endless.</P>

<P>    "Every day some industry has waste they want to convert into  profitable material," Pokorny said. </P>

<P>    The problem is: Endless materials and particle sizes make  the exact nature of soilless mixtures a mystery even to the  people who make them.</P>

<P>    "When this technology is far enough along," Pokorny said.  "it should help manufacturers and nurseries that make their own  mixes know what's in them. It will provide consumers a known  uniform product, presumably at lower prices."</P>

<P>    The research, though, seems as endless as the possibilities.</P>

<P>    "We're the only ones working along these lines, trying to  model container media," Pokorny said. "It opens a tremendous area  for study."</P>

<P>    It's a risk scientists run in any new area. The work is slow  because you can't leapfrog ahead on other people's research. How  fast your work develops depends on the support it gains.</P>

<P>    So designer dirt may yet be a long way off.</P>

<P>    "I'd hate to try to predict when it will have practical  usage, but if I had to hazard a guess," Pokorny said, "I'd say  we're a decade away. But you never know. Things happen."</P>

<P>    Things happen, indeed.</P>

<P>    In 1992, Georgia growers thought an epidemic of black thumb  was going around when large-greenhouse owners and homeowners  alike had plants turning yellow and dying.</P>

<P>    "Nurserymen had trees die within weeks of transplanting,"  said UGA extension horticulturist Paul Thomas. "Poinsettia and  pansy growers' plants looked terrible."</P>

<P>    Thomas and Larry Windham, president of the Georgia  Commercial Flower Growers Association, studied the mysterious  malady and found the dirty culprit: soilless mixes with too much  fertilizer and a high pH.</P>

<P>    Without an ingredients list to check, "the growers  inadvertently made matters worse by adding more fertilizer,"  Thomas said.</P>

<P>    When people realized the problem had cost them more than  half a million dollars, support grew quickly for some landmark  legislation.</P>

<P>    As a result of Thomas's studies and the groundswell of  support for change, the Georgia General Assembly passed the  Georgia Horticultural Growing Media Act of 1993.</P>

<P>    The law, which took effect July 1, 1994, requires soilless  media manufacturers to register their products with the state  Department of Agriculture.</P>

<P>    Now consumers can know pH and type of fertilizer in a media  mix and what plants will grow in it. "For the first time, we'll  have soil information to manage plant growth," Thomas said.</P>

<P>    Both Thomas and Pokorny said they expect the law to be  quickly duplicated in other states.</P>

<P>    Suddenly, manufacturers everywhere may be pondering pots and  wondering what, precisely, to put in there to provide the most  reliable soilless mixes for whatever growers grow.</P>

<P>    Momentum may be gathering.</P>

<P> ATHENS, Ga. -- Parents worldwide hope their children will bear the best traits from each
side of the family -- the genes for a certain eye or hair color, "brains" or ability.</P>
<P> But when researchers crossed two varieties of rice -- one from Texas, the other from
China -- they got much more than they expected in the hybrid offspring: a rice plant with
increased photosynthesis and, therefore, dramatically increased yields.</P>
<P> "We have finally been able to successfully increase photosynthesis -- and couple that
with an increase in yield," said Clanton Black, a UGA research professor of biochemistry. "I
think we are the first people ever to do that successfully."</P>
<P> During five years of field testing in China and two in Arkansas, the Oryza sativa rice
hybrid consistently has produced more than 20 percent higher yields than the average of the
parent varieties, Black said. Last year, the hybrid crop set near record yields of 208 bushels per
acre in Arkansas, where rice farmers usually expect half that amount.</P>
<P> One of Black's former students, Zeng-Ping Tu, bred the hybrid while in China. Tu's goal
was to combine selected traits of both parents to produce a rice plant that would grow in a wide
range of environments, from flat coastal areas to mountain foothills. That's why Tu chose to
cross a standard commercial rice of good quality from a monsoon climate with one from the
coast of Texas. </P>
<P> "It is a broadly adapted plant, but much more broadly adapted than Mr. Tu anticipated,"
Black said, referring to the plant's increased photosynthetic ability.</P>
<P> Photosynthesis allows plants to capture energy from light and convert it to sugar for
maintenance and growth. Scientists have long searched for a way to make the process more
effective.</P>
<P> Black, who grew up on a central Florida farm, said he's spent much of the past 35 years
seeking the solution. The unexpected increase in photosynthesis in Tu's rice hybrid placed the
researchers a step closer.</P>
<P> Most plants undergo a "midday depression" in photosynthesis to protect themselves from
the brunt of the sun's intensity. But the hybrid is different.</P>
<P> "There is some small midday depression, but the hybrid avoids the strong inhibition of
photosynthesis during the middle of the day," he said. "That means [the plant conducts] more
photosynthesis and it's sort of like more interest in the bank. You're making more interest, so
you grow a little faster."</P>
<P> The hybrid can avoid the midday depression because it contains a greater amount of
carotenoids -- yellow pigments that are able to absorb light energy and dissipate it without the
formation of harmful products -- than its parents.</P>
<P> Additionally, the hybrid increases by eight to 10 days the life span of the "flag leaf,"
which forms under the rice grain and produces photosynthetic products like sugar that nourish
grain formation. The hybrid also develops a canopy of leaves for increased light interception
more rapidly than its parents.</P>
<P> "It puts out what I like to call a green umbrella over the soil so that it gets the area
covered in and gets maximum light interception," Black said. "Since it can do this faster, the
whole plant grows quicker."</P>
<P> The hybrid's overall life span is six to 12 days shorter than its parents, perhaps because it
grows faster and therefore completes its life cycle in less time, he said.</P>
<P> So far, researchers have not observed any problems with the hybrid, only benefits, Black
said.</P>
<P> "The folks in Arkansas this year put it through quality testing, and the man who did it
said it was amongst the high quality rices he'd seen," Black said.</P>
<P> In addition, the hybrid is very resistant to blast disease, a fungal disease that poses a big
problem for farmers in some regions, such as the mountainous areas of China.</P>
<P> The hybrid currently is available in China, and several  companies in Arkansas are
interested in field testing it for possible marketing in the United States.</P>
<P> It is hard to predict, though, what impact the hybrid might have as a cash crop because
rice is the most locally consumed crop in the world, Black said. Ninety-six percent of rice is
consumed where it is grown, so only a small portion of the world's rice ever reaches the world
market. Still, rice is the main staple of a large portion of the world's population, he added.</P>
<P> "If you make 20 percent more rice, you could sell more in town or on the export market,"
he said. "You might eventually observe that happening, but I think that's way down the road."</P>
<P> Even though the hybrid's economic impact may lie in the future, its scientific impact is
immediate and important, Black said.</P>
<P> "Other hybrids could be made in a similar fashion by taking parents that have traits that
are useful -- photosynthetic-type traits or yield traits -- and making other crosses," he said.
"We're doing more of those crosses now with rice. You can extrapolate this to any number of
crops."

Laws, Regulations, Policies, and Procedures Governing Research
<hr size=4 width=600>
</center>
</font>
<P>University of Georgia research policies are subject to the policies of the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia.  Faculty and staff are expected to be familiar with and to adhere to federal, state, and University regulations and policies that govern research.  Failure to comply may jeopardize not only the individual research project but also the entire University research program. </P>

<P>Because the scope of this handbook is limited to research, it is suggested that each reader review a copy of the University statutes and become familiar with policy matters not covered in this handbook.  Additional policies also are published in The University of Georgia Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual.</P>

<A NAME="FSLR">
<CENTER><H2>FEDERAL/STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS</H2></CENTER>

<A NAME="ACU">
<P><B>Animal Care and Use</B></P>

<P>Faculty who use animals in research or teaching are responsible to do so in accordance with University policies.  The University has a formal process to assure federal agencies that applicable laws and guidelines are followed.  Prior to initiating an animal requisition, an Animal Use Proposal Form must be submitted, including plans for appropriate animal care, to the Director of Animal Care and Use.  Information on procedures for submission of animal use proposals and compliance with the University policy is available from the Director of Animal Care and Use, Boyd Graduate Studies Research Center, 542-5933.  </P>

<P>Animal care activities are coordinated by veterinary personnel who are joint staffed within units and the OVPR.  These specialists in laboratory animal medicine provide veterinary care and consultation for projects that require the use of animals.</P>

<A NAME="BIO">
<P><B>Biosafety </B></P>

<P>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules apply to any institution that receives NIH support.  These guidelines also are used extensively on a voluntary basis by institutions and industries that do not receive NIH support and, therefore, they set a precedent for the conduct of certain types of research.  Additionally, numerous federal agencies are developing or have developed regulations pertaining to genetic engineering or research involving biohazardous agents.  The federal government has enacted legislation that may affect certain kinds of federally funded research.  For example, the National Environmental Protection Act applies to any "major federal action which may have a significant impact on the environment."  </P>

<DT><P>The Georgia Environmental Protection Division has established regulations that govern the disposal of biomedical waste and these regulations affect laboratories using biohazardous agents.  The University of Georgia policies on biohazardous research are found in the Biosafety Manual.  To obtain a copy of the manual, more information about various federal agency guidelines, or additional information on biosafety, contact the University's Biosafety Officer, Boyd Graduate Studies Research Center, 542-0112.  </P>

<A NAME="COI">
<P><B>Conflict of Interest</B></P>

<P>It is important for faculty, staff, and administrators to avoid conflicts of interest between or among research obligations, outside interests, and other UGA obligations.  A number of laws, rules, regulations, and policies already address conflicts of interest.  <A href="./appendix/coi_pol.html">The University of Georgia Conflicts of Interest Policy</A> supplements these existing laws and policies by providing guidelines and administrative procedures to prevent and resolve potential conflicts that may exist in relation to sponsored instruction, research and service activities with federal agencies.  This Policy requires a disclosure of external interests and activities by faculty members to be provided with each proposal submitted to a federal agency.</P>

<P>Faculty members must comply with all applicable state and federal regulations pertaining to conflicts of interest.  For assistance with specific concerns, contact the Legal Advisor to the Office of the Vice President for Research, 542-5944.
</P>

<A NAME="Data">
<P><B>Data Rights</B></P>

<P>Rights to data produced during the course of sponsored research shall be determined in accordance with the applicable grant or contract.  Federal regulations provide for the UGA or the UGARF to register and hold copyright to scientific and technical publications based on or containing data first produced in the performance of a research contract and published in academic, technical, or professional journals, symposia proceedings, or similar works.  Additional rights may be obtained from the federal government upon petition to the appropriate agency.</P>

<P>Data rights applicable to grants typically are set forth in grant guidelines or agency publications.  Rights to data and biological materials developed during the course of industry-supported research are determined by the research agreement.</P>

<P>For questions or assistance regarding data rights, contact the Legal Advisor to the Office of the Vice President for Research, Boyd Graduate Studies Research Center, 542-5944.</P>

<A NAME="DAS">
<P><B>Debarment and Suspension</B></P>

<P>Debarment and suspension guidelines, published in 1988, are designed to protect the federal government against fraudulent and unethical contractors.  Should the University fail to comply, it would be unable to receive or request federal funds.  </P>

<P>University personnel are responsible for ensuring that contracts are not made with persons or agencies that are presently debarred, proposed for debarment, suspended, or declared ineligible  for covered transactions by any federal agency or department.  Contracts cannot be made with persons or agencies that within the past three years have been convicted of or have had civil judgement rendered against them for a fraudulent contract or transaction, violation of federal or state antitrust laws, or the commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsifying or destroying records, receiving stolen property, or making false statements.  For additional information contact the Division of Sponsored Programs, 542-5939.</P>

<A NAME="DFW">
<P><B>Drug-Free Workplace</B></P>

<P>As a recipient of federal funds, The University of Georgia supports and complies with provisions of the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988.  All University faculty and staff are expected to meet appropriate standards of performance, to observe basic rules of conduct, and to comply with institutional personnel policies and procedures.  The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of illegal drugs in the workplace by UGA employees is prohibited by institutional policy.  Violation of this policy, including felony and/or misdemeanor conviction of any criminal drug statute arising out of or in connection with activities at the workplace of a University employee, may result in appropriate disciplinary penalties being imposed upon the employee by the University.  As a condition of employment, University faculty and staff agree to abide by the terms of this policy statement and to notify the UGA of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five working days after the conviction.</P>

<P>The University offers a drug abuse awareness program as part of its employee wellness program series.  Periodic notification of availability of program sessions to all faculty and staff is made through appropriate University channels.  Faculty and staff are encouraged to participate in these programs.  A current list of available drug counseling, rehabilitation, or treatment centers is maintained by the Office of Human Resources, 542-2621, and the University Health Services, 542-8715.</P>

<A NAME="GLP">
<P><B>Good Laboratory Practice</B></P>

<P>The Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency are responsible for assuring that chemicals and microorganisms are safe and effective for their intended purposes.  Accordingly, the agencies have formulated Good Laboratory Practice regulations for the conduct of studies intended to be submitted for regulatory approval.  These regulations require stringent conditions of experimentation, data collection,  recording, and oversight that are not usually practiced in academic research.  Before planning or undertaking such studies, please contact the Associate Director for Technology Transfer, Boyd Graduate Studies Research Center, 542-5929.</P>

<A NAME="HSO">
<P><B>Human Subjects Office</B></P>

<P>Research involving human subjects must comply with federal and University policies.  This protects researchers as well as participants.  The Human Subjects Office staff oversees all research that uses human subjects as part of the data collection and provides a contact for participants concerned with their rights as subjects. </P>

<P>Regulations from the National Institutes of Health, as well as UGA policies, apply to all research involving human subjects, whether done by students or faculty, and with or without external funding.  Surveys, interviews, educational strategies, questionnaires, and review of medical or other records require prior approval.  The University must report instances of noncompliance to the Office for Protection from Research Risk at the National Institutes of Health.  The University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) is authorized to suspend or terminate any investigation involving human subjects if, in its opinion, the evidence warrants.  </P>

<A NAME="Lobby">
<P><B>Lobbying</B></P>

<P>Congress enacted legislation on December 23, 1989, that placed restrictions on lobbying activities of institutions and their employees who receive federal contracts, grants, and loans.  By accepting federal funds, the University and its faculty and staff must comply with the legislation, which applies to all federal contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements that exceed $100,000 and to all federal loans that exceed $150,000.</P>

<P>Because many University employees are involved in federal grant applications and submissions, it is important they be aware of the restrictions this law may place on their activities.  In essence, these restrictions prohibit University employees from communicating with a federal agency or Congress with the intent of influencing the making of a federal award.</P>

<P>Under this law, recipients of federal awards in excess of these threshold amounts are prohibited from using the appropriated funds to lobby the federal government in connection with the making of any federal award.  Consequently, the University is prohibited from using federal funds to pay its employees, or any other person, for influencing or attempting to influence a federal employee regarding the awarding of a federal contract, grant, or loan.</P>

<P>When requesting or receiving a federal award, the University is required to certify, in writing, that it has not used federal funds to pay its employees or others for prohibited lobbying activities.  In addition, the University must disclose whether any non-federal funds were used to pay employees or others for lobbying activities that would be forbidden if federal funds were used.  </P>

<P>The law does not prohibit all forms of communication between contract or grant recipients and federal agencies.  For example, the law does not prohibit recipients from providing information that has been specifically requested by a federal employee or member of Congress.  Neither does it affect professional or technical services rendered during the preparation of a federal award that are necessary to meet requirements imposed as a condition of receiving an award.  It only applies to communications intended to influence a federal agency or Congress in making an award.</P>

<DT><P>The University is responsible for submitting the required certification forms to federal agencies.  However, all individuals involved with federal contracts and grants should be informed of this legislation so they will be aware that the law prohibits certain lobbying activities.  For further information, contact the Office of the Vice President for Legal Affairs, Old College, 542-0006.  </P>

<A NAME="MIS">
<P><B>Misconduct in Science</B></P>

<P>A misconduct in science policy has been adopted by the UGA in compliance with various federal laws, regulations, and policies that deal with misconduct in research.  These laws, regulations, and policies require universities that receive federal funds to establish administrative procedures to review allegations of misconduct in connection with research.  This policy pertains to all federally funded research conducted at the University.  The Office of the Vice President for Research is responsible for implementing this policy and for acting as liaison with external agencies and individuals making allegations.</P>

<P>The integrity of the programs of the University requires that faculty, staff, and students demand high standards of conduct of themselves and of others, that appropriate sanctions be imposed when misconduct has occurred, and that the reputations of those ultimately cleared of charges be restored to the extent possible.  Allegations of misconduct must be resolved in a prompt and just manner, assuring that no recriminations will befall a person making allegations in good faith.</P>

<A NAME="Nepotism">
<P><B>Nepotism</B></P>

<P>Policies pertaining to nepotism are set forth in the Policy Manual of the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, Section 802.03 "Employment of Relatives," and The University of Georgia Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual, Section 61.05-1 "Restrictions on Employment."  These policies prohibit a subordinate-superior relationship between an individual and a relative.  This prohibition does not apply to temporary or part-time employment of children under age 25, or a situation where an individual was employed as of February 14, 1990, and the relative holding a superior position is at least one level of supervision removed from the individual, or where the Board of Regents grants an exception under the policy.  The policies further provide that relationship by family or marriage shall constitute neither an advantage nor a disadvantage in hiring.</P>

<P>For further information, contact the Office of the Vice President for Legal Affairs, Old College, 542-0006.</P>

<A NAME="NIE">
<P><B>Non-Discrimination in Employment</B></P>

<P>In keeping with University policies, research units follow an equal opportunity/affirmative action policy of non-discrimination in employment.  A copy of the policies regarding this issue is available by contacting the Equal Opportunity Office, 542-7912.
 
<A NAME="Integrity">
<P><B>Procurement Integrity</B></P>

<P>The Federal Procurement Policy Act is designed to prevent corrupt practices in the award of federal contracts.  The Act does not apply to grants.  In general, the Act prohibits competing contractors and federal government procurement officials from soliciting, promising, or discussing post-government employment or business opportunities, offering or accepting gifts, and soliciting, obtaining, or disclosing sensitive business information.  The Act applies to all contracts with the federal government.  For contracts over $100,000, the Act requires that, before the award of the contract, the contractor must certify in writing to the government contracting officer that the contractor has no information concerning any violation or possible violation of the law.  Alternatively, the contractor must disclose all information concerning any violation and certify in writing that all information has been disclosed.  The regulations which implement the Act further require that the contractor obtain a separate certification from all officers, employees, agents, representatives, and consultants who participate personally and substantially in the procurement process.  The certification must ensure that such individuals are familiar with the Act, will comply with it, and will report any violation.</P>

<A NAME="RS">
<P><B>Radiation Safety</B></P>

<P>The University of Georgia possesses a broad license for the use of radioactive materials in teaching and research.  The license is administered by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.  A state agreement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission specifies that the state program will be compatible with federal regulations.  The University license specifies that persons using radioactive materials must comply with University policy as well as state regulations.</P>

<P>University faculty who use radioactive materials are individually licensed by the Radiation Safety Committee.  Information concerning requirements and licensing procedures or assistance in the use and handling of radioactive materials may be obtained by calling the Radiation Safety Office at 542-5801.  </P>

<A NAME="Other">
<P><B>Other</B></P>

<P>There are regulations under the Export Administration Act which can have an impact on research.  For example, computer, computer products, and biologicals may require a license for export to certain foreign countries.  When in doubt, it is advisable to seek the advice of the Legal Advisor to the Office of the Vice President for Research, 542-5944 or the Office of the Vice President for Legal Affairs, 542-0006.</P>

<A NAME="UPP">
<P><CENTER>UNIVERSITY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</CENTER></P>

<A NAME="CFR">
<P><B>Consulting for Remuneration</B></P>

<P>Consulting is defined as external professional activities for pay, and includes any activity that: is performed on an individual contractual basis for any individual(s), firm or agency other than The University of Georgia; is based on the professional knowledge, experience and abilities of the faculty member; is undertaken for personal compensation beyond the payment of a nominal honorarium and/or reimbursement of expenses; and clearly enhances the professional development and expertise of the faculty member.</P>

<P>Appropriate consulting activities may be mutually beneficial to the faculty and the University and may result in improved teaching, research and/or service.  Hence, reasonable participation in consulting is encouraged within the parameters described in Section 802.1602 of the Policy Manual of the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia.  Faculty should review the consulting policy of the respective school, college, or unit to ensure compliance with all policies and procedures, including prior approval of the appropriate official(s).</P>

<P>Consulting does not include private business undertakings of faculty members nor those responsibilities which are part of their regular professional responsibilities to the University for which they are already being compensated.</P>

<P>In some cases, there may appear to be  a "gray area" between a research agreement and a consulting agreement.  All research agreements must be submitted through the Division of Sponsored Programs.  All consulting agreements should be approved by the appropriate unit head.  Faculty are cautioned not to sign a conflicting patent agreement.  For assistance please contact the Legal Advisor to the Office of the Vice President for Research, 542-5944.</P>

<A NAME="CS">
<P><B>Cost Sharing</B></P>

<P>The University frequently is required to share in the cost of sponsored projects.  Federal regulations require that when a department either has a contractual obligation to cost share or voluntarily agrees to cost share on a sponsored project, the University costs must be documented.  Therefore, it is imperative that those University costs be budgeted separately and expended as outlined in the Handbook on Personnel Activity Reporting As Specified in Federal Regulations, originally issued in July 1980 and revised in February 1991.  (Copies of this handbook are available from the Department of Contracts and Grants, 542-3721.)  The subject also is covered in Section 44.2 of The University of Georgia Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual.</P>

<P>Failure to budget and spend in a timely manner in the appropriate cost sharing account may result in federal audit disallowances for expenditures made from the related sponsored account.   Since any disallowed cost is the responsibility of the benefiting department, it is important that each department follow procedures required by federal regulations to identify and document cost sharing expenditures.  For further information, contact the Department Manager, Department of Contracts and Grants, Business Services Building, 542-6890.</P>

<A NAME="DCIPR">
<P><B>Disclosure of Confidential Information in Proposals and Reports</B></P>

<P>On occasion, a research proposal may disclose novel technology or an invention.  Such information may be commercially valuable and may warrant protection.  In general, proposals submitted to the United States Government are held in confidence unless awarded.  If a grant or contract is awarded, relevant proposals and reports are subject to public inspection.  The Freedom of Information Act includes provisions which protect commercially important information.  Procedures vary at federal agencies with regard to the disclosure of such proposals and reports.  Sometimes a federal agency will contact the UGARF prior to releasing such information.  However, this practice is not always followed.  Therefore, it is prudent to incorporate a notice on any proposal or report alerting the agency to the existence of commercially valuable information within the proposal or report.</P>

<P>The Federal Acquisition Regulations recommend use of the following legend for any proposal which incorporates valuable commercial information.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"This proposal or quotation includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed--in whole or in part--for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal or quotation.  If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror or quoter as a result of--or in connection with--the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract.  This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.  The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets (insert page numbers or other identifiers)."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Individual pages should be marked with the following legend:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or quotation."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If a proposal containing commercially important information is to be submitted to a private sponsor, the UGARF and the sponsor should enter into a Restricted Disclosure Agreement prior to such submission.  Staff of the Division of Sponsored Programs, 542-5939, and the Legal Advisor to the Office of the Vice President for Research, 542-5944, are available to assist project directors with questions regarding procedures that protect commercially important technical information.</P>

<A NAME="PGIC">
<P><B>Policies Governing Institutes and Centers</B></P>

<P>The interdisciplinary nature of issues that confront a contemporary university requires organizational forms and operating policies that cross traditional academic boundaries. Those institutes and centers that are formed as part of the UGA structure are designed to facilitate collaborative research efforts among faculty in different departments, schools, and colleges.  Institutes and centers should not duplicate the missions of departments, schools, or colleges; a key ingredient of an institute or center is its "value added."  </P>

<P>A memorandum dated May 11, 1990, from Vice President for Academic Affairs William F. Prokasy to the University Council Executive Committee outlines issues related to the establishment of an institute or center.  The memorandum, approved by the University Council on May 31, 1990, defines institutes and centers and presents criteria for the formation, review, and termination processes, administrative location, and appointment of faculty.  </P>

<A NAME="Publication">
<P><B>Publication Rights</B></P>

<P>It is the responsibility of the UGA and the UGARF to retain and protect the right of researchers to publish all research results.  When a contract for sponsored research is negotiated, the UGA or the UGARF can agree, under limited circumstances, to maintain the confidentiality of a sponsor's trade secret information provided to the University for performance of a research contract.  When such a contract is negotiated, the UGA or the UGARF may also, under limited circumstances, agree to delay publication of research results for a short period of time to enable the UGARF or a sponsor to obtain patent protection for such results.</P>

<P>For further information contact the Legal Advisor to the Office of the Vice President for Research, 542-5944.</P>

<A NAME="RC">
<P><B>Research Computing</B></P>

<P>University Computing and Networking Services (UCNS) operates and supports a
variety of computer facilities and the campus-wide data networking facilities
that provide access to campus, national, and international computer networks-

<A NAME="RPL">
<P><B>Research Professionals</B></P>

<P>Appointment and promotion of full-time research professionals at The University of Georgia are based on the scholarship of the candidates.  Scholarship, both a science and an art, extends knowledge through a public demonstration of disciplined inquiry and creative effort.  Persons in these positions are not eligible for tenure.  Otherwise, research professionals enjoy the same privileges and status as tenured or tenure-track faculty.  </P>

<P>Evidence of excellence in research or other creative activity includes, but is not limited to: books, reviews, monographs, bulletins, articles, and other scholarly works published by reputable journals, scholarly presses, and publishing houses that accept works only after rigorous review and approval by peers in the discipline; success in competing for grants and contracts subjected to rigorous peer review and approval to finance the development of ideas; citations of research in scholarly publications; prizes and awards for excellence of work; and membership on important scientific expeditions or membership on teams making artistic recordings of important events or engaging in the delivery of technology through project development.  Other supporting evidence may include professional activities within one's discipline, professional associations, and learned societies.  </P>

<P>Appointment to and promotion within the research professional ranks includes consideration of years in rank and levels of experience and accomplishment.  To be eligible for a research professional appointment, a person must have obtained  the terminal degree awarded in one's discipline.  Full-time research professionals are usually supported from grants or contracts.  Consequently, renewal of appointment and salary level usually depend on the successful renewal of outside support.  Appointments and promotions require approval by the Board of Regents.</P>

<A NAME="RPF">
<P><B>Research Professors</B></P>

<P>The appointment of Research Professors at The University of Georgia is a University-wide honor intended to recognize outstanding research or other creative, scholarly accomplishments and to provide the impetus for continuing high achievement.  The title of Research Professor is awarded for a five-year period to those academicians recognized for creative and original contributions to knowledge and whose work promises to continue to foster significant new concepts and understandings.  The Research Professor's work shall be at the highest levels of creativity in a discipline's theoretical or applied sectors, and is affirmed by recognized national and/or international leaders in that discipline.  Research Professors are expected to serve the University through research, instruction, and service.  The specific responsibilities of an individual holding a Research Professorship shall be determined by the department head and the dean of the appropriate school or college.   Appointment includes a one-time permanent increase in base pay of $7,000 plus a $10,000 account each year for a period of five years to be used in any appropriate way to support scholarship.  There is no limit on the number of individuals from any department or other academic unit who might simultaneously hold the title of Research Professor.</P>

<P>A group of five tenured faculty members, a department head, or a dean may nominate an individual to become a Research Professor.  Nominees must have gained at least ten years of experience beyond the date of the terminal academic degree and must have the endorsement of the appropriate department head and dean.  </P>

<A NAME="RT">
<P><B>Research Time</B></P>

<P>Based on the University's mission to conduct research, faculty members can expect encouragement and assistance from the University.  To this end, state money is used to pay a portion of a faculty member's salary for engaging in research activities.  A faculty member's research time is determined by the appropriate unit head.
		
<A NAME="SGPEF">
<P><B>Salary Guidelines for Personnel on Extramural Funds</B></P>

<P>Salary increases for all University employees are normally permitted on an annual basis to become effective at the next authorized salary adjustment date, usually July 1st of each year.  Mid-year staff increases are rare and are allowed only under certain conditions.  The guidelines for salary increases set by the Board of Regents and the President of the University each year apply to all personnel, whether paid from sponsored or non-sponsored funds.  The source or availability of funds is not the determining factor.  Salary amounts shown on applications to sponsoring agencies are not firm commitments.  They are estimates and should be submitted in line with regular University salaries for similar positions.  For more specific information, contact the Office of Human Resources, 542-2621.</P>

<A NAME="SR">
<P><B>Summer Research</B></P>

<P>A limited amount of state money is usually available for salaries of those persons on nine-month appointments who wish to engage in research during the summer quarter.  It is the responsibility of the appropriate unit head to determine which faculty members receive summer research money.  </P>

<CENTER><H2>Women Athletes Build Body and Bone</H2></CENTER>
<P>WRITER: Helen Fosgate, (706) 542-0809<BR>
CONTACT: Richard Lewis, (706) 542-4901</P>

<P>    Conventional wisdom holds that diet and exercise are crucial  for a healthy body. That's a precarious balance, however, for a  world-class gymnast -- especially one not yet in her teens.</P>

<P>    "Young women athletes are trying to maintain very low body  weight and low fat percentages," said UGA foods and nutrition  researcher Richard Lewis. "My intention is to study long-term  bone health as a consequence of diet and participation in  athletics."</P>

<P>    Female gymnasts and dancers, for example, may begin training  as young as age three and by the time they enter their second  decade are already under constant pressure to be fit and strong  but to look lean and "feminine." For this reason, eating  disorders are not uncommon among female athletes. Now researchers  have begun to question whether girls and young women who train in  gymnastics and other strenuous sports may be jeopardizing their  future health.</P>

<P>    Studies show female gymnasts consume fewer calories than  non-athletes, especially calories from calcium-rich dairy  products. More than half have a history of menstrual disruption  because their bodies simply cannot carry out this biological  function regularly. Studies also show that abnormal suppression  of menstruation and some eating disorders promote bone loss.  These facts led Lewis to take a closer look at the connection  between strenuous athletic training and osteoporosis, a common  disease of women.</P>

<P>    "We began our research with the idea that these athletes may  be at risk for osteoporosis because of the combination of  restrictive eating, heavy-duty exercise and irregular  menstruation," he said. </P>

<P>    In fact, that preconception turned out to be completely  wrong.</P>

<P>    Osteoporosis -- literally, "porous bones" -- affects more  than 25 million Americans. Twenty-five percent of women over the  age of 45 and 90 percent of those older than 75 suffer from the  condition, in which a loss of calcium gradually weakens the  bones. The tiny spaces between bone tissue grow larger, making  once-dense bones porous and fragile.</P>

<P>    Using a special X-ray machine that measures bone density,  Lewis compared the lumbar spine and hip bone densities of 30  female college gymnasts to a group of non-athletes of similar  size, age and weight. He also studied 20 former college gymnasts  who are now 35 to 40 years old and compared them to a similar  group of women who had never competed in sports. He was  especially interested in the bone health of former gymnasts since  women begin to lose bone mass after about age 30. </P>

<P>    Surprisingly, Lewis' studies showed that despite the  gymnasts' restricted diets and prevalence toward menstrual  irregularity, they had denser bone than their non-athlete  counterparts. Even the former gymnasts, whose lifestyles now  include a more normal diet and exercise regimen, posted higher  bone densities than other women their age.</P>

<P>    "It may be that participation in gymnastics actually offers  some residual protection against osteoporosis," Lewis said.</P>

<P>    Lewis' research, conducted in collaboration with Patrick  O'Connor, a UGA assistant professor of exercise science, will be  published in the journal Medicine, Science, Sports and Exercise  this April. In the meantime he plans to study the interaction  between calcium and other minerals with weight-bearing exercise  in determining bone health.</P>

<P>    Still, to confirm his findings about the effect of diet and  athletic training on bone health, Lewis also intends to  investigate the role genes play in determining bone density. By  documenting the bone densities of very young gymnasts and then  following them over time, Lewis plans to establish a baseline  measure of bone density before a girl begins athletic training in  earnest.</P>

<P>    "It may be that young girls who stick with gymnastics to  participate at the collegiate level have genetically denser  bones," Lewis said, "and if so, we need to establish that."</P>

SOURCE: Craig Greene (706) 542-6830</P>

<P>    Fluffy and Fido are getting a bum rap. </P>

<P>    Cats and dogs are often accused of spreading a variety of  diseases to humans. But don't be too quick to blame them. </P>

<P>    "Disease transmission by pets is blown out of proportion,"  said Craig Greene, a UGA professor of small animal medicine. "The  risk from animals is relatively low; people contract infectious  diseases easier from other people than from animals. A person  usually gets the disease from the same place pets do."</P>

<P>    Cats especially have gained a bad reputation for spreading  diseases. Take, for example, toxoplasmosis, which can be fatal to  unborn babies if contracted by their pregnant mothers. Although  cats can spread the disease, most people get it from handling raw  meat, Greene said.</P>

<P>    Fluffy and Fido are actually lending a paw in the battle to  halt the spread of such diseases. Because most pet-transmitted  illnesses cause similar reactions in both animals and humans,  scientists study how diseases affect animals to understand how  they also affect humans.</P>

<P>    Greene uses techniques from molecular biology as well as  antigens, which produce antibodies, and immunoglobulin  concentrations (blood serum proteins that act like antibodies) to  develop diagnostic tests for these diseases. After developing a  test, he produces the infection in dogs and cats to test its  reliability. Next, he applies the test to naturally diseased  animals and studies the results. A reliable test is then used to  determine geographic distribution of the disease and individual  animal infection.</P>

<P>    Worldwide, Greene's tests have helped save lives through  early diagnosis of diseases that previously were hard to  differentiate. "These diseases may be treatable, but they have to  be recognized first," he said.</P>

<P>    Greene also has helped take the bite out of tick-borne  diseases, like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease, by  developing diagnostic tests for both. </P>

<P>    Most deaths from Rocky Mountain spotted fever occur because  of delayed recognition, and consequently, delayed initiation of  antimicrobial therapy. "Rocky Mountain spotted fever is very  confusing to diagnose, and can be fatal if not diagnosed and  treated in time," he said. With Greene's diagnostic test for the  disease, veterinary recognition of the illness has increased,  which in turn has decreased the number of human and animal  fatalities.</P>

<P>    He also has helped put the minds of dog owners at ease by  showing that direct transmission of Lyme disease from dogs to  people is unlikely.</P>

<P>    Also helping veterinary and human clinicians with diagnosis  is the textbook Infectious Diseases of the Dog and Cat. Edited by  Greene and published in 1990, it has become the primary reference  worldwide for these diseases.</P>

<P>    Although his tests may help save lives, Greene said common  sense remains the best weapon in the fight against these  diseases. "People have to be cautious when removing ticks or  handling feces," he said. After all, an ounce of prevention is  still worth a pound of cure.</P>

ENERGIZING MATH & SCIENCE

When a Walton County, Ga., curriculum committee recently convened to select science books for its public schools, Wanda White challenged the members to design a soap carton.

<p>Specific weight and measurement guidelines directed them. And in less than 20 minutes, 30 teachers, school administrators and parents proudly prepared to display their designs.

<p>Instead, White, co-director of the Georgia Initiative in Mathematics and Science (GIMS), asked them simply to list the skills they used during the activity. They came up with dozens, such as writing, multiplying, dividing and sharing --sometimes debating --ideas with a group.

<p>"That is the point of this exercise" said White, also a program coordinator in the University of Georgia College of Education. And that's the point of GIMS, a five-year, $10 million project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) that seeks to improve math and science education in the state.

<p>By bringing renewed attention to how much is learned through even the most simple math and science problems --like designing a soap box --GIMS officials hope to help textbook selection committees in Walton as well as other Georgia counties choose curricula that engage children in this type of learning.

<p>In the same way, the overall GIMS project is designed to help educators statewide find new tools for sharing the wonders of math and science --two subjects that will serve as a foundation for the majority of 21st century jobs.

<p>To increase math and science literacy among Georgia students, GIMS offers a pallet of programs that focus on curriculum development, diversity issues, teacher development and recruitment, and community partnerships for math and science education.

<p><b> Guiding Curricula</b>

<p>The program's "Georgia Framework for Learning Mathematics and Science" may be one of the most important and lasting aspects of GIMS, White said. It's a sweeping document designed to guide curriculum development, instruction and assessment at both the state and local levels. 

<p>The work in progress focuses on things like "habits of mind" --broad-thinking abilities that should be fostered and encouraged in students. The idea is to get students into the habit of solving problems through experiments, innovations and critical thinking.

<p>"Unless we can get students to begin to think like scientists and mathematicians, to experience some of the excitement and joy of problem solving, we are going to lose them" said Michael Padilla, GIMS principal investigator and a professor in the UGA School of Teacher Education. "We are trying to move away from the old  chalk-and-talk' method of teaching, because we realize that kids don't learn very much from that."

<p>GIMS planners originally had intended to review and revise Georgia's current curriculum package --Quality Core Curriculum (QCC) --but soon realized that the process of developing a new framework would be essential.

<p>In developing the document, great efforts have been made to gather input from all aspects of the science and math community: teachers, principals, parents, mathematicians, scientists and representatives from business, industry and government. 

<p>"It's a document based on a combination of research and practical experience --the best of both worlds really" said Charlie Martin, GIMS evaluator and UGA public service associate. 

<p>But the practical side, said Padilla, is one of the primary reasons for the learning framework's growing use around the state.

<p>"Teachers and schools need to feel that this is their curricula" Padilla said. "In order for it to make sense to the teacher and to the kids they're teaching, they have to have that kind of ownership."

<p>This strong commitment to partnership is the key to GIMS' success and is what differentiates the initiative from past efforts to reform math and science education in the state, Padilla said.

<p>The project is headquartered at the UGA School of Teacher Education, but leadership comes from 11 regional centers --each composed of one or more colleges, universities or businesses in partnership with one or more local schools, labeled Professional Development Schools.

<p>"It's exciting because I believe we are changing the system" Padilla said. "It's not the university professor telling the teacher what to do. It's the two of them working together, along with parents, business leaders and politicians, to try to change the old system in Georgia." 

<p><b> An Inclusive Approach</b>

<p> GIMS' initial group effort focused on diversity. "We knew we had to do something related to this because blacks, women, Hispanics and other minority groups are very underrepresented in science and math fields" Padilla said. "So this issue had to come first since it's the one that is woven throughout all the other GIMS programs."

<p>To direct this portion of the initiative, the GIMS team first developed a general document, titled "Diversity: A Framework for Excellence in Mathematics and Science." At the heart of the framework is the written acknowledgment that all children can and should learn math and science.

<p>This may seem like common sense, but the reality is that 13 percent of the total United States' science work force is minorities and 29 percent is women, according to a 1993 NSF survey. In engineering, 14 percent of the work force is minorities and only 7 percent is women.

<p>While many factors contribute to these figures, Padilla said, everyone involved with education --from parents to teachers to business leaders --needs to recognize the subtle biases that may affect whether children embrace math and science or view the subjects as boring, tedious requirements for graduation.

<p>To promote this awareness among teachers, the GIMS diversity document, based on both research and practical experience, advises school districts to invest in professional development experiences where educators can, among other things:

<p>   Examine their own cultural beliefs and behaviors that contribute to classroom biases;

<p>   Gain direct experience in teaching students of different races and socioeconomic backgrounds to   

<p>establish the positive expectation that each child can succeed;

<p>   Observe a diverse group of men and women who are successful in the fields of science and            

<p>mathematics;

<p>   Use a variety of teaching methods designed to meet each  student's learning needs; and

<p>   Observe behaviors that promote or inhibit equitable access to high-quality learning materials and  

<p>technologies.

<p>In line with the diversity framework, several GIMS programs have been initiated to encourage equity in science and math education. For example, Clark Atlanta University supervises Future Teachers of Mathematics and Science --a program to identify, recruit and retain minority high school students interested in becoming math and/or science teachers. Selected students are invited to a six-week residential academic summer camp and then participate in an academic follow-up program throughout their senior year. 

<p><b> Investing in Teachers</b>

<p>Students are not the only ones benefiting from GIMS. GIMS' efforts also focus on teacher education.

<p>"A middle school science teacher in Georgia must be capable of teaching all the sciences --biology, chemistry, earth science, physics, astronomy, marine science" Padilla said. "This is a real challenge."

<p>The challenge is compounded by the fact that the average middle school math or science teacher entering the profession in Georgia is being prepared at a level that is barely adequate or slightly below current professional standards, according to a GIMS-initiated study of preservice teacher education across the state.

<p>To counteract this disturbing finding, GIMS created the "Principles of Educating Teachers" (POET). The goal: to improve middle grades teacher education at Georgia colleges and universities.

<p>Again the format for change began with a set of written principles. But POET quickly moved from paper to reality.

<p>Alice Sampson, a sixth-grade Oglethorpe Middle School science teacher, now shares her practical classroom knowledge with UGA teachers-in-training through hands-on activities and invitations to observe her actual classes well before they have to student teach. The exchange introduces young teachers to the realities of classroom management.

<p>"I was blown away when I taught a lab at UGA one day and at the end of the activity the college students cleaned up everything, sat down and started reading the newspaper" Sampson recalled. "I said,  You can't do that! I've got to show you what really happens. Go get all your stuff and put it back in the middle of the table and start talking.'"

<p>Without practical preservice education like this, young teachers are easily shocked by the behavioral challenges, Sampson said.

<p>POET also has kindled much-needed dialogue among colleges, universities and their main clients --Georgia public schools --about how colleges and universities should prepare middle school teachers. Typically, education majors take science and math classes that are not designed specifically for them but instead for science and math majors. So how do future educators get the broad range of knowledge needed to teach 11- to 14-year-olds? It's often hit or miss, Padilla said.

<p>UGA's College of Education, for example, is responsible for teaching teachers but not for teaching math and science.

<p>"GIMS is trying to forge a partnership with the mathematicians and scientists on campus who teach those subjects" Padilla said. "What kind of science and math do public school teachers need to know and how can we tailor courses to fit those needs?"

<p>The impact of POET on teacher education already is evident. It has been used by more than 20 Georgia colleges and universities to conduct needs assessments and begin revisions of their preservice teacher education programs.

<p>But even with excellent preservice education, teachers are not automatic experts on everything when they receive their college degrees. Which means inservice education is critical, especially in math and science, where technology and its applications change on a daily basis. 

<p>When GIMS provided Sampson's school with several new computers, inservice training was provided on how to use them. 

<p>Outside the schools, teachers can participate in programs such as the Georgia Internship Fellowship for Teachers (GIFT), headquartered at GIMS' Georgia Tech branch. The program combines a summer science- or math-related work experience in research or business with workshops plus formal and informal science networking throughout the year.

<p>These teachers can then take what they've learned back to the classroom and their colleagues. Approximately 1,200 teachers have participated in professional development workshops led by teachers who took part in the GIFT summer program.

<p><b> Lasting Partnerships </b>

<p>In addition to providing invigorating teacher training programs, GIMS is establishing lasting community partnerships that will continue the reform of math and science education in Georgia long after GIMS has ended. 

<p>"(GIMS' staff) are always inviting me to campus and introducing me to so many people and professional organizations that benefit my career and my students" Sampson said.

<p>For example, Sampson and her fellow teachers met a UGA microbiologist who wants to introduce the Internet to 80 students at Oglethorpe Middle School for a research project of his own. This type of networking is precisely why GIMS seeks to establish long-term working relationships between public schools, colleges, universities and businesses.

<p>The GIMS-initiated "System of Support" fosters such community partnership efforts. Relationships with several public and private corporations --including Georgia Public Television, Exxon Corporation and the Georgia Power Company --have enabled GIMS to pilot the latest technologies in interactive distance learning and provide professional development for 750 teachers statewide.

<p><b> Does it Work?</b>

<p>Georgia is among 25 states selected for NSF's unorthodox program to revamp science and math education across the country. Rather than give grants to support individual programs, like POET, NSF decided to risk large block grants to spark creative change.

<p>But are student achievements in math and science really improving in the state?

<p>Because GIMS is, in essence, an out-of-lab experiment, assessment is a challenge. In part, this is due to the large numbers of people involved in and affected by the program.

<p>As of 1995, more than a quarter of a million students from 225 of Georgia's 281 middle schools have been touched by the program. And that's just the middle schools. More than 100,000 elementary school students and 150,000 high school students also have been directly or indirectly involved in the GIMS project.

<p>Adding to the assessment problem is testing. For example, the state's Curriculum Based Assessment (CBA) scores in middle schools showed some improvement in selected GIMS Professional Development Schools between 1992 and 1994. But the tests are designed to assess the state's Quality Core Curriculum; and the tests do not break down individual results for race, gender or GIMS-intensive classrooms.

<p>"It is frustrating, because the National Science Foundation would like to have more data, for instance, related to the achievement gap in science and mathematics between minority and non-minority students" GIMS evaluator Charlie Martin said. "But through the CBAs we can't identify particular classrooms much less particular students."

<p>Martin said he is trying to work around this problem by identifying large minority population schools that have high GIMS involvement.

<p>"If there's a big leap in test scores in those schools compared to non-GIMS schools with a high minority population, that is a measurable result" he said. "But one of the difficulties is that you might have a school that has moderate involvement with GIMS school-wide, but within that school there may be three or four teachers who have been intensively involved.

<p>"If we could get information and data about those particular classrooms we could more adequately describe and learn what's going on and what GIMS' impact has been." 

<p>So Martin and his colleagues are pursuing a host of alternatives to measure GIMS' real impact across the state.

<p>For instance in Clarke County, where the learning framework is being adapted for science education, UGA graduate students have attended all of the planning meetings and are closely following the adoption process.

<p>Some assessment is purely anecdotal. Researchers are continually gathering field observations from the teachers who use GIMS programs every day.

<p>This observational data is in many ways the most telling, Martin said.

<p>"In observing each other, teachers tell us things like,  This is the kind of unexciting things the kids were doing two years ago, and now things are different. The students are engaged, excited. They are doing real science and math,' he said.

<p>The best part of GIMS is that it's an easy program to work with, Sampson said. "There is very little paper work --and that's a big thing. But most importantly we have been able to pick and choose what aspects of the program are right for our school," she said.

<p>For example, teachers at Oglethorpe Middle School were able to identify the needs of their school then turn to GIMS for much of the instructional and financial support to meet those specific goals.

<p>"We encourage teachers and administrators to decide what needs to be done from their professional perspective," Padilla said.

<p>Extensive assessment of GIMS may not be fully possible for 10 or more years. It will take that long for a full generation of students to go from elementary to high school.

<p>"By the year 2000, it will be easier to see the evidence of our success or failure" Padilla said. "But indications point to real change."

<CENTER><H2>A Rising Tide for Georgia Clams</H2></CENTER>

<P> ATHENS, Ga. -- Call  em quahogs, littlenecks, cherrystones or chowders. But whatever
you call them, these shellfish have a future in Georgia, if Randal Walker can do anything about
it.</P>
<P> Hard clams, yet another name for the same critters, are the leading commercial clam
variety in the United States. Walker's clam research has shown that, while clams may never
topple shrimp as the state's top seafood money-maker, quahogs may be an ideal "crop" for
Georgia's coastal waters and an extra boost for the coastal economy.</P>
<P> Clams have never been a big catch in Georgia, although they have been harvested
sporadically since the 1880s. But Walker found that native clams can be harvested profitably, at
least by small numbers of fisherman, despite a 1960s study that claimed the state's clam
population couldn't support commercial clamming.</P>
<P> "The problem with that [survey] was they looked where the clams should have been.
They didn't look where [the clams] were," said Walker, an assistant research scientist with the
UGA Marine Extension Service on Skidaway Island.</P>
<P> Unlike hard clams in the Northeast, which live below the low tide mark, Georgia quahogs
live between the high and low tide marks; they also inhabit small salt-water creeks instead of the
main rivers and sounds. Georgia clams have other ecological quirks, too. For example, they grow
all year instead of hibernating in the winter. And up to 200 of them can live in a square meter --
more than 12 times the density in commercial clam beds in the Northeast.</P>
<P> "We found that the basic ecology of the hard clam in Georgia is totally different than it is
either to the north of us or to the south of us," Walker said.</P>
<P> However, breathing life into the Georgia clam fishery involves more than pointing out
where the clams are hiding. Walker, in research funded by the Georgia Sea Grant College
Program, also looked into the clams' reproductive biology and growth rate. He and his team
found that the clams spawn twice, sometimes three times, each year and that the clams grow to
market size in only two years -- less than half the time of their Northern counterparts -- because
of Georgia's mild winters.</P>
<P> Despite this good news, clams haven't made a big splash in Georgia's seafood industry,
which provides about 4,500 jobs along the coast, for two reasons. Initially, Walker intended
clams to be a winter market for the state's shrimpers -- some extra cash in the off-season.
However, shrimpers can't take their 60-foot boats up the small creeks that the clams call home.
Blue crab fishermen, on the other hand, have the same off-season -- and much smaller boats. </P>
<P> Still, clams didn't catch on with either group, because of the second reason, which has
less to do with desire than with geography.</P>
<P> "Although we have high population densities, the overall area that contains clams is very
small," Walker said. "So it would be very easy for commercial fisheries to go in there and
overharvest everything."</P>
<P> In 1989, Georgia's clam-harvesting area was reduced even further when the Department
of Natural Resources closed two of the most productive areas because of questions about the
leases.  Today, the state's clam fishery only rakes in about $40,000 a year, down from a 1988
peak of more than a quarter million dollars.</P>
<P> Hunting the wild Georgia clam, then, has its limits. But it's not the end of the story.
Because Georgia quahogs grow to market size so quickly, they are ideal for aquaculture. And
because Georgia sea islands have a quarter of the remaining salt marshes in the United States,
many of which are protected as natural preserves, clam farmers are guaranteed plenty of pristine
"farmland."</P>
<P> But raising clams isn't as easy as chucking baby clams into the mud and waiting. In
addition to the research on ecology and growth rates, Marine Extension Service researchers had
to explore questions about the clam's predators, feeding habits and diseases.</P>
<P> Humans aren't the only ones who munch on the low-calorie clam. Whelks, moon snails,
oyster drills, water birds, skates, rays and even some fish such as drums dip into the clam supply
for their diets. But in Georgia, "blue crabs are our worst enemy," Walker said. "You get a blue
crab in there and he eats everything."</P>
<P> Researchers including Peter Heffernan, an associate marine scientist with the Marine
Extension Service, and John Crenshaw, a Georgia Tech biologist, also conducted experiments
using genetic selection to produce clams that grow faster. After only a few clam generations, this
work has produced clams that grow up to 9 percent faster. Heffernan's research into potential
diseases showed that clams are naturally disease-resistant and, in fact, are immune to diseases
that plague other shellfish.</P>
<P> But Walker and his team still needed to find a way to plant and harvest the clams, so they
developed a clever, low-tech operation. On firm creek bottoms, they use gravel-filled,
mesh-topped wood boxes set upon cinderblocks. They would have preferred using inexpensive
sand instead of gravel, but the 10-foot tides tend to wash the sand away "and the whole box just
floats down the river," Walker said. For soft, mud bottoms, mesh bags work better.</P>
<P> The more difficult step is producing the "seed" clams, and this led to another whole set of
research questions. What do clams like to eat? How do you conduct a clam taste test? What sort
of ambience do clams prefer for their all-you-can-siphon buffet? </P>
<P> Commercial hatcheries along the East Coast regularly grow seedlings to 3 or 4
millimeters. However, Georgia clam farmers needed a cost-effective way to grow them to 8 or 10
millimeters -- again, so the tides don't wash them away. Walker began his research using
artificial light in the lab to grow and test various algal feeds for the clams. He found that clams
aren't finicky and will eat the same algae year-round, but they grow better with a variety of algae
in their diet.</P>
<P> But a practical desire for low costs turned him away from the expensive,
temperature-controlled rooms with banks of lights that many seed-clam producers use. Instead,
Walker and his crew designed a greenhouse, which uses old-fashioned sunlight to grow algae and
the young clams.</P>
<P> "Our building is designed to grow the seed to that [larger] size, and then we move that
seed out to the river," Walker said. "At this point, you just can't beat Mother Nature. Nobody
can."</P>
<P> Clam farming can be profitable and may one day catch on; Walker just has to convince
Georgia shrimpers and crabbers to invest in equipment and, for the shrimpers, smaller boats. At
the moment, however, shrimp prices are up, so it's hard for Walker to make his point.</P>
<P> "Georgia is a very traditional fishery-oriented society," Walker said. "Shrimp is king. It
probably always will be.</P>
<P> Clams may not be kings, but with a little luck, some hard work and a growing demand for
pasta with clam sauce, Walker's research may catapult Georgia clams into a league of their own.

<CENTER><H2>Unearthing the Secrets of Worms</H2></CENTER>

<P> ATHENS, Ga. -- This summer, Paul Hendrix is "grunting" for earthworms and looking
for answers in Florida's Apalachicola National Forest.</P>
<P> Kneeling on the forest floor, the UGA soil scientist rubs a car leaf spring across a wooden
stake, creating a curious sound that brings large, pink earthworms wriggling to the surface.
Unlike "baiters" who go grunting to collect fish bait, Hendrix just wants to ask worms a
question: What exactly are they doing to the soil?</P>
<P>  One of a handful of U.S. scientists who study earthworms, Hendrix is conducting a four-year probe on how worms contribute to the soil and to the health of this national forest.</P>
<P> "These worms are very popular as fish bait. People go in there in droves, pull out many
thousands of them a day and sell them," Hendrix said. "The Forest Service is interested in what
effects this may be having. Could there be some detrimental impacts of this on the forest itself?"</P>
<P> No one knows for sure, but Hendrix said he suspects worms are a major factor in
maintaining a healthy soil and, thus, a healthy forest.</P>
<P>  "The soil is our most important fundamental resource. What's going on in the soil is the
basis for everything, whether it's agriculture, forestry or grasslands," said Hendrix, who teaches
in both the UGA Institute of Ecology and College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.</P>
<P> Based on 10 years of worm research funded by grants from the National Science
Foundation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Forest Service, Hendrix knows
worms are important to the biological and ecological processes that keep farm and grassland soils
healthy. In addition to confirming what gardeners have long proclaimed -- that worms contribute
to overall soil fertility -- his research shows they enhance soil structure, reduce erosion and may
help restore soils heavily damaged by plowing and the use of chemicals.</P>
<P> He and his graduate students have found that farming practices can make a big difference
in the number of worms that dwell in the soil. For example, no-till fields -- where seeds are
planted with little or no plowing -- contained more than 500 worms per square meter; plowed
fields, on the other hand, ranged from more than 100 worms per square meter to no worms at all,
depending on the field's condition and how it had been managed in the past.</P>
<P> "When you stop plowing and start using a no-till conservation management system,
things change in the soil," Hendrix said. "For one, earthworm numbers can go very high. The
breakdown of organic material also is much faster where worms are abundant."</P>
<P> Their experiments also established that worms help make essential minerals in organic
matter available to plants.</P>
<P> "It turns out phosphorus and nitrogen are probably the main limiting elements in a lot of
these systems," he said. ""All the nutrient cycling that goes on has been shown pretty well in
agriculture, but it hasn't been shown very well in forestry." </P>
<P> That's why Hendrix and his graduate students are now studying worms and their effects
on nutrient cycling, soil fertility and plant growth in the Apalachicola forest.</P>
<P> "These real sandy soils [in the Apalachicola] don't hold on to nutrients very well," he
said. "These worms could be having some influence on nutrient turnover in the soil and the
availability of nitrogen and phosphorus."</P>
<P> Although the scientists are measuring to what extent worms contribute to healthy forest
soil, they won't have any hard, fast answers for another season or two. Based on preliminary
data, though, Hendrix said he sees no reason yet to be too concerned about short-term reductions
of native worm populations that seem to follow baiting.</P>
<P> Eventually, his research will help the Forest Service determine how much baiting to
permit in the Apalachicola as well as steer long-range management practices aimed at
maintaining the ecosystem's diversity. Those include decreasing the tinder build-up through
prescribed burning, which yields more lucrative baiting.</P>
<P> "The fire is important in keeping these forests the way they are, which in turn creates
conditions favorable to these worms," he said. "The system takes care of itself; the understory
comes back very quickly, and then [the baiters] don't bait in there anymore."</P>
<P> And Hendrix's research may shed light on a bigger issue: the natural history of native
earthworms. Unlike many soils in Eastern United States, which are dominated by nightcrawlers
and other worms from Europe and Asia, Apalachicola soils contain pure populations of native
worm species. Many native worms that tunnel through the soil have yet to be described, much
less studied, said Hendrix, who edited the book Earthworm Ecology and Biogeography in North
America, published by Lewis Publishers.</P>
<P> "There are so many different species of worms around, and they do different things," he
said. "We need to know a lot more about which species are present and what they are doing in
wild-land ecosystems."</P>
<P> Take, for example, worms native to the tall grass prairie. They are better adapted than
their European cousins to climate extremes. Hendrix has reason to believe these and other native
species, including those in Apalachicola, also may be more efficient at nutrient cycling.</P>
<P> And that's why Hendrix spends so much time on his knees on the forest floor. He's
bringing to light worm secrets that now lay hidden in the dark, damp ground.

THE OTHER BOOTH

A father's rejection, the untimely death of two wives and a child, bankruptcy, alcoholism.

<p> And if that weren't enough, renowned 19th century actor Edwin Booth endured the legacy left him by his brother: the infamous assassin of Abraham Lincoln.

<p> That's why John Ammerman chose to portray Edwin's remarkable life not only on paper but also on stage.

<p> "It's the struggle of a human being who encountered tremendous tragedy and overcame it," Ammerman said. "It's about living beyond loss and finding a greater purpose."

<p> The University of Georgia drama professor and Shakespearean actor titled this one-man play Booth, Brother Booth.

<p> "The personal tragedy that this man endured -- as well as his perseverance through it all -- is extraordinary," Ammerman said. "Not to mention that he also became one of the greatest American actors of our history."

<p> The drama revolves around Edwin's destruction of John Wilkes Booth's acting trunk while he reflects on his own life. "I don't see it as a historical journey, but more of a personal story.

<p> "I didn't want it to be a play simply about him sitting down on his chair talking about his life," he said. "It has as much to do about his reputation as an actor and what he performed as it does about what happened to him with John Wilkes and some of the other tragedies that occurred."

<p> As Edwin removes objects from the trunk, they trigger memories. As he burns each item, he wrestles with his family's legacy. For example, in the opening scene, Ammerman shows a link between a play Edwin was performing, The Iron Chest, and Edwin's true-life drama.

<p><i>Where is my honor now? Mountains of shame have piled upon me." I said that. In fact, I contentedly delivered it at the very hour my brother Johnny assassinated Mr. Lincoln.</i>

<p> As the play unfolds, Edwin is reminded of his first wife. He removes a handmade handkerchief they gave his brother and recalls the occasion.

<p><i>Look, JWB. Sewn with great delicacy by my beloved Mary. Mary Devlin -- July 7, 1860. A day I know by heart. It was the day that I married Mary Devlin. It was also the day that Johnny served as my best man, and the day that this -- a blessing from us both -- became the possession of my troubled brother.</i>

<p> Later, he pulls out a costume worn by his father in Richard III, and he ends up talking about working with his father on stage.

<p> "I tried to jump back and forth a little bit for him to fight with his own demons," Ammerman said.

<p> While Ammerman based these and many other scenes on fact, he wove fiction into the story to illustrate the irony of Edwin's life.

<p> For example, Ammerman wrote that Edwin's father died at the same time that he was starting to perform Hamlet. "There's a line in which Hamlet says,  And my father died withinst two hours.' But I fabricated the coincidence in this instance," Ammerman said. Although it's very likely Edwin was performing the tragedy at the time of his father's death, by including this particular element in the play, he said it shows the parallel between Edwin's professional career and personal life.

<p> Ammerman credits his wife Kathleen for bringing Booth's tragic life to his attention.

<p> "She read a biography of Edwin Booth 10 years ago and noticed a strong physical resemblance between Edwin and me, and she kept on prodding me to read about him," Ammerman said. "I finally picked up the biography and was absolutely taken by his life."

<p> Drawing upon a spectrum of experiences -- from classical training as an actor to writing and performing pantomimes and short stories -- Ammerman incorporated famous lines from many well-known tragedies. The Bard's plays figure prominently, with lines from great tragedies, such as Macbeth, King Lear and Richard III.

<p> After finishing the script in September 1994 and refining it the following summer at the Georgia Shakespeare Festival, Ammerman was invited to perform it on the stage of the Globe theater in London. Although the reconstructed theater will not open officially until this summer, Ammerman said he was "thrilled" to receive an invitation during its preliminary season.

<p> "It was an extraordinary experience, finding myself not only inside this [theater] but on stage performing my play," he said. "To find myself reciting  To be or not to be' from Hamlet -- it was almost too much for me.

<P>WRITER: Judy Purdy  (706) 542-5932<BR>
SOURCE: John Stickney  (706) 542-1967</P>

<P>    The shiny, chrome-plated bumpers and hubcaps that graced  vintage cars may ultimately pave the way for a new generation of  microscopic semiconductors.</P>

<P>    A new method of electrodeposition -- the process used to  make chrome bumpers for classic Chevrolet Bel-Aires, Ford  Fairlanes and port-hole Thunderbirds -- may one day yield  microcircuits so small they can be measured by layers of atoms  and so precise they can be used to track exhaust from MiG jets.</P>

<P>    "There has been an elegant method for quite awhile to  electrodeposit compounds, but it tends to result in disordered  and non-ideal material," said UGA electrochemist John Stickney.  "It doesn't have nearly the amount of controllability needed to  form an electronic-grade material."</P>

<P>    So Stickney developed a technique that may make it possible  to electrodeposit materials for a wide variety of electronic  devices, including semiconductors of sufficient quality to  produce optical electronic devices. Such devices could be used in  lasers for compact disk players and fiber optic systems or  detectors for infrared instruments, heat seeking missiles and  night vision goggles.</P>

<P>    "People were depositing materials electrochemically, but the  structures were very polycrystalline -- composed of many small  crystals. There was little control over the resulting structure.  That's where our effort is -- not in making the devices but in  trying to understand fundamentally how to electrochemically form  these materials," he said.</P>

<P>    What's different about Stickney's recently patented  technique is that everything is done on a very controlled and  extremely fine scale. "It all comes down to atoms," he said.</P>

<P>    For the past five years, the associate professor of  chemistry has experimented with ways to alternately  electrodeposit one-atom-thick layers of two or more elements,  such as cadmium and tellurium, to form a compound. His technique,  Electrochemical Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ECALE), results in  compounds that might be useful for many kinds of semiconductors,  such as those found in computers.</P>

<P>    "We do this by depositing two different elements in a one- to-one ratio," he said.</P>

<P>    To deposit one-atom-thick layers, Stickney combines Atomic  Layer Epitaxy -- a chemical deposition process -- with a surface- limited reaction that stops when the electrode surface is  covered. But he and his graduate students encountered stumbling  blocks along the way. For instance, the first cadmium layer would  "peel off" when they tried to deposit a second telluride layer on  top of it. A different tellurium precursor solved their dilemma.</P>

<P>    One application of cadmium telluride is in the formation of  photovoltaics. "Cadmium telluride is perfectly matched to adsorb  the light produced by the sun, and thus has potential to produce  very efficient photovoltaic devices for conversion of solar power  to electrical power," he said.</P>

<P>    ECALE also might have applications in making phosphor  materials, which are essential to developing new high-definition  display systems, such as television screens, for the planned  information superhighway. </P>

<P>    "The United States is trying to advance its research status  in this area and that involves fundamental science, new  technology and a lot of applied work," Stickney said. "We have a  synthesis technique that may be able to form some phosphors  better than other methods and would probably form some phosphors  worse than other methods. We need to find out what it can and  can't do and where it might be able to contribute."</P>

<P>    Stickney's process also is more environmentally friendly.  Others "produce a lot of waste gases that are very toxic and hard  to dispose of," he said. </P>

<P>    His process uses very small amounts of dilute solutions that  are easily recycled. </P>

<P>    "We only need the number of atoms we want to deposit," he  said. "Theoretically, ECALE will cost less since it uses much  smaller amounts of chemicals and the hardware is very simple."</P>

<P>    Unlike other deposition processes, ECALE takes place at room  temperatures, which results in more pronounced boundaries between  different compound layers and, consequently, higher quality  compounds.</P>

<P>    But Stickney isn't content to stop there. He continues to  experiment with various chemicals and surfaces to form thin films  of other new compounds. To date, he has successfully deposited  about 10 compounds. He also wants to find ways to deposit  multilayers and to make thicker films.</P>

<P>    "It's fun stuff, but to make these devices, you have to  improve the quality," he said. "To build a laser or an optical  electronic device, you need very highly structured materials."</P>

<P>    Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but when  teaching, flattery may get you nowhere.</P>

<P>    Research shows that many student teachers disregard the  theories they learn in school and imitate their supervising  teachers instead. "And that may or may not be a good thing," Mary  Leglar said.</P>

<P>    To counteract this tendency, Leglar wants to provide  students with lots of good teaching examples "so they won't take  the path of least resistance," said the coordinator of  undergraduate music education at the UGA School of Music. She  developed two interactive video disc programs that "help students  understand that there are as many styles of teaching as there are  teachers and that certain underlying principals connecting all  teaching," she said.</P>

<P>    To see those principals in action, students observe teachers  in public school classrooms, but students may only get to see a  limited repertoire of teaching techniques. That was one of many  problems Leglar experienced. Others included: scheduling enough  time for observation, dealing with a shortage of master teachers  and school programs for students to observe, and insufficient  funds.</P>

<P>    These frustrations led her to create interactive computer  programs that enable students to see and analyze unrehearsed  clips of teaching techniques from teachers in a variety of  settings around the country --from Indian reservations to inner  city classrooms.</P>

<P>    After amassing and editing stacks and stacks of video tapes,  she recruited many top music educators nationwide to evaluate the  quality, validity and appropriateness of her videotaped examples.  They ran experiments with their own students and submitted their  comments to Leglar who incorporated their changes. She also asked  her colleagues to test the effectiveness of the interactive  component of the program. "Of course, the real research is when I  run my students through these programs," she said.</P>

<P>    Among the music educators around the country who are singing  the praises of Leglar's programs is Eunice Boardman, who chairs  graduate studies in music education at the University of  Illinois. "We plan to use these programs to help students learn  to observe techniques and look for good teaching," she said.</P>

<P>    As for students, preliminary evaluations showed 95 percent  of students liked Leglar's interactive programs -- Music Teaching  and Lesson Planning -- which were developed for the Macintosh  computer with technical assistance from the instructional  technology department of the UGA College of Education. </P>

<P>    UGA Music School Director Ralph Verrastro said Leglar's work  is important because "it's so difficult to train teachers and so  expensive to provide field experience, and these programs take  available technology and apply it to an area where it is really  needed. Her work is making an impact that goes well beyond the  four walls of the classroom."</P>

<P>    Leglar and colleague David Smith of the School of Music plan  to test the programs on their students this fall. She also plans  to follow her students once they get classrooms of their own to  see if they practice the good principles they've learned through  these programs. The research also will continue with the study of  the students of those teachers.</P>

<P>    "If student teachers see many, many styles, they can form  their own style out of that," Leglar said. "There's as much  difference between playing the notes and making music; there's an  equally great distance between holding class and reaching  somebody's mind.</P>

TRANSFORMING GENETIC LINGO
<br>
</font>
<font size=3>
Making Sense of All the Rhetoric
<br>
</font>
<font size=2>

<img src="./rrdna.gif" align=right>
Nobody's perfect -- yet. But with advances in genetics, parents-to-be already can screen "imperfect" genes in their offspring. Perhaps one day, critics charge, parents will choose how to construct a "perfect" child.

<p> Each stride in genetic science brings with it new jargon and perplexing questions: Do the words we use accurately reflect the way we perceive genetics -- and will they ultimately influence the fate of the field in social policy?

<p> To Celeste Condit, a University of Georgia rhetoric professor, one thing is clear: The vernacular already is saturated with confusion.

<p> "People are trying to grapple with all of the new genetic information that research is coming up with," said Condit, who is examining the discourse associated with genetic medicine. "And critics, in many cases, are projecting what genetics means based on faulty assumptions about what it meant in the past and what it means to us now."

<p>  Condit conducted a survey to uncover whether our idea of genetics is more confused today, amid the new scientific verbiage, than it was years ago when such discourse was based on a simpler concept of heredity. To address both, she asked participants to read news reports from either the modern or pre-genetic era and to answer questions that explored their views.

<p> "Today's genetic discourse didn't necessarily reflect a more dehumanizing way of thinking. In fact, it showed people to be less discriminatory. They want  healthy' babies rather than  perfect' ones," Condit said. 

<p>      "I think today's discourse doesn't represent a worse way of talking than we used to have. It may actually be a better way to think about genetics," she said. "It seems to narrow people's focus so that we're thinking about issues of health and the individual, when before we thought about the  gene pool' or  what's best for humanity.'"

<p> In the second phase of her research, currently underway, Condit is examining periodicals from 1910 to 1990 to discover what changes have occurred in genetic discourse during the 20th century. With the help of graduate assistant Melanie Williams, Condit is "coding" key words from newspapers, magazines and journals to determine the number of positive or negative genetic references.

<p> She is finding that words and terms have changed with the times, even though the meanings may have remained basically the same. For instance, where people once used images of "stock breeding" to explain aspects of heredity, metaphors such as "blueprints" show up more often today. 

<p> "I'm really interested in what kind of metaphors show up," Condit said. "There's a big difference in what you call it. A  blueprint' metaphor sounds pretty good in comparison to a  stock breeding' metaphor."

<p> To do a thorough job of research on the rhetoric, Condit began with a crash course on genetics itself. Through the UGA fellowship program, Study in a Second Discipline, she was able to devote the 1993-94 academic year to learn the field's technical aspects. "I worked in a lab doing basic [genetics] projects, learning techniques and understanding what you could do and what you couldn't," she said. "It gave me a foundation on which to build."

<p> She also attended classes on genetics and spent the summer as a visiting investigator at the National Institutes of Health where she observed genetic counseling sessions and doctors' case  conferences.

<p> This training led Condit to realize that, while genetic discourse may be improving, the decisions surrounding it may take a turn for the worse if we fail to implement guidelines. Condit says she hopes her research on what we say about genetics will contribute to what we do about genetics -- and ultimately shape our thinking about how social policy should be formed.

<p> "Advances in genetics will have some impact for everybody," Condit said. "But society will place limits and say  we're not going to pay for this,' or we may even forbid certain kinds of tests: skin color, breast size -- who knows yet. Somehow society will set those limits, but within those limits, individuals will have a lot of choice."

<p> Condit also envisions a fundamental problem arising from any such policy: Who should have the power to create it?

<p> "Obviously, we're very leery about trusting that to the State," Condit said. And although the medical establishment possesses the expertise, it's not necessarily a better choice because doctors have their own biases, she said. And what about individual choice? Condit thinks there are problems with this as well.

<p> "What if it turns out a parent wants a son to be really tall and a daughter short and petite?" she said. "And let's say everybody wants that. All of sudden you have radical gender dimorphism."

<p> Although the science changes rapidly, the issues aren't necessarily new. Condit recalls "a classic case in the  30s" in which a mother forced her daughter to be sterilized in order to negate an inheritance clause that stated the daughter would inherit the estate if she had children.  "So the mother had control, but she wasn't acting in the daughter's best interest," Condit said.

<p> "Height is a common issue," she said. "We already have had trouble with this. There isn't a genetic screen for height, but there's a genetically produced growth hormone. And there have already been cases in which doctors were giving it to people who just had short boys even though the boys weren't deficient in the hormone. The fathers just wanted their sons to be taller."

<p> At the crux of any decision is information, and that is where Condit's research on rhetoric proves essential. "Choice always requires responsibility," she said. "And responsibility requires that you be informed."

<p> Her quest for information is even taking Condit to science fiction, which will be the subject of the final chapter of her book, The Meaning of the Gene, due to be published next year.

<p> "I read science fiction, and then I read the academic scholars. They sounded an awful lot alike," Condit said. "They're projecting the same horror scenario --  genetic super races,'  animal-human hybrids,'  gene wars.' I am going to analyze the science fiction because that's part of what the gene means to us. It means the science; it means the science fiction fears; it means what people actually say; and it means this history of public discourse. So I think if we look at it all, we'll get a well-rounded understanding."

<p> No one knows where all this information will take us, Condit said.  But finding common ground on the meaning of the gene may help future generations make better decisions.

<P>    The African proverb said it best: It takes a village to  raise a child.</P>

<P>    The American problem, though, is that the village is now a  metropolis; American society has grown so much, so fast, that it  has outpaced many of its children. In the rural South, thousands  of poor families struggle to earn a living and raise their  children without the support systems available to their urban and  suburban cousins.</P>

<P>    It's a problem that UGA professors Gene Brody and Zolinda  Stoneman have tackled head-on -- in the families themselves. In  an ongoing, large-scale research project, they're exploring the  ways that rural black families cope with, and overcome,  adversity.</P>

<P>    "We teach many things in our society. One of the things we  don't teach -- or don't do a very good job of teaching -- is how  families work and how to rear children," said Brody, a research  professor of child and family development.</P>

<P>    It's not that social scientists haven't studied the problems  of American families. It's which families they've studied. Most  of the research and recommendations for family-oriented policies  have focused almost exclusively on city dwellers.</P>

<P>    "We've really based a lot of societal interventions on  what we know about middle-class families and predominantly white  families," said Stoneman, director of the University Affiliated  Program for Persons with Developmental Disabilities. "We need to  better understand what the strengths are of rural  African-American families because an intervention is only going  to work if we build on those strengths. If people have not been  studied, then we really don't have a basis for developing  sensitive prevention or intervention programs."</P>

<P>    Until recently, little research had been done on the  specific problems of rural black families. It wasn't until 1992  that agricultural economists Joyce Allen of the University of  Illinois and Ralph Christy of Cornell University compiled their  landmark study specifically about rural blacks. According to  their research:</P>

<P>      More than a million African Americans live in rural areas,  and 95 percent of them live in the rural South.</P>

<P>      Almost 30 percent of two-parent rural black families live  in poverty, more than three times the rate of rural white  families and almost three times the rate of urban black families.</P>

<P>      Their median income is not quite two-thirds of their urban  counterparts and barely half that of rural white families.</P>

<P>      On average, rural blacks are less educated than any other  group and have a higher rate of unemployment; 60 percent work in  unskilled jobs.</P>

<P>    Because of these demographic differences, because of the  differences in family structure -- rural black families are more  often two-parent families and have larger extended families --  and because family researchers "don't know as much about how to  help children of these families," Brody and Stoneman undertook  their project after 11 years of studying white, middle-class  families.</P>

<P>    The first results of their project, which were published in  the May issue of the journal Child Development, trace the links  between financial resources and the academic performance of  children. It's not as simple as it sounds. What they've found so  far is that it's not just the money that matters most.</P>

<P>    "Prior to our work, people would say poverty causes lower  academic performance," Brody said. In contrast, Brody and  Stoneman looked at the ways in which poverty influences family  relationships, which in turn affect children's achievement.</P>

<P></P>

<P> The "Family Process"</P>

<P></P>

<P>    They built their project around systems theory, which holds  that people in a family and the relationships they have with one  another are interdependent: What happens to one influences all  the others.</P>

<P>    Using this idea, they came up with a "family process model"  that describes these connections.</P>

<P>   "We expected that parents who had more financial resources  would be less depressed and more optimistic," Brody said. "We  thought parents with this brighter outlook on life would have  happier marriages, help and support each other more in taking  care of their children and fight less over child-related issues.  We reasoned that, if parents behaved like this, their children  would learn to control themselves. Self-controlled children  would, in turn, do better in school and be better adjusted  personally and socially."</P>

<P>    Although many children who grow up in poverty fare poorly,  not all do. There must be some mitigating factors, and those are  what Brody and Stoneman set out to find.</P>

<P>    Since there was little previous research on rural blacks to  build on, just getting started involved three particular  challenges: how to collect data, from whom to collect it and who  should do the collecting.</P>

<P>    "Not only do we not know very much about African-American  families, but since we developed most of our research instruments  on white families, they're pretty specific -- or at least the  hunch was they might be pretty specific -- to that culture,"  Stoneman said. For this reason, focus groups composed of rural  blacks from around Georgia helped evaluate and re-work existing  assessment tools for the rural black community.</P>

<P>    "It was a collaborative effort of developing our research  methodology between what we knew and what members of the  community knew," Brody said. "All this work paid off because we  were able to develop a battery of instruments and procedures that  is very tight scientifically, and we're getting lots of  requests from researchers across the nation for copies of these  instruments so they then could try to use them with people in  their areas."</P>

<P>    With their research methodology planned, the next step was  to recruit the subjects: 100 two-parent rural families with a  child aged 9 to 12. To locate the families, Brody and Stoneman  went from county to county, getting to know community leaders and  gaining their trust. They visited churches and businesses and  advertised on local radio stations to invite people to  participate. And it turned out people were interested.</P>

<P>    "We were pleased with how eager people were to participate  in this study," Stoneman said. "They were extremely open, and  this was surprising in light of the fact that some people had  suggested that African-American fathers, especially, might be  reluctant to participate in a research study."</P>

<P>    Even with a strong sample of subjects and a scientifically  sound methodology, collecting the data was still a  labor-intensive matter. Research assistants had to visit each  family three times a year. Three hours each time. In the family's  home. And ideally, unlike Brody and Stoneman, they would also be  black.</P>

<P>    "That was, for us, one additional protection against some  cultural difference causing us to miss something or to  incorrectly interpret something that the family either said or  did," Stoneman said. Black undergraduate and graduate students  from departments and colleges across the University of Georgia  campus -- from psychology, law, business, social work and others  -- agreed to join the project.</P>

<P>    "By having black researchers going into black families'  homes, I think we've cut down one barrier," said Chris McCrary, a  graduate student in applied psychology who joined the project as  an undergraduate. "It's just a reality. I think a black family  tends to be more open with another black person coming into their  home than they are with a white researcher."</P>

<P>    It was important to develop rapport with the families, to  put them at ease and to make them comfortable with the research  process, Brody said. "This helped ensure that the family members  would act naturally and respond honestly during data collection,  and made it less likely that families would drop out of the  study," he said.</P>

<P>    Perhaps more significantly, it also helped the families feel  that their participation in the study was important and that  something meaningful would result from it. It was not just  another program being imposed on them by the majority culture,  McCrary said.</P>

<P>    "With all the families I visited, their reactions toward us  as researchers were real positive," he said. "There were even  several instances where families asked us to stay for dinner, or  asked us to come back down on holidays for cook-outs."</P>

<P> Personal Glimpses</P>

<P></P>

<P>    After completing two months of training in data collection  and coding techniques, the interviewers, traveling in male-female  pairs, began the on-site research: They collected information  through reports of the children's school performance, conducted  questionnaires and videotaped families in several group  activities.</P>

<P>    And that's where the Trouble began.</P>

<P>    Trouble with a capital "T."</P>

<P>    The research teams videotaped parents interacting with their  children and each other while playing Trouble, a children's board  game by Gilbert Industries, and discussing their ideas about what  helps children from poor communities to succeed in life. These  discussions were particularly valuable because they provided the  family members' perspectives on the topic being studied.</P>

<P>    Playing a board game may seem an unusual way to collect  data, but for Brody and Stoneman it was ideal. It provided a  casual setting for family interaction -- and it provided a  glimpse of personal interaction that questionnaires alone could  not reveal.</P>

<P>    All the research instruments -- questionnaires and family  activities -- were carefully chosen with the help of the focus  groups. "You have to walk a tightrope, when you do this kind of  work and go into people's homes, between designing a situation  that elicits interaction but is not too threatening so that  people become more guarded," Brody said. "And in our 17 years of  doing this kind of work, one of the things we're convinced of is  that after a while people have a difficult time trying to create  good impressions for the camera."</P>

<P>    The focus groups had warned them that videotaping might  prove too invasive or threatening for these families, but since  no one had actually done it before, they went ahead and tried it,  Stoneman said.</P>

<P>    And it worked well.</P>

<P>    "A lot of the things that we sort of believed wouldn't work,  actually did, and some of the instruments that we thought would  probably do just fine, didn't," Stoneman said. "It's been very  much a learning experience."</P>

<P>    The project's corps of student interviewers has so far  logged more than 70,000 miles visiting rural towns throughout  Georgia. The data they gather on their travels are beginning to  provide answers to Brody and Stoneman's questions. These initial  results describe how financial resources -- or lack of them --  affect children's performance in school. Money itself, it  appears, is not the issue. But when financial pressures place  additional stress on parents, the "family process" often begins  to erode; children can suffer psychologically and educationally  as the stress trickles down.</P>

<P>    "In many families, the parents were more depressed and less  optimistic," Brody said. "When these feelings kept the parents  from being able to work together pleasantly in caring for their  children, the children were unlikely to develop self-control, and  this lack of self-control hindered their achievement in school as  well as their personal and social adjustment."</P>

<P>    But feelings of depression and non-optimism did not always  keep parents from being able to cooperate in caring for their  children, Stoneman said. When the parents worked together to lead  the family in the same direction, the children were more likely  to learn to control themselves and to do better in school.</P>

<P>    "One of the things we know is that couples fight about three  main things: sex, money and kids," Brody said. "So it's very  important for these parents to be going in the same direction in  terms of where they want their kids to go and how they're going  to get them there."</P>

<P>    The researchers were impressed by how well some of these  families functioned despite adversity. Often both parents worked,  and many worked more than one job just to make ends meet.  "Sometimes the parents were passing like ships in the night,  which meant that for their families to work successfully, they  really had to be working together, much more so than middle class  families," Brody said. "And there's enough strain on middle class  families, so you can imagine that the strain increases  geometrically on these families."</P>

<P>    Added to this stress is something that rural families face  more often than do those living in urban areas: They are cut off  from community resources. Although it isn't incorporated into  their research yet, Brody said they intend to show how being cut  off either formally or informally from such resources affects  these families, especially the children, in social development.  Living in isolated areas, children often spend a lot of time on  buses traveling to and from school, and not in activities that  urban children might take for granted.</P>

<P>    "One of the biggest concerns for me, having grown up in one  of these areas, is the lack of programs, things like Boy Scouts  and Boys Clubs, just lots of different after-school or  outside-of-school activities," McCrary said. "Living in a rural  area kind of takes away from having the exposure to the programs  and activities that kids within an urban metropolitan area would  have exposure to."</P>

<P> A Struggle to Succeed</P>

<P></P>

<P>    As Brody and Stoneman continue their research on the  structure of rural black families, they hope to provide  information that social policy makers -- and the families  themselves -- can use to improve their children's odds for  success.</P>

<P>    "It's unrealistic to think that we're going to be able to  provide the financial resources to all the families that need  it," Brody said. "But we can provide resources that at the  minimum assist people with medical and dental care which in turn  creates more healthy parents and children, which makes it a heck  of a lot easier to organize families."</P>

<P>    Relieving such stress could ease the parents psychologically  and, in turn, help their relationships with their kids. And some  changes would require little if any additional money; for  example, inexpensive and informal neighborhood networks can  spread the word about successful parenting techniques and help  families through crises -- helping fulfill the African proverb  about the village raising a child. "There's a hunger for  information in the community as to how to create those networks  and support systems," Brody said.</P>

<P>    But far and away the most beneficial program is already out  there: education. Children eventually become parents themselves  -- and children who stay in school longer become better parents.</P>

<P>    "To the extent we can help kids stay in school a little bit  longer, they will be better parents, and then their children in  turn will benefit," Brody said. "The benefits cascade on an  intergenerational level."</P>

<P>    A more immediate impact of this research may be to shed some  stereotypes about black families, especially about poverty and  the role of the father. </P>

<P>    "We gathered a lot of information that supports a lot of  positive things within the family," McCrary said. "To me that's  rewarding in the sense that, in spite of everything you tend to  hear in the media and through whatever sources, there are a lot  of good things that happen within the black family."</P>

<P>    One example is the perception that most black families are  poor. Although the first results from this project were published  in a special issue of Child Development on poverty, Stoneman said  their families come from a wide range of income levels.</P>

<P>    "Researchers have sometimes recruited people through avenues  that yield them very poor families, and then said, 'Aha! I see  this difference. It must be because these families are  African-Americans,'" she said. "It's very important to  disentangle culture from poverty, and that's something about  which we're taking care in our research."</P>

<P>    Stoneman said she also hopes their study will help dispel  the stereotype of black fathers as absentee parents. Their  research found that doesn't represent a lot of rural black  households.</P>

<P>    "There are many, many African-American fathers who are  extremely committed to being parents and extremely committed to  their families and are tremendously important citizens of their  communities," Stoneman said. "One of the things that I believe  will come out of this work is a strong endorsement of many  African-American men who are extremely competent fathers."</P>

<P>    As researchers learn more about rural black families, it  will be harder for stereotypes such as these to stand. Facts will  replace conjectures, making it easier to help these families turn  their struggles into success.</P>

<P>WRITER: Judy Purdy, (706) 542-5932<BR>
SOURCE: Donna Alvermann, (706) 542-4616</P>

<P>    It's not so much that kids can't read; they don't read.</P>

<P>    "It's the aliteracy -- not the illiteracy -- that's killing  us," said Donna Alvermann, a research professor of education at  the University of Georgia. "The big problem for teachers is  student aliteracy -- the ability to read but choosing not to get  information that way."</P>

<P>    Alvermann and John Guthrie, an education professor at the  University of Maryland, College Park, are among researchers who  recently conducted a nationwide survey to learn what classroom  teachers wanted to know about reading instruction. </P>

<P>    The answer was clear: motivating kids to read.</P>

<P>    "The teachers had many choices on that questionnaire and  they checked over and over again, 'We want help in motivating and  keeping children interested in reading,'" Alvermann said. "It  became very clear that engagement in reading was their biggest  concern."</P>

<P>    With those results and a five-year, $7.7 million grant from  the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Educational Research  and Improvement, Alvermann and Guthrie established the National  Reading Research Center (NRRC) in 1992. A consortium of the two  universities, the NRRC "explores how children develop an  engagement in reading," Guthrie said.</P>

<P>    "There are a lot of kids who aren't very good readers and  they're in a crisis state," he said. "Our job is to build the  tools that others will use to get them out of the crisis."</P>

<P>    The importance of such research also is underscored by how  much daily living relies on reading -- not just at school or on  the job, but even with simple tasks like following a recipe or  programming the VCR. Reading, which is just the beginning of  literacy, is more than decoding words on a page; it's an  interactive process where readers interpret print within their  own cultural and social experiences, Alvermann said. That's why  the NRRC research goes beyond the classroom to include the home- school connection and ways that literacy develops and is  encouraged in the home. </P>

<P>    Three years after the center's creation, the researchers  have come to one hard-and-fast conclusion: Kids who have a  stimulating, diverse reading environment are much more likely to  want to read. When reading engagement goes up, reading  achievement usually follows, they said. </P>

<P>    "Give children choices in the kinds of materials that they  select to find answers to their questions -- magazines, Ranger  Rick, things like hands-on science equipment," Alvermann said.  "The more diverse the materials and the more choices the students  have, the more engaged those children are."</P>

<P>    Their conclusion carries the weight of broad-based studies  that involve 30 university researchers and about 200 continuously  active teachers who represent a variety of culturally diverse  schools, communities and homes in Georgia, Maryland, Texas,  Washington, California, Virginia and New Jersey. In just three  years, the center has funded more than 40 projects involving  about 6,000 students who range from pre-kindergarten through high  school. The studies fall into four broad categories: instruction,  learning, assessment and professional development.</P>

<P>    It all boils down to teaching kids how to use a variety of  resources so they can direct their own learning and find out  about things that fascinate them, the researchers said. </P>

<P>    "For example, third graders who are curious about turtles  can learn to use a book index to find out more about turtles,"  Guthrie said.</P>

<P>    NRRC research also shows that people make good resources.  Parents, for example, can improve their kids' reading engagement  by reading with them or taking them to the library. Low-achieving  students can accelerate their reading and learning with help from  their classmates.</P>

<P>    Computers also are a good resource. One study demonstrated  that young children can use laptop computers to discover for  themselves certain things about the language -- for instance, how  to construct knowledge about alphabetic principles.</P>

<P>    Because classroom teachers are the ones who will implement  research findings and because they are more likely to use results  they find relevant and beneficial, teachers are at the hub of  NRRC research.</P>

<P>    "The teachers are asking some very difficult research  questions and I find myself having to rethink some of the things  I thought were important," said Alvermann, who estimates that as  much as 90 percent of the research involves direct collaboration  with teachers. "That also makes dissemination easier because  teachers don't have to rely on reading a journal article  published 18 months later. They get to use the results of what  they see right then in their classrooms."</P>

<P>    The findings also are disseminated at national and  international meetings and through NRRC-published materials and a  column in the journal Reading Teacher. </P>

<P>    "We want to cultivate highly engaged, self-determining  readers who are architects of their own learning," Alvermann  said. "Reading influences one's sociopolitical views, one's  culture, one's language, one's way of looking at the world.</P>

<P>    "I see reading as a way of transforming people's lives," she  said. "Once someone has learned to read, it opens all sorts of  doors for that individual. We want to discover and document the  conditions in homes, schools and communities that encourage  children to become enthusiastic, lifelong readers."</P>

<P>WRITER: David Hart (706) 542-8808<BR>

<P>    When mathematicians say "big," they mean BIG. Ross Perot's  paycheck? Child's play. After all, you can write down Perot's net  worth in only 10 digits. For mathematicians, the largest known  prime number is really BIG: (2859,433)-1. It would take about 45  pages to write its 258,716 digits. Now that's big.</P>

<P>    When you deal with numbers that big, up in the neighborhood  of infinity, even the seemingly simple questions you asked in  grade school become enormously complex.</P>

<P>    For instance, is a number prime? If not, what are its  factors? A prime number, of course, is a number that is divided  evenly only by 1 and itself, and there are lots of them --  infinitely many, to be exact. The Greek mathematician Euclid  proved this more than 2,000 years ago. If a number has factors  other than 1 and itself, it's called composite.</P>

<P>    Since prime numbers are the building blocks of all other  numbers, it's no wonder mathematicians like UGA's Carl Pomerance  and Andrew Granville spend time pondering them.</P>

<P>    Prime numbers, which Granville studies, are important in  modern data encryption algorithms that can be used to encode  confidential bank transactions. Pomerance, on the other hand,  studies "smooth numbers" -- very composite numbers, so to speak.  They are composites with lots of small prime factors, and they  can be used to crack computer codes.</P>

<P>    "Until recently, smooth numbers were considered little more  than a curiosity," said Enrico Bombieri of the Institute for  Advanced Study in Princeton. "Professor Pomerance has shown quite  effectively that they play a significant role in mathematics."</P>

<P>    "Even though smooth numbers have been studied for a good  part of this century, within the past 15 years they've found a  lot of applications," Pomerance said. "In particular, they've  found applications in factoring algorithms."</P>

<P>    Granville, on the other hand, seeks prime numbers among the  more numerous composites. Granville and Dr. John Friedlander of  the University of Toronto discovered you might not always find  primes where you'd expect.</P>

<P>    The question they posed was: How large a range of numbers  should you look at to be sure it contains some primes?  Mathematicians had agreed on the right size for several hundred  years, so it was a big surprise when in 1985, UGA math professor  Helmut Maier showed that rarely, yet infinitely often (which only  makes sense in the logic of infinity), this expectation was  wrong.</P>

<P>    "It had been thought Maier's idea was very isolated,"  Granville said. "We realized you can apply it all over the  place."</P>

<P>    Granville and Friedlander applied this realization to work  by Bombieri, who was awarded the Fields Medal -- the math  equivalent of the Nobel Prize -- for showing that primes almost  always occur within the expected range of numbers. Since it was  almost always true, no one expected any exceptions. By applying  Maier's idea, Granville and Friedlander proved these expectations  wrong.</P>

<P>    Prime numbers and smooth numbers came together when  Granville, Pomerance and Associate Professor W.R. "Red" Alford  collaborated to solve an 80-year-old problem: Are there  infinitely many Carmichael numbers -- certain composites that  masquerade as primes? There are, the trio proved in 1992. </P>

<P>    "Smooth numbers were used in the proof," Pomerance said. "We  considered prime numbers such that one less than the prime was  smooth. It turns out that if we used such primes, then it was  relatively simple to show that they could multiply together to  produce Carmichael numbers."</P>

<P>    On the heels of that work, they have described how  Carmichael-like numbers can be constructed to trick "lazy"  computer algebra programs. These programs always use the same  conditions to test prime numbers, so it's possible to build  numbers that slip by.</P>

<P>    "What we do is we show that these programs really are junk  -- that in fact, there are numbers that are not prime that those  computer languages will say, `This is a prime,'" Granville said.</P>

<P>    Prime numbers and smooth numbers will come together once  again at this year's International Congress of Mathematicians in  Zurich, where Granville and Pomerance have been invited to speak  about their work.</P>

<P>    "It is very rare to have two speakers in closely related  fields from the same university, and this in itself shows the  high degree of recognition in international circles obtained by  the number theory group at the University of Georgia," Bombieri  said.</P>

<P>    Now, how does all this affect, say, Ross Perot's checkbook?  Not directly, at least not yet. However, you never know when such  basic research will add up to something big.</P>

<P>    "People studied number theory for over 2,000 years just  for it's own sake, and then some idiot goes and makes it  practical," Granville quipped. "And now we're in hot demand and  half our graduate students are funded by the National Security  Agency because they need mathematicians."</P>

<P>    On the farms that dot the island of Mindanao in the  Philippines, something entirely new is happening: Filipino  farmers are talking -- and American agricultural scientists are  listening. It's a new way of doing things for both.</P>

<P>    These farmers and scientists are part of a five-year, $10  million international cooperative research project to devise new  models for agriculture and natural resource management in  developing countries.</P>

<P>    "The natural tendency for scientists is to go in and tell  people what they need," said William Hargrove, a soil scientist  at the Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station in Griffin.</P>

<P>    "We're saying that the main thing needed is for scientists  to show up and listen. Instead of just showing up with money and  all the decisions already made, we're asking the local people to  be active participants in developing a research agenda," said  Hargrove, who directs the cooperative research effort.</P>

<P>    Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development  (U.S. AID) and administered by the University of Georgia, the  experimental project began in the Philippines and has expanded to  the Western African country of Burkina Faso as well as Ecuador.  Researchers plan to extend the work to Morocco, Honduras and Cape  Verde, but the community-centered approach to research should  work just as well back home in Georgia, said Gerald Arkin,  director of the Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station.</P>

<P>    U.S. farmers "have to deal with the same environmental  issues, on a different scale maybe, but it's still the same  principles," Arkin said.</P>

<P>    The "farmers-are-an-important-part-of-the-solution" approach  isn't the only new idea in the Sustainable Agriculture and  Natural Resource Education and Management Collaborative Research  Support Program, which is known by its initials, SANREM CRSP, or  just SANREM for short.</P>

<P>    The program also is unique for its holistic approach to  agriculture research. It weaves the host country's social,  environmental and cultural characteristics into new models of  food production. The results are farming practices that are  kinder and gentler to the host country's landscape, natural  resources and environment -- and more palatable to local farmers.</P>

<P>    Unlike most other CRSP programs, which Hargrove said "are  usually specific to one commodity, like peanuts, sorghum or  millet," the research extends to a variety of food crops.</P>

<P>    To develop such tailor-made models, the project promotes  collaboration among many disciplines. Faculty from American and  host-country universities are putting their heads together with  government officials and community leaders in the participating  countries.</P>

<P>     "The problems are multidimensional, and solving them  requires a multidisciplinary approach, a team approach," said  Robert Rhoades, a UGA anthropologist and member of the SANREM  team. "The age of Lone Ranger research is over."</P>

<P> A Landscape Approach</P>

<P></P>

<P>    The Filipino farmers on Mindanao aren't the least bit  intimidated by the concept of multidisciplinary research. They  simply see it as a way to learn new and better methods of growing  potatoes -- methods that don't denude hillsides or destroy  tropical rain forests, and methods that fit with their culture  and social structure.</P>

<P>    Current farming methods contribute to soil erosion and loss  of biodiversity, said Constance Neely, a soil scientist at the  Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station and assistant director of  the SANREM project. The large amounts of pesticides and  fertilizers the Mindanao farmers use also end up polluting the  water supply, she said.</P>

<P>    That's why the Manupali watershed on Mindanao was selected  as one of the first SANREM sites: It encompasses a number of  important agricultural, ecological and social issues.</P>

<P>    "It's basically a microcosm of the world's environmental  problems," Hargrove said.</P>

<P>    The tropical rain forest that covers the Mindanao mountain  peak at the top of the Manupali watershed is an important source  of biodiversity. It's also home to at least one endangered  species, the Philippine eagle. Although the forest is officially  protected by the government, new farmers are steadily encroaching  higher up its steep slopes to practice slash and burn  agriculture, usually to grow potatoes.</P>

<P>     As the mountain slopes are cleared and planted, soil  erosion becomes more and more serious. Farmers on the lower  slopes and in the river valley use large amounts of pesticides  and fertilizers to grow vegetables, and some of these chemicals  are showing up in the water supply.</P>

<P>    The watershed empties into the large reservoir of a  hydroelectric dam that provides the island's major power source.  Barely seven years old, the reservoir already is rapidly filling  with sediment eroded from the denuded mountain slopes.</P>

<P>    "You have all the typical issues that point to non- sustainability," Hargrove said. "In addition to the environmental  and agricultural problems, you have social issues because this is  the frontier of the Philippines, and many people are moving here  from other islands. So there are conflicts between the migrants  and the ethnic groups that have lived in the forest for so long,  in addition to the pressure that people are bringing to bear on  the natural resources.</P>

<P>    "The typical agronomist approach to the problem would be to  convince these people to grow alternative crops. But it was  extremely clear to us early on that the typical approach was not  going to work," he said. "These people are going to grow  potatoes. It's their biggest cash income. Asking them not to grow  potatoes would be like going to south Georgia and saying, 'You  shouldn't grow peanuts anymore, you need to be growing wheat.'  They're not going to do it!"</P>

<P>    The situation is similar on the other side of the Earth,  where past agricultural practices have squandered the resource  the people of Burkina Faso need most: water.</P>

<P>    In the Burkina Faso village of Donsin, a village typical of  African tropical, semi-arid regions, water is the main  agricultural, environmental and social concern.</P>

<P>    "Both water quality and water quantity are serious issues,"  Hargrove said. "Almost all of the other concerns are related to  water in some way."</P>

<P>    Because women are responsible for collecting water for  household use, water also becomes an important gender issue, he  said.  "In many cases the women have to walk a long way  to  collect water, so they spend a large part of every day just doing  that," Hargrove said.</P>

<P>    And the researchers also have discovered that, just as in  the Philippines, soil erosion and loss of biodiversity are  becoming a problem.</P>

<P>    "The local people have a use for almost every plant, and  some women told us that just in their lifetimes, in the past 15  years especially, many of these plants have been disappearing,"  Hargrove said.</P>

<P> Farmers as a Resource</P>

<P></P>

<P>    If holistic study of the landscape forms the skeleton of  SANREM, then participation of the farmers is its heart. Instead  of prescribing solutions that look logical to American  scientists, the SANREM team listens to farmers' opinions and  involves them in developing solutions.</P>

<P>    "That is really what makes SANREM a new way of doing  things," Hargrove said. "That's the value of working directly  with the people because whatever we come up with will be  acceptable to them."</P>

<P>    In the Manupali watershed area, for example, 33 SANREM staff  spent two weeks canvassing the area, asking people open-ended  questions and encouraging them to talk about what was most  important to them, Neely said.</P>

<P>    "We would talk to whomever we ran into," she said. "We asked  them about how they farm, how they see their environment, what  they remembered about changes and what kind of problems they had.  We didn't want them to tell us just what they thought we wanted  to hear," she said.</P>

<P>    This enabled them to collect "an enormous amount of  information about changes in agricultural practices and the  environment," she said. They also gathered information about  social issues and natural resources, such as when creeks dried  up, when forests started being logged excessively and when a  Philippine eagle was last seen. </P>

<P>    Researchers then invited tribal chiefs, local activists,  government officials, representatives of nongovernment  organizations, farmers and scientists -- more than a hundred in  all -- to sit down face-to-face at Central Mindanao University to  devise workable strategies to tackle the problems.</P>

<P>    "It was a volatile group," Neely said. "We wanted them to  come to a common vision, but we knew we had people whose lives  influenced each other and who had never met and needed to get  their viewpoints aired. And some people had bad feelings about  some of the other groups."</P>

<P>    Take for example, the mayor and Boy Tan, the outspoken  community activist and leader of an agricultural school on  Mindanao.</P>

<P>    "When we first went there, they had never gotten along, and  didn't even speak to each other," Neely said. "But now they're  working on the same committee, and the last story I heard was  that the mayor was actually calling Boy Tan 'my brother Boy.' We  think that's progress."</P>

<P>    After the first few days of airing concerns and complaints,  eight diverse but cohesive working groups started forging  alliances and proposing workable strategies. The results were  compiled by a team of Americans and Filipinos into a document to  guide SANREM research activities.</P>

<P> Forging Solutions</P>

<P></P>

<P>    Potatoes aren't the only thing growing on Mindanao these  days. Fifteen new research projects also have taken root. The  wide-ranging projects, aimed at assessing and preserving the  island's biodiversity, soil and water, include:</P>

<P>    * high-tech computer simulations that model how land use  affects water quantity and quality;</P>

<P>    * non-traditional uses of forest products for medicinals and  handicrafts;</P>

<P>    * installation of weather stations to build a knowledge base  of the island's weather patterns;</P>

<P>    * detailed surveys of the soils, water resources, and flora  and fauna;</P>

<P>    * a study of demographics and shifts in populations that  affect the forest; and</P>

<P>    * improved agricultural practices, including alternatives to  slash and burn agriculture.</P>

<P>    People of all sizes and descriptions have participated --  backyard gardeners, commercial growers, school children and  government scientists, to name a few.</P>

<P>    In Burkina Faso, the SANREM program follows a similar path.  Visiting SANREM scientists talked with villagers whenever and  however they could, even following farmers into their fields to  help hoe and weed. Group gatherings were a favorite among the  African farmers, Hargrove said.</P>

<P>    "They turn things like this into a game," he said. "On one  occasion we were asking about the different things they produce  and sell outside the village. So they would tell us about each of  the different things, like tools made by a local blacksmith and  hoes made by another man, and they would send a child out to  bring back an example, which was laid on the floor in the center  of the group.</P>

<P>    "They would do the same thing when we asked how they  maintained soil fertility," Hargrove said. "When they talked  about using manure, they brought in manure."</P>

<P>    The SANREM team learned that perspectives on problems often  depend on the villager's age, sex and occupation. For instance,  village elders "claimed the major factor in the degradation of  the environment was that the young people don't listen to their  elders anymore. They just like to go to the city shopping and are  out of control these days," Hargrove said.</P>

<P>    Young people, on the other hand, cited drought as the main  cause of environmental degradation and overgrazing as the  secondary cause, he said.</P>

<P>    By airing multiple opinions and sharing multiple solutions,  Donsin villagers already have taken some positive steps to deal  with environmental problems. For example, they mulch the fields  with straw, build stone terraces to reduce erosion and "haul  manure to  the fields from small animals like goats and sheep  that might stay near the house," Hargrove said.</P>

<P> Interdisciplinary Collaboration</P>

<P></P>

<P>    Because of this collaborative approach to research, any  SANREM-sponsored activity must involve American and host country  institutions, and the local farmers and community members must  participate in proposed solutions.</P>

<P>    "No matter how brilliant our technological solutions are, it  is people who have to carry them out," said Cornelia Flora, a  social scientist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute who chairs the  SANREM technical committee. "Often the solutions to problems are  well-conceived, but there are constraints that lie in the social  realm."</P>

<P>    Social scientists help biological scientists understand how  local people see a situation, Flora said. They analyze the  situation and work with the local people to develop ways of  solving problems within those constraints.</P>

<P>    "Gender patterns, for instance, can be an important  constraint," she said. "In the Philippines, the men's caribou  wander freely and eat the hedge rows that women plant and use for  firewood. The hedge rows can be very helpful in preventing soil  erosion, but first we have to deal with the question of providing  food for the caribou. This is a problem that might not have been  identified by scientists just looking at the hedge rows alone."</P>

<P>    In the past, "little attention has been paid to outside  influences that affect the farm or the farmer _- or the reverse,  to the impact of agricultural activities outside the farm, such  as pesticide runoff or soil erosion," said Ron Carroll, associate  director of the University of Georgia's Institute of Ecology,  which was instrumental in developing the concept of a "landscape  approach" to agriculture research.</P>

<P>    At the center of this worldwide web of agricultural  information lies the Griffin, Ga., home of the Georgia  Agricultural Experiment Station, where Hargrove and Neely  maintain contact with their far-flung researchers.</P>

<P>    "It sounds good in theory to create a consortium like this,"  Hargrove said. "But it's not easy at all. As a scientist, it was  so much simpler when I was just working in my lab. I didn't have  to contact 20 other people before I made a decision."</P>

<P>    After the Manupali watershed was chosen to be the first  SANREM site, Hargrove and Neely began putting together a network  of organizations and individuals. Assembled under the SANREM  umbrella are tribal councils, farmer groups, community members,  and representatives of government and private agencies, not to  mention scientists from more than a dozen universities and non- government organizations. It more closely resembles the diversity  of a Philippine rain forest than the monoculture of a Mindanao  potato field. And SANREM's board of directors and technical  committee include scientists from nine universities (Auburn,  Colorado State, Tuskegee, UGA, the University of the Philippines,  the University of Wisconsin, Virginia Tech, Washington State and  Western Carolina) and five international research centers.</P>

<P>    "It takes a lot more time to do things this way, and it can  be frustrating for everybody involved," said Jim Bonner, SANREM  project officer for U.S. AID. "But we believe that the benefit  will be a final solution that is much more in tune with what the  local people need."</P>

<P>WRITER: David L. Hart, (706) 542-8808<BR>
SOURCE: Robert Golembiewski, (706) 542-2057</P>

<P>    If one in five adults around the world suffered from the  same disease, it would be worse than an epidemic or even a  pandemic. More on the order of a plague.</P>

<P>    Yet, on average, more than 20 percent of working adults  suffer from the highest level of on-the-job burnout, according to  research by Robert Golembiewski and his international team.</P>

<P>    "If this were a physical disease, there wouldn't be a word  for it," said Golembiewski, a University of Georgia research  professor who specializes in public administration and  organization management.</P>

<P>    The worst levels of burnout appear in Japan, where nearly 60  percent of employees in three studies by Golembiewski and his  colleagues fell into the highest category -- Phase VIII on an  eight-phase scale.</P>

<P>    Overall, in numerous studies including 40,000 individuals  from several countries, more than 40 percent fell into the three  most advanced phases of burnout. Even in the healthiest  organization Golembiewski studied, 22 percent of employees  reported being in the three highest phases.</P>

<P>    "A little stress is good for people -- it can energize them  and motivate them. Too much stress is not good for them. The  question is 'Where is the point beyond which stress herniates  rather than motivates?' " said Golembiewski, who has written more  than 500 articles and 50 books and has received the top awards  from the Academy of Management and the American Society for  Public Administration for his work.</P>

<P>    Golembiewski's phase model of burnout is an effort to  identify that point. Social scientists generally agree on three  components of burnout, which the phase model ranks in increasing  order of harmfulness:</P>

<P>    * a high degree of "depersonalization," in which a person  thinks of others as objects and keeps them at a distance;</P>

<P>    * a lack of personal accomplishment, exhibited by employees  who report they are doing poorly and believe their jobs are not  worth doing; and</P>

<P>    * high emotional exhaustion, which is shown by people who  can no longer comfortably cope with the stressors they are  experiencing.</P>

<P>    "A lot of statistical work has established that those  bundles of activities make sense to people all over the world,"  Golembiewski said. "People working in high-tech organizations  respond similarly to those items, whether they are Americans,  Chinese, Japanese, Poles or Russians." </P>

<P>    Golembiewski uses a 25-question survey, the Maslach Burnout  Inventory, to measure how a person is dealing with stress at  work. The survey ranks a person as either high or low in each of  the three components, for a total of eight phases. In Phase I, a  person is low on all counts; in Phase VIII, the person is over  the edge on all three scales.</P>

<P>    So far, Golembiewski and his colleagues have compared  burnout levels to more than 300 variables, and the results all  point to the same conclusion: Among other things, a person's  self-esteem, productivity, family relationships, mental health  and physical health all suffer as burnout gets worse.</P>

<P>    "We focused on 19 symptoms that went all the way from sweaty  palms to heart pains," Golembiewski said of one study on physical  health. "From relatively trivial manifestations to relatively  serious ones, the pattern was the same." A person in Phase VIII  has five to 15 times the physical health problems of the average  American, whereas a person in Phase I has one-fifth the symptoms  of that average American. And although the numbers may vary, the  same pattern holds for other countries.</P>

<P>    The results also reveal some trends about how often and how  easily people move from one phase to another. For one, burnout  tends to stick. If you're in Phase VIII, you're likely to stay  there; for that matter, if you're in Phase I, you're likely to  stay there, too.</P>

<P>    On the other hand, once you slip out of Phase I, get ready  for an accelerated trip to Phase VIII.</P>

<P>    "The moral of that story is, keep everybody in Phase I as  much as you can," Golembiewski said, "because once you go beyond  Phase I, there's a very slippery slope."</P>

<P>    A worker probably will not go through each of the eight  phases in order, he said. In "chronic onset," a person gradually  progresses to high levels of each component. In "acute onset," a  person jumps suddenly to higher phases because of some trauma,  perhaps a death in the family or layoffs at work.</P>

<P>    The best an individual can usually do is inoculate himself  against burnout. According to Golembiewski, meditation, big- muscle exercise, and hobbies are some other ways to reduce  stress. Withdrawing from work is another, less constructive,  route to take.</P>

<P>    The only sure-fire cure is never taking that first step  toward depersonalization, which is easier said than done.</P>

<P>    "Make sure that you're listening to people and people are  talking to you," Golembiewski said. "That's a very simple thing  to say, but it's a very important one from the point of view of  our model. If you're in Phase I, that's how you avoid Phase II."</P>

<P>    Even though Golembiewski has figured out what's causing so  much burnout, he's up against well-entrenched opposition when it  comes to reducing these "tragically high" levels.</P>

<P>    That's because most organizations worldwide use the  relatively standard bureaucratic management structure -- the very  one which seems to cause burnout. That structure along with  traditional supervisory practices combine to push people over the  edge.</P>

<P>    "Just think of Captain Queeg the paranoid captain in The  Caine Mutiny or somebody like him, and you've got a stereotype  of the person who generates VIII-ism," he said. "The sad thing is  most supervisors are trained to behave that way. On the other  hand, if the organization is willing to modify its practices,  there are very straightforward designs that reduce burnout."</P>

<P>    Such changes could add up to big payoffs for companies and  individual workers.</P>

<P>    "One objective indicator that should get the eye of  management is that employees in Phase VIII use much more medical  insurance than those in Phase I," he said. "It's predictable from  the findings on physical symptoms and mental health, but it also  shows up in dollar costs."</P>

<P>    Instead of changing the way they do business, managers and  organizations often prefer to "immunize" their employees against  burnout -- for example, with stress reduction workshops. However,  it's often the wrong people who attend. Ideally, work teams  should be going, but management generally sends individuals, and  people in the most advanced phases of burnout seem unlikely to  sign up.</P>

<P>    "Most American executives are willing to pay lots of money  for individual magic pills," he said. "If we could sell them  something that would reduce stress in individuals, we'd be  multibillionaires. What we tell them is something very simple:  There is no such medicine. The medicine is to change your  policies and procedures, especially at the supervisory level, and  they often don't want to do that."</P>

<P>    If organizations keep the same policies, they do so at their  own risk. Employees don't want to stay in organizations that burn  them out, but they may have few options.</P>

<P>    "When the economy improves, and people feel that they are  freer to move, we're going to have huge dislocations,"  Golembiewski said. "And if we don't have the opportunity for  people to move, then there's a lot of social dynamite building in  organizations."</P>

<P>    Golembiewski's research paints an almost tangible picture of  this explosive concept. It's not just a general feeling of being  at the end of your rope. It's something specific, persistent,  widespread and harmful.</P>

<P>    "It's no wonder many people don't like their work, because  we're saying 40 percent of them feel dumped on more or less  regularly," he said. "Now as a society we either tolerate that,  or we don't. I'm working on this because I don't think we can  tolerate it in the long run."</P>

<P>    It's not quite like the days when slaves built the pyramids  at the business ends of the whip and lash, but organizations  still have a long way to go, he said. It's going to take some  strong medicine to get us all there.</P>

<P>    "I can't give everybody a pill," he said. "I wish I had one.  The indication is a lot of people need help, and so do their  organizations."</P>

<P>WRITER: Judy Purdy, (706) 542-5932<BR>

<P>    Out of sight, out of mind. That's the fate of some knowledge  as cultures around the globe shift from centuries-old farming  methods to modern, commercial ones. Gradually people are  forgetting the flavorful fruits, vegetables and grains of their  youth.</P>

<P>    That kind of know-how is something UGA anthropologist  Virginia Nazarea-Sandoval wants to preserve.</P>

<P>    "When I was doing my dissertation in 1987, I realized that  farmers in their 50s and early 60s living in rural Philippine  villages no longer knew anything about the traditional rice  varieties," she said. "They would be nostalgic, for example,  about the aromatic varieties that they liked but the people  didn't know whether the rice varieties they wanted still existed.  Even if they had had access to seeds of these old varieties, they  would have had very little idea about how to plant them or grow  them, and these were not exactly young farmers."</P>

<P>    The problem is not confined to the Philippines, as she  points out in her book, Local Knowledge and Agricultural Decision  Making: Class, Gender, and Resistance, due out this year from  Cornell University Press. Technologically sophisticated  agricultural practices fill the world's bread baskets, but not  without a price. They crowd out simpler methods, deplete the rich  variety of alternative crops and empty vast stores of knowledge. </P>

<P>    Gene banks -- repositories of seeds, roots, and other plant  parts used for conservation, propagation and breeding -- help  stem the erosion of genetic diversity. But gene banks focus on  collecting, documenting and preserving well-known cultivars,  obscure folk varieties and wild relatives of such crops as corn,  rice and potatoes, while giving little or no attention to farmer  knowledge about those crops, Nazarea-Sandoval said.</P>

<P>    "Gene banks contain 'passport' data -- very bare-boned  information like where and when the plant was collected. There is  no systematic collection of cultural data," she said.</P>

<P>    Nazarea-Sandoval wants gene banks to augment their  collections with "memory banks" that preserve farming knowledge  accumulated over many lifetimes.</P>

<P>    "I would like to document the knowledge of the older  generation of farmers before they pass on, in a way that will be  useful to anthropologists, plant breeders, other scientist and  the local people," she said.</P>

<P>    Memory banks also preserve farming alternatives. If  agriculture in developing countries, for example, would suddenly  need to revert to low-input, pre-Green Revolution times, memory  banking would offer other choices. </P>

<P>    "Development is ideally something that one chooses,"  Nazarea-Sandoval said. "Memory banking simply says that there are  options available, that people survive and obtain a certain  quality of life if they recognize their options. It's  particularly important for third world countries because they do  not control resources and have little control over global markets  or political situations."</P>

<P>    To develop a method for memory banking, Nazarea-Sandoval  spent 16 months working with inhabitants of two Philippine  villages -- Intavas and Salvacion -- collecting and preserving  their indigenous knowledge and memories of sweet potato  cultivation. </P>

<P>    "Memory banking is not something you can do with a survey.  You can't use a fixed questionnaire that you just ask people to  answer," she said. "People keep things in their memories that  don't exist anywhere else anymore. What I tried to do was to  tap around those memories with different methods in anthropology.  We would sit down and talk about their lives and they would  recall, for example, the varieties their parents cultivated,  those they liked, what they did with them."</P>

<P>    To understand what qualities the villagers valued, she gave  them groups of sweet potatoes to sort.</P>

<P>    "They could say varieties X and Y are both sweet, whereas  variety Z is bland or varieties A and B are dry, whereas C is  wet," she said. "If you do it over and over again with different  random combinations, you are able to map the way a person or a  culture thinks about a certain domain and which features were  most important."</P>

<P>    In addition, this allowed Nazarea-Sandoval to see  differences between commercial growers and subsistence farmers,  men and women, and members of different ethnic groups.</P>

<P>    She also asked her informants to draw pictures of sweet  potato varieties from memory. Their drawings and  characterizations were placed in the memory bank back-to-back  with scientific drawings and characterizations.</P>

<P>    In all, Nazarea-Sandoval documented knowledge of 89 sweet  potato varieties.</P>

<P>    "The dream is that we will be able to input the name of a  local variety into a computer and then call forth all the data --  the life experiences that correlated with that variety, the  informants' drawings and the agricultural technologies," she  said. </P>

<P>    In the meantime she is refining memory banking protocol at  the UGA Ethnoecology/Biodiversity Laboratory and completing  another book, Cultural Dimensions of Biodiversity, solicited by  the University of Arizona Press. She also works with other  scientists, gardeners and commercial growers to develop memory  banks that will preserve indigenous know-how not only in  developing countries but also here in the Southeast via a  Southern seed legacy network.</P>

<CENTER><H2>Ancient Voices Speak Again in Carthage</H2></CENTER>
<P>WRITER: Judy Purdy, (706) 542-5932<BR>
SOURCE: Naomi Norman, (706) 542-2187</P>

<P>    What started out as a road in modern Carthage has become an  archaeological excavation of a 2,000-year-old cemetery.</P>

<P>    "It was a strange and crazy series of accidents," said  archaeologist Naomi Norman, the UGA classics professor who  directs the dig.</P>

<P>    First there was the bulldozer Norman held at bay for six  hours.</P>

<P>    "I stood in front of the bulldozer and said, 'You can't  churn up any more.' Then I called the Tunisian authorities to get  them to come down to at least see what was being churned up,"  Norman said.</P>

<P>    Then there was the marble charioteer. Exquisite in form and  still in mint condition almost two millennia later, the life-size  portrait statue had been scooped up with roadbed rubble by an  earlier bulldozer. And as yet, hardly anyone knew of its  existence.</P>

<P>    "It's one of the most beautiful statues discovered in  Carthage in the past 100 years. It's really a spectacular piece  of art," Norman said.</P>

<P>    And there was the necropolis itself -- a large and elaborate  cemetery in the ancient city of Carthage. Although Norman had no  way of knowing then that numerous architectural structures stood  intact under an accumulation of centuries of soil and decades of  modern-day trash, the archaeologist was lured by the site's  possibilities.</P>

<P>    "I was really interested in that site because I was  excavating the Carthaginian Roman Circus -- that's where  charioteers did their thing," she said. "And the statue would  have been a perfect thematic tie."</P>

<P>    Norman planned to conduct a three-week probe of the  necropolis in 1992 and then move on to excavating a house she had  been eyeing. Instead, the well-preserved cemetery, located only a  stone's throw from the circus, turned out to be what she called  "a spectacular site, a real plum."</P>

<P>    "In about two weeks it became clear that this was a major  cemetery site and we could spend the next 20 years there if we  wanted to," she said. "We had a lot of questions about how they  were buried and what kind of rituals took place, and this site  gives us the opportunity to answer those questions, to apply  scientific methodologies and to excavate the cemetery to get the  maximum amount of information out of it."</P>

<P>    It's not just the large size of the cemetery, the prominence  of the people buried there or the discovery that it was used  continuously for almost six centuries that makes it significant.  The cemetery is in remarkably undisturbed condition, especially  considering it survived an earthquake and at least one major  stone robbing. And no other Carthage cemetery of its type has  been excavated scientifically.</P>

<P>    But the most important aspect of the necropolis excavation  may be its impact on helping people understand the importance of  archaeology.</P>

<P>    "I think the most important thing is simply the fact that  we've got Roman architecture still standing," Norman said. "Most  people find it very difficult to understand a site that no longer  exists. So this gives us an important datum point for people to  look at, to feel and touch something real from second century  Carthage."</P>

<P>    The enormous quantity and well-preserved quality of material  being excavated promises to rewrite the artistic, social and  cultural history of Carthage. Archaeologists also will be able to  integrate and contextualize the material from the cemetery with  that from other sites in the ancient city, said Norman, who  directed the excavation of Carthage's Roman Circus from 1982 to  1990.</P>

<P>    So far, Norman and her 30-member team of students,  volunteers, Tunisian workers and professional archaeologists have  unearthed a large volume of antiquities from the necropolis. In  addition to marble statues, a mausoleum and several tomb  monuments, they have dug up a wide assortment of funerary  inscriptions, coins, pottery, cremation urns and skeletons, which  paint a complex picture of life and death in ancient Carthage. By  the summer of 1994, they also had amassed enough data to  reconstruct the site's history and relate its location to the  circus and the amphitheater, two major public entertainment  buildings.</P>

<P>    But before the crew could begin excavation, Norman and a  handful of Tunisian workers had to clear away a mound of modern  rubbish. Since the early 1980s, the site was used as a garbage  dump for the modern-day Carthage suburb of Yasmina. In addition  to the dump, local farmers had constructed an animal pen using  the large limestone building stones that once had been the  foundation of a third century mausoleum.</P>

<P>    "I was really shocked when I first got there and took a look  at that pile of garbage," she said. "It was like everybody's  worst nightmare. I just was not sure I could ask students to  excavate this. I went out there with a bunch of pretty  spectacular Tunisian workmen and within four days we had cleared  off much of the modern trash -- old iron beds, coils for  mattresses, lots of vegetable matter."</P>

<P> Relics Rewrite History</P>

<P></P>

<P>    Once the site was cleared, the crew began the laborious job  of unearthing large architectural structures with picks and  shovels, under the blazing equatorial sun. Dental picks and  cotton swabs were the tools of choice for the more delicate and  often tedious work of scraping away layers of time from coins,  skeletons, glass bowls and stuccoed reliefs.</P>

<P>    The fruits of their labor may help rewrite sections of the  history of the Roman Empire. For instance, of the thousands and  thousands of Roman coins unearthed in Carthage excavations, the  overwhelming majority had been minted in the East, in places like  Syria and Turkey. That is until Norman and her crew came on the  scene. They found several bronze coins that were minted in Gaul,  and that pocket change is expanding our current knowledge of  Roman economics and changing maps of third century trade routes. </P>

<P>    "We certainly didn't expect to find anything new about  coins. I was really shocked and delighted when my coin  specialists told me about these really important third century  coins from Gallic mints," Norman said. "Coins we're producing  from this site are changing the scholarly picture of the  monetization of Carthage and suggesting new trade patterns and  new economic patterns for Carthage which we hadn't thought of  yet."</P>

<P>    Often in archaeology, simple, everyday items like coins lead  historians and mapmakers to make major changes. For instance,  funerary inscriptions, which help fill out family trees of  important Carthaginians and provide insight into daily life, also  have an important role to play. One inscription in particular,  that of 60-year-old Quintus Iulius Felix, simply reads "a  veteran," but it may mark the grave of one of Carthage's  founders.</P>

<P>    "The letter forms and the absence of certain formulaic  expressions suggest it's a late first century inscription,"  Norman said. "And it was found in a tomb with scrolls on the top  surface, which also indicates the tomb dated to the late first or  early second century. I think what we've got here is the tomb  perhaps of one of the first founders, one of the settlers of  Carthage." </P>

<P>    The Roman colonists who settled Carthage during the first  century were veterans -- soldiers who had fought for Augustus and  were rewarded with land in this new province.  </P>

<P>    The inscription also implies that Carthage covered a larger  area than scholars had originally thought. Roman citizens tended  to put their cemeteries in conspicuous places where they would be  seen; this one is located just outside the city's south gate, on  the route to the Roman Circus, which would hold 70,000 people.</P>

<P>    "If you're placing a cemetery in this area, that means there  is occupation in this quadrant of Carthage at that earlier  period," Norman said. "It's a mark of status to have your tomb  right on the road. As people are going in to town they will see  your funerary monument and will perhaps stop and read your  funerary inscription, read all about your glorious life, and give  you a certain measure of immortality. So you like to be buried  near places where people go."</P>

<P>    And that's why the charioteer statue seems very much out of  place in this cemetery, which was used by some of the city's most  prominent, high-status citizens during the first through third  centuries. Funerary monuments and statues, usually commissioned  by the deceased before death, were a type of propaganda, a  complimentary image portraying the deceased at the prime of life.</P>

<P>    Roman charioteers, who often were slaves or ex-slaves, were  considered very low-status individuals. Some became "fabulously  wealthy, popular celebrities" who could buy their freedom, but  despite their success, they could never break social class  barriers, Norman said. Even so, many tried to disguise their  charioteer past and pretended to be something they were not.</P>

<P>    "The charioteer is an interesting sociological study in and  of himself," she said. "This guy is not trying to hide who he is  but really seems to revel in it. Instead of commissioning a  statue that shows him as an aristocratic man of leisure, he shows  himself as a charioteer. And he chooses a burial ground that is  literally within eyesight of the Roman Circus so people going  into the circus on game days to watch the chariot races will file  past this cemetery and see his statue."</P>

<P>    Circus-goers would have been hard pressed to miss the  charioteer statue. After all, it was part of an expensive,  elaborate mausoleum. The statues of the charioteer and his wife,  which was found in 1992, would have stood in two niches in the  mausoleum's exterior walls, which were partially destroyed by an  earthquake later in the sixth century.</P>

<P>    Like her husband, she holds an implement used in funeral  rituals in one hand and a professional implement, a round object,  in the other. Norman speculates the object is a ball of yarn  since a typical epitaph for a Roman matron is "she made wool."</P>

<P>    "The statues are perfectly complementary toward one another;  you've got an implement for funerary ritual in one hand and a  professional symbol in the other. What's really interesting is  that the ball of yarn is her professional badge in the same way  that the whip in her husband's hand is his professional badge,"  Norman said.</P>

<P> Clues to Burial Rituals</P>

<P></P>

<P>    In addition to the mausoleum, the crew has found a number of  smaller tomb monuments built in the first through third  centuries. Several have solid rubble concrete cores and white  stuccoed exteriors. In others, the interior walls contain niches  that still held cremation urns placed there nearly two millennia  ago. Many are decorated with reliefs that depict scenes of daily  life among the deceased.</P>

<P>    For instance, scenes on the Tertullus/Vibius family tomb, a  three-story monument that may date to the late first century,  show activities typical of an aristocratic family. They also  depict pigs trotting across an abstract landscape, an animal with  cloven hoofs -- which may allude to the aristocratic penchant for  boar hunting -- and men galloping on horseback. </P>

<P>    "It's tempting to speculate that family members who erected  the monument were professionally involved in horse breeding,"  Norman said.</P>

<P>    But neither pigs nor horses caused as much speculation or  excitement as the mysterious animal that the excavation slowly  revealed in the funerary relief for Marcus Vibius Tertullus.  Tertullus is seated in a highback chair reading a papyrus scroll  unrolled on his lap, and some sort of animal stands at his feet.  At first, all the excavators could see was the animal's tail and  a hind paw. </P>

<P>    "There were raging debates on what kind of animal this was.  Was it a dog? A lion? I was sure it was a dog, and the field  director was sure it was a lion," Norman said.</P>

<P>    Actually, it was much more symbolic. The tail and paw  belonged to Lupa, the legendary she-wolf that suckled Romulus and  Remus, the founders of Rome. The twin boys also were depicted on  the relief.</P>

<P>    In addition to giving glimpses into daily life in Carthage,  the cemetery answers questions about ancient burials and funeral  rituals, such as when Carthaginians changed from cremation to  interment. For example, the vaulting tube monument, which was  excavated last summer, confirms scholars' age-old assumption that  Romans offered libations to the dead.</P>

<P>     "We knew that the vaulting tube monument was very different  from the other tombs at the site because most of them are solid  structures," Norman said. "This small tomb was hollow inside. It  had a door and a vaulted room, but we couldn't excavate it for  the longest time because it had a huge crack that ran up the  middle of it. If we took the fill out of the interior we thought  the whole thing would fall down."</P>

<P>    After two years their mounting curiosity about this unusual  tomb was satisfied when conservator Tom Roby stabilized the tomb  so excavation could proceed. In addition to the niches for  cremation urns, the crew found a rectangular receptacle with a  tube inserted into a small hole.</P>

<P>    "That was very exciting because literary sources talked  about how family members would go back to cemeteries on various  anniversaries and pour libations and do certain other rituals in  honor of the dead," Norman said. "We think we have clear-cut  evidence that they were walking inside this tomb and pouring  libations in this little tube down into a cist a rectangular  receptacle in the wall in honor of all the family members who  had been buried there." </P>

<P>    The crew also has discovered an area of the cemetery  reserved for the burial of small children, which may help  corroborate the assumption that Roman children held a peculiar  social status.</P>

<P>    "It seems clear that the practice of burying small children  in separate areas away from older children, juveniles and adults  could reflect a Roman status distinction," Norman said. "This  practice probably arose from the fact that fully half of all  children in antiquity died before the age of 5."</P>

<P>    Remnants of a structure found by crew members in another  part of the cemetery could contain evidence of Christian burials.  So far, they have excavated a wall that Norman speculates may  have been part of a church associated with the cult of a local  Christian martyr, St. Perpetua. The discovery might also explain  why Carthaginians went to the trouble of restoring the cemetery  to usable condition following the catastrophic earthquake in the  sixth century.</P>

<P>    But many secrets of the Roman Empire's third largest city  may remain buried in the Carthage cemetery for many years to  come. That's because archaeological digs are very expensive  undertakings. </P>

<P>    "Tunisia is a poor country," Norman said. "They are very  interested in preserving this part of their heritage and the  Tunisian Institute of Art and Archaeology has been very  cooperative, but Tunisia doesn't have the money for this kind of  work."</P>

<P>    Funding for Norman's research, which comes from the  University of Georgia, the Kress Foundation and the Polaroid  Corporation, runs out this summer. "If we can't excavate anymore  then I want to raise the money to build a site museum so we can  keep this site open and accessible to the public so visitors can  see this very important Roman period. We have actual monuments  that people can walk around in," Norman said.</P>

<P>    If she is unsuccessful, the site will be covered over to  preserve it and "squatters will move in and plunk their houses  down on these monuments and that will be it," she said. "This  spectacular site will be gone forever." </P>

<P>Research and the Family</P>

<P>    More and more often these days, as Dean Sharon Nickols  writes in this issue's "Viewpoint" column, "the bonds of families  in every nation have been tugged and stretched by tremendous  social, political and economic pressures. More and More families  are having difficulty providing adequately for the needs of their  members, especially their children."</P>

<P>    That's why we've chosen this issue -- during the United  Nations' International Year of the Family -- to spotlight some of  the many family-related research projects at the University of  Georgia.</P>

<P>    For instance, in a large-scale study of poor rural black  families, social scientists Gene Brody and Zolinda Stoneman are  identifying the pressure points that place some families at risk.  They've also found some very encouraging signs for the future.</P>

<P>    Building the future for entire communities is the aim of a  project by an international team of scientists led by William  Hargrove and Constance Neely. With a $10 million grant from the  U.S. Agency for International Development, the research is  helping families in developing nations adopt agricultural  techniques that harmonize with their environments.</P>

<P>    Deborah Godwin's ongoing study of newlyweds suggests that  attitudes are more influential than assets when it comes to  financial satisfaction. And in Denise Park's psychology research,  nearly a decade of studies that involve the elderly reveals  important results about how memory affects the way patients use  prescription drugs.</P>

<P>    The concept of family isn't limited to humans. UGA  veterinarian Craig Greene is developing better diagnostic tests  for Lyme disease and other infectious diseases of pets and  people; Patty Gowaty's research on bluebird nesting pairs  redefines social relationships among the birds.</P>

<P>    Of course, there's much more in this issue, including  stories on the numbers that drive top-secret data encryption; a  new chemical process that deposits electronic-grade materials in  one-atom-thick layers; the soilless soil that has found its way  into almost every greenhouse; and interactive programs that  broaden the teaching repertoire of student music teachers.</P>

<P>    Our family of researchers covers virtually every facet of  life. But regardless of the subject matter, we believe, as Dean  Nickols writes, in the importance of "research to inform public  policies and educational programs" for the future.</P>

<P>    That's what Research Reporter is all about.</P>

SOAKING UP SOME HEAVY METAL

All the signs were there. Dead fish washed ashore. Shellfish disappeared. Seagull hatchlings bore deformities. 

<p>  But these warnings went unheeded, and by 1956, the people along the shores of Minamata Bay, Japan, began to suffer such symptoms as numbness, hearing loss and brain damage. What is now known as "Minamata Disease" finally was traced to mercury pollution from a nearby factory. 

<p>  Forty years later, mercury pollution is still a global problem. Because as anyone who has broken an old-fashioned thermometer knows, even in its most solid form, mercury is extremely difficult to clean up.

<p>  That's why the tiny plants growing in Richard Meagher's laboratory are receiving increasing attention. 

<p>  The University of Georgia genetics professor and his colleagues have altered a bacterial gene that, when inserted into the sprout-like arabidopsis plant, shows a significant ability to absorb toxic salts of mercury and convert the mercury to a comparatively harmless vapor.

<p>  "The results were just astounding -- far better than what we had expected," Meagher said.

<p>  Though it works in a petri dish, any real-world benefit depends on whether the gene, labeled merA, can be inserted successfully into larger, sturdier plants that live in mercury-polluted areas.

<p>  "Agricultural land in Florida, for example, is heavily contaminated with mercury from fungicides and bactericides used in citrus groves," Meagher said. 

<p>  A fringe of transgenic plants -- those that have the foreign gene inserted -- could be planted around polluted areas to stop contaminated runoff from reaching wetlands and the food chain, Meagher said. "This technology could have a huge environmental impact on any site contaminated with heavy metals."

<p>  But as excited as he is by its potential, Meagher said he believes several years lie between the lab and real-world applications because of the inherent difficulty of inserting genes into a foreign host.

<p>  The merA gene was first studied many years ago by UGA microbiologist Anne Summers. It is common in the abundant soil-borne bacteria that thrive only in areas polluted by mercury and other heavy metals. In their natural state, the merA-containing bacteria detoxify mercury to a degree, but they do not provide large-scale uptake of the metal.

<p>  The first challenge for the UGA team was to see if the gene could even survive in a plant. One of Meagher's graduate students first inserted the gene in a petunia in 1989, but the plant failed to grow on mercury.

<p>  Last year under Meagher's direction, undergraduate student Nicole Stack altered the genetic sequence of merA, which differed only 9 percent from its original state. Then post-doctoral associate Dayton Wilde helped insert the new gene into arabidopsis -- chosen because the small plant, a relative of cabbage and radish, grows fast, produces plenty of seeds and has a small gene pool. Finally, graduate student Clayton Rugh followed the genetically engineered plant's ability to grow in and reduce the amount of mercury in the petri dish.

<p>  The researchers were surprised how well it worked. Without the merA gene, arabidopsis died or, in some cases, never grew beyond a few feeble sprouts in the mercury-rich petri dishes. The plants with the foreign gene flourished, and, in fact, now require mercury to grow. In addition, the seeds of these lab plants have inherited the merA gene.

<p>  But their success is tempered by the unknown.

<p>  "Different soil varieties and growing conditions may necessitate further adjustments in the gene's design," Meagher said. "Will this process prove as effective in the real world as it does in a petri dish? We don't know."

<p>  Post-doctoral research associate Stan Dudka currently is putting the genetically modified arabidopsis to the soil test. His research should reveal whether the plant converts as much mercury to vapor in soil as it does in a petri dish. And Rugh, under the direction of forestry Professor Scott Merkle, is now working to successfully insert the gene into yellow poplar trees. 

<p>  But the project is not without criticism. Mercury vapor is not completely risk-free, and some environmentalists, Meagher said, have expressed concern about large fields of plants releasing mercury vapor.

<p>  "It's not a perfect solution," he said, "but releasing much less toxic forms of mercury into the air--where eventually it would deposit at naturally low concentrations -- makes more sense than leaving highly toxic mercury in areas that expose humans and wildlife to danger."

<p>  And it could prove to be a more viable, cost-effective alternative than current remedies like burying or incinerating contaminated soil, he said.

<p>  Meagher said he and his team are expanding their efforts to another gene, merB, which if combined with merA, should act on the most deadly form of mercury: methyl mercury, which is the form that entered the food chain through Minamata Bay.

<p>  Theoretically, the gene also could be altered to remove other heavy metals, such as copper and lead. And a recent experiment proved that the gene might have value beyond detoxifying pollutants. Arabidopsis plants with merA grew well in the lab on ionic gold.

<p>  "It's a fun prospect," Meagher said. "The plants could be burned off and the gold would remain." 

<p>  But a paucity of funding for such projects, even for the already successful merA research, continues to be a problem, he said. 

<p>  "In this area of research I have had 19 grants turned down in 14 years," Meagher said. In fact, he said, the merA research would have ended long ago if it were not for UGA biotechnology start-up funds and grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The success of the research finally has brought in the project's first National Science Foundation grant.

<p>  "It's 10 to 20 years off, but I believe this research will lead to real solutions for heavy metal pollution," Meagher said. "There are no guarantees, but it looks good so far."

<P> ATHENS, Ga. -- There's a new notion about old age: Advanced years don't have to be
empty years. Even the oldest old can lead productive, fulfilling and independent lives.</P>
<P> As more and more people pass the century mark without a second glance, they are setting
examples that are changing our ideas about aging.
</P>
<P>   At 104, Mary Sims Elliott was working on her autobiography, writing poetry and trying
to influence her church's position on social issues. Now she's 105 and her autobiography, titled
My First One Hundred Years, was just published.</P>
<P>   At 105, Geneva McDaniel taught aerobics daily at her senior citizens center. Now she's
107 and recruiting residents of her retirement community to exercise with her.</P>
<P>   At 106, former sharecropper Jessie Champion and his 86-year-old wife, Fronnie, were
weeding and harvesting their garden. Recently, Fronnie passed away and now Jessie, now 107,
lives and gardens with his daughter. 
</P>
<P> These vibrant centenarians are among more than 150 who have volunteered for the
Georgia Centenarian Study, a decade-long project that explores not just why some people live so
long, but how they do it so successfully.</P>
<P> "We want to see what influences longevity and adaptation in old age," said Leonard W.
Poon, who directs the UGA Gerontology Center and heads the study. "The primary focus is to
understand patterns specific to each age [group] and to individuals in their 60s, 80s and those
over 100 years of age who are community dwelling and cognitively intact."</P>
<P> Since 1988, Poon has directed the study that includes nearly a dozen faculty from the
University of Georgia, the Medical College of Georgia and Iowa State University, along with
dozens of graduate students. Representing many academic fields, the researchers study "expert
survivors" -- people who've passed their 100th birthday, live independently or semi-independently, are active in their communities and enjoy relatively good physical and mental
health -- and compare them with people in their 60s and 80s.</P>
<P> "We all have stereotypes of what a centenarian should be," Poon said. "But there's no
such thing as a typical centenarian."</P>
<P> Nonetheless, the researchers have drawn a composite picture of an expert survivor in the
Georgia study. She is a female with a grade school education who:</P>
<P>   lives by herself or with her children;</P>
<P>   has an income of $4,000 - $7,000;</P>
<P>   has vision and hearing problems;</P>
<P>   takes two medications a day;</P>
<P>   wants to avoid institutionalization;</P>
<P>   is feisty and wants to have her way; and</P>
<P>   is generally satisfied with life.
</P>
<P> By and large, expert survivors also are focused on the here-and-now and are just as active
in mind as in body. Just how these spry individuals got to be so old is a puzzle for centenarians
and researchers alike.</P>
<P> Some of the oldest old chalk it up to luck. And some, including Jennie V. Williams, 105,
say the "good Lord" isn't through with them yet. Others, like Mary Sims Elliott, say they're just
too busy to die. 

Clues to Longevity</P>
<P> After intensive analysis of biological, psychological and social factors that may
contribute to successful aging, the researchers haven't found any fountain of youth. While they
have charted some striking similarities among expert survivors, the researchers also have
observed many differences.</P>
<P> "You can't make generalizations about these very exceptional people because each one is
different," Poon said. "Centenarians continue to surprise us so that now surprises are the rule."</P>
<P> Among the surprises is that "some centenarians turn us down because they are too busy to
participate. They are on college boards or run their own businesses," said Martha Bramlett,  an
assistant professor of nursing at the Medical College of Georgia who manages data acquisition
for the study.</P>
<P> No two centenarians are the same. "For as many optimistic people, we find as many who
are grumpy," Poon said. "Successful aging has many, many components."</P>
<P> "Centenarians are far more different than they are alike," said Peter Martin, a former
UGA faculty member who co-directs the study and is now a professor of human development
and family studies at Iowa State. "There are many paths to longevity, and each situation is very
different." </P>
<P> Take a family history of longevity, for instance.</P>
<P> "People aren't likely to live long just because their parents did," Poon said. "It seems the
genetic contribution is important for some centenarians who come from a long line of long-lived
people. But we have as many people who do not come from long-lived families."</P>
<P> Funded by the National Institute for Mental Health, the study couldn't come at a better
time. Post-retirement citizens may be in the minority now, but that trend is changing fast. Senior
citizens are already the fastest growing segment of the American population, and the 85-plus
group may be the fastest growing among senior citizens, Poon said. </P>
<P> By the year 2025, the number of people under age 20 is expected to equal the number of
those 65 and older, according to reports published by the Joint Congressional Committee on
Aging.    </P>
<P> "People 65 and older are just now becoming a population for us to think about in terms of
health care, jobs and the economy," Poon said. "When that of proportion is the same as the
young people, this becomes very significant in terms of the work force, health care and
retirement."</P>
<P> The research team's findings will have effects that ripple far beyond the families of
silver-haired Americans. Their findings will help scientists, medical and social agency personnel,
and elected officials better understand the aging process and prepare for the centenarian
population explosion that demographers and census takers have predicted.</P>
<P> "The research will help our country provide the services needed as more people survive
to be 100," Poon said.</P>
<P> Like centenarians everywhere, those in Poon's study come from all walks of life. Some
have doctoral degrees; others never finished grade school. Some live alone in spacious homes;
others are so poor they lack even the basics such as a refrigerator. Several have a wealth of
family and friends they call on for aid; others rely on their wits to build a support network of
friends and neighbors.</P>
<P> Regardless of their lot in life, though, expert survivors face similar challenges unique to
their age group. With few road signs to guide them, they have adjusted to diminished physical
strength, faced the deaths of numerous -- often much younger -- loved ones and found answers to
life's meaning and purpose long after retiring from conventional roles as breadwinners and
parents.</P>
<P> The centenarian research project looks specifically at how physical and mental health,
intelligence, memory, coping skills, personality traits, attitudes, nutrition, spirituality, family
history, support systems and religious beliefs influence a long and independently lived life.</P>
<P> During phase one of the two-phase project, the researchers ask participants a battery of
questions and collect bundles of data on everything from what they ate for breakfast to what
makes them happy or sad. Then they compare the relative significance of each variable -- both
for individuals and for age groups -- to determine which ingredients are important in the recipe
for longevity.

Phase One: Many Roads to Longevity</P>
<P> So far, what the researchers have found in phase one is that no one variable stands out as
more important for longevity. Moderation, however, "seems to come up frequently and to be
practiced over one's lifetime," Poon said.</P>
<P> That may help explain why expert survivors are so hale and hearty.</P>
<P> "We were surprised to find very little depression among the centenarians," said Martin,
who directs the project's personality, life events and coping component. "These people have a
high degree of self sufficiency and are confident and resourceful in their ability to overcome
obstacles and problems.</P>
<P> "They describe themselves as I-can-do people. In fact, overall, their mental health and life
satisfaction are very high," he said.</P>
<P> But don't expect them to conform. </P>
<P> "Instead of growing more alike, people become more distinct, more differentiated, more
individualized and unique as they grow older," said Philip Holtsberg, one of Poon's doctoral
students. "And the longer they live, the more pronounced those differences become."</P>
<P> Even past the age of 100, though, centenarians still conform on some things, like good
health. About 50 percent of them try to avoid fats in their diets, said Mary Ann Johnson, who
heads the study's diet and nutrition component. They also eat more fruits and vegetables, get
slightly more vitamin A and carotene, and consume about the same amount of calories and fat as
their younger counterparts.</P>
<P> Among centenarians, age, however, is not the primary predictor of nutritional risk --
factors that may contribute to poor nutrition such as wearing dentures, taking medications that
upset the stomach or smoking. Emotions play a bigger role.</P>
<P> "How you feel -- happy or sad, understood or misunderstood --  is more important," said
Johnson, a UGA professor of foods and nutrition. "Aspects of mental health and the number of
illnesses, more than age, predicted nutritional risk among centenarians."</P>
<P> Expert survivors tend to be healthy and proud of it. Surprisingly, the researchers found no
significant differences among people in their seventh, ninth and 11th decades in the number of
medications taken, trips to the doctor or hospital, or recent illnesses.</P>
<P> More than 60 percent of the centenarians rated their health as good to excellent; an even
higher percentage said it was as good or better than five years ago, said Martha Bramlett of the
Medical College of Georgia.</P>
<P> "We know we get a skewed view of the health of centenarians in general because we only
look at those who are still community dwelling," Bramlett said. "But our check-ups confirm that
they are in remarkably good health. One gentleman, David, who is 105, still reads without
glasses and has 20-25 vision. Julia, a retired seamstress still threads her own needles at 100."</P>
<P> Successful agers also know the value of daily activity and mobility, and make an effort to
get exercise, Bramlett said.</P>
<P> Take Frank, 101, who drove to his job at the courthouse every day until his recent
cataract surgery. Now he often walks to work. Then there's Sara, 101, who works all week
keeping her own yard, flower beds and home tidy and neat. On weekends she travels to Atlanta
to clean house, do laundry and babysit with her great-grandchildren so her granddaughter, who
has health problems, can rest.</P>
<P> The research team also looked at the influence of religious beliefs on physical well-being
as well as on other factors. Although all three age groups scored high on the importance of
religion in their lives, the researchers found this had no strong correlation with physical or mental
health, personality or life satisfaction. This finding may be influenced, in part, by the uniform
level of high religious influence in all three age groups, said Bradley C. Courtenay, a UGA
professor of adult education who examined the relationship between religion and longevity.</P>
<P> Coping with hardship or loss, though, is another matter, Courtenay said. Expert survivors
rely more on spirituality and a deep trust in God and less on non-religious methods than the other
groups do.</P>
<P> "Centenarians tend to have a philosophy and keep with it, but they don't tell people about
their philosophy," Courtenay said. "They think everybody is supposed to have their own, so
they're not imposing."

The Second Time Around</P>
<P> Now that researchers have a "group snapshot" of people in their 60s, 80s and 100s, they
want a clearer picture of how each age group as well as each individual within the group changes
with the passing of time. </P>
<P> "Because people's life experiences influence the aging process, we don't know whether
it's age or peer-influenced differences we are observing," Poon said.      Phase two of the
study provides a sharper focus on which changes are related to aging and which are peer-influenced, such as having been the same age during the Great Depression or World War II.
Researchers re-test 60- and 80-year-olds after five years, 100-year-olds after 18 months.</P>
<P> "There are few longitudinal studies with centenarians because once they reach 100, we're
finding that life expectancy is only about 12 to 20 months, and if we wait too long, then we may
lose them," Poon said.</P>
<P> Sadly, that has already happened with some, including Elva "Speegie" Spangenberg, a
centenarian well-known to Atlantans, who died last December at age 107. At 98, she began a
new career as a tour guide at Rhodes Hall, an Atlanta historic site that was seven years her junior.
About a year before her death she resigned her post because of a fall.</P>
<P> "We've had counseling sessions for our testers to make sure they could deal with a
centenarian's death. They get very attached to the centenarians. It's like a family member dying,"
Poon said.</P>
<P> Phase-two testing of the centenarians, which is a repeat of the tests used in phase one is
often hard to conduct for other reasons, too -- mainly because of their physical and mental
decline. Poon predicts only about half of the original group will be able to participate.</P>
<P> "Those who are still around for the second round of tests are often too frail to be tested
for any length of time," he said. "We are finding that 18 months often is too long." </P>
<P> Poon illustrates the point by recalling "one lady who played ragtime piano for the testers
on their first visit. Her functional mental state was practically perfect," he said. "Eighteen months
later she could not answer many of the same questions. It was heartbreaking to see her go from
living an independent life in her own apartment to one in a nursing home."</P>
<P> Poon wants to expand the study to include institutionalized centenarians and compare
them to the community-dwelling individuals. He also wants to continue studies of dementia
among the oldest old, a project he began last summer with researchers at the University of
Lunde, Sweden. </P>
<P> For now, though, those plans are on hold; he and his team of researchers still have plenty
of phase-two data to collect, not to mention mountains of data from both phases to analyze. Then
there's the monograph on centenarian health issues that he and researchers from France,
Hungary, Japan and Sweden plan to publish next spring. </P>
<P> "I think longevity around the world is an important issue," he said. "Researchers from
different countries look at it somewhat differently, but we also have common hypotheses and
approaches."</P>
<P> In the meantime, Poon et al. have been adding more centenarians to their study. But
finding people who meet the study's criteria isn't easy.</P>
<P> "We go to a lot of chicken dinners, talk to a lot of people and pass the word along through
churches, senior centers and such," Poon said.</P>
<P> Potential participants must be screened to make sure they're cognitively intact. And that
brings up another problem for centenarian researchers: The questionnaires, surveys and other
tests they use were designed for and validated on much younger people. They may not hold true
for older populations.</P>
<P> "Any time you use a survey, it has to be validated for that particular population," Poon
said. "These people are outside of the range of an average life span. Since no one has tested 100-year-olds with these instruments before, we just don't know whether the tests work for the oldest
old," Poon said.</P>
<P> Despite the necessary ground-breaking efforts, Poon said he is optimistic that the research
will provide useful information. Although it's still too early to draw hard-and-fast conclusions
from the phase-two data, a preliminary glance shows "tremendous amounts of individual
differences," Poon said. "The changes in our centenarian group are very dramatic over the 18
months of study. </P>
<P> "As centenarians get closer and closer to death, I think a very different picture will
emerge in terms of their functioning, but I could be surprised again. Some centenarians may
maintain this profile of an independent, functioning person. After all, they've had this pattern for
100 years and 18 months may not change it," he said.</P>
<P> Even among the 80-something-year-olds, the researchers already have seen "a fantastic
amount of change," Poon said. "They have already lived beyond the average age, and then we
add five years to that."

Learning to Cope</P>
<P> While the researchers are interested in describing expert survivors' physical and mental
function, they are even more curious about how centenarians have compensated for their
diminished abilities.</P>
<P> Poon speculates that the "cohort effect" -- common experiences shared by people born at
the same time -- also will have a strong influence on how groups of people change over time.</P>
<P> "The influences of the environment, the context in which you grow up and the value
system that holds you up all of these years will be very important," Poon said. "And we know
your critical development stage in your 20s and 30s are important."</P>
<P> However, people in their 70s and older are in their last stages of development, which can
be the most trying -- and the most rewarding. The longer people live, the more difficulties and
losses they face. In addition to losing loved ones -- siblings, children and friends -- centenarians
face the loss of career, mobility, respect and attractiveness. They even lose the feeling that they
are making a contribution; often they're viewed as "has beens." </P>
<P> "The last stages of life may hold challenges to find ego integrity -- a wisdom or feeling
that your life has made sense -- and not to give into despair," Poon said, drawing on ideas
proposed by psychologist Erik H. Erikson who is noted for his work on ego integrity and ego
development.</P>
<P> Despite the fact people cannot change many traits -- like personality or cognitive ability --
even at 100, people are still able to change some things.</P>
<P> For example, researchers have learned the importance of studying compensatory
mechanisms like resourcefulness, which "may be a key ingredient to functioning independently
or semi-independently in the community," Poon said.</P>
<P> Although few of us may live long enough to blow out 100 candles, we can still learn
pointers from those who have, like the benefits of learning to cope with loss, adopting a positive
outlook or finding a central purpose in life. The most important lesson centenarians can teach us
may be that we're never too old to learn.</P>
<P> "No matter what your age, the memory is still trainable," Martin said. "You can teach an
old dog new tricks. Centenarians can still use their minds, reflections and personality skills to
compensate for or overcome problems."</P>
<P> And that's a good take-home message for us all. Especially since today's baby boomers
are tomorrow's centenarians.

<CENTER><H2>From the Editor</H2></CENTER>
<P>To the Reader:</P>
 
<P>As a reader of Research Reporter, you are among a diverse 
and erudite group. Almost all of you have a college degree; more 
than two-thirds have a master's degree; and half have a 
professional or doctoral degree.</P>
 
<P>Your education level was just one of many things that struck 
us as we tallied the results of the recent readership survey. We 
also learned you represent a broad range of academic disciplines: 
medicine, education, arts and humanities, agriculture, law and 
communications.</P>
 
<P>That's one reason we try to bring you a wide array of 
research stories conducted by UGA faculty and graduate students. 
This issue includes new findings about life and death in ancient 
Carthage pieced together from a 2,000-year-old cemetery by 
archaeologist Naomi Norman; a story about geneticist John Avise, 
who pioneered a new field that uses molecular tools to study 
evolution; and a report on the forces that fueled a very bleak 
time in American history: the lynching era.</P>
 
<P>You may not suffer from job burnout, but chances are friends 
and colleagues do. Robert Golembiewski's research shows that 
burnout has reached pandemic proportions and offers advice on how 
to avoid becoming a statistic.</P>
 
<P>The Briefs section includes reports on studies of bone 
density in women athletes, efforts to develop a vaccine for 
parrots and other feathered pets, research on how to get children 
more engaged in reading, the controversies brewing between 
international trade accords and environmental protection, and a 
system to preserve farming know-how gained through centuries of 
traditional cultivation methods.</P>
 
<P>Thank you for responding to the readership survey. Look for 
changes in future issues.</P>
 
<P>Happy reading,</P>

<CENTER><H2>The GIS Landscape</H2></CENTER>

<P> ATHENS, Ga. -- While road maps show the way from Point A to Point B, they're not
much help to researchers trying to re-create the past or plan the future of a geographic region.
Instead, today's researchers often turn to a geographic information system (GIS), which uses
computers to organize and analyze all sorts of data tied to geographic locations. </P>
<P> Plus, they don't have to be folded.</P>
<P> "A geographic information system is much more than a map," said Roy Welch,
founder and director of UGA's Center for Remote Sensing and Mapping Science. "A GIS
includes a layered  map' database in digital format and a set of computer tools that can
combine the layers into a variety of maps that show, for example, projected population
distributions, soil erosion patterns, changes in plant cover and optimum sites for business
locations."</P>
<P> The information stored in a GIS can range from dirt samples to remote sensing data. In
general, remote sensing uses high-tech eyeballs that record what they see from a distance.
While by this definition the human eye is also a remote sensor, satellite images and color
infrared aerial photos are more common forms of remote sensing data.</P>
<P> Over the past 10 years, the center has explored new ways to integrate GIS and remote
sensing techniques. The Everglades project is the largest region the center has tackled in such
detail, but by no means the only one. </P>
<P> "We've been quite successful in developing applications in disciplines such as
geography, ecology, forestry and so forth," Welch said. "The center has been a leader in the
development of geographic information system techniques for studying natural resource
management, soil erosion and global mapping."</P>
<P> For managing natural resources, the center has applied its tools to a number of areas
that are threatened by development. In a current project, Welch and geography graduate
student Jonathan Smith are working with The Nature Conservancy to create a GIS database of
the BOSAWAS Reserve in northern Nicaragua. Using this database, which combines satellite
images, Russian maps and fieldwork, The Nature Conservancy and Nicaraguan government
agencies will establish the boundaries of a protected reserve.</P>
<P> At the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve, the center's researchers
created a GIS to provide details on the topography, land use and vegetation on the island and
surrounding marshes. The GIS included aerial photographs dating to 1953, so the researchers
could see how the marshes changed over the years. The GIS helps researchers on Sapelo
preserve some of the last unaltered salt marshes on the Atlantic Coast.</P>
<P> For studying soil erosion, the center worked with the U.S. Department of Agriculture
to develop GIS methods for measuring soil erosion, which is closely linked to the flow of
fertilizers and pesticides into waterways. With the Georgia Department of Natural Resources,
the center developed a model of how sediment travels through the watershed, and is now
integrating GIS techniques and precision farming methods.</P>
<P> On a global scale, Welch and the center are working with CalTech's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory to create digital elevation models for the entire planet. This GIS database will help
set priorities for the Japanese-built Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
Radiometer (ASTER), which will begin a 5-year mission to record the planet's surface in
1998. The database will help pinpoint unmapped or poorly mapped areas of the Earth's surface
for which elevation models are needed. Accurate information on land elevation is vital for
research into such topics as global climate change.</P>
<P> In these and other areas, GIS databases are providing the road maps for researchers
asking how the Earth's future will unfold.</P>

<CENTER><H2>Southern History in Black and White</H2></CENTER>
<P>CONTACT: John Inscoe, (706) 542-6300</P>

<B><BLOCKQUOTE>    Because the history of racism in the South is very complex and because an individual view of racial matters depends on many factors, it is easy to oversimplify the problems and solutions.</BLOCKQUOTE></B>

<P>    Listen to the radio, pick up a newspaper or browse a list of  new book titles and you'll notice that matters of race are  garnering much attention from the national media these days. Not  since the troubled and turbulent '60s have racial issues so  pervaded our consciousness and conversations. Take, for example,  our interest in the vastly differing cases of Rodney King,  Clarence Thomas and O.J. Simpson or the publication of "The Bell  Curve," which has prompted an explosive debate over matters of IQ  and racial identity. Nor is this interest limited to a national  debate. Closer to home, controversies ranging from the flap over  the state flag to the composition of the UGA homecoming court  continue to prove divisive and newsworthy.</P>

<P>    As troubling as these incidents may be, they also serve as  both a catalyst and backdrop for a deeper understanding of past  and present race relations. In fact, at no time during the past  decade have issues of race been more palpable in history classes  than now. Students, faculty and history buffs intent on exploring  America's long and convoluted history of race relations have a  panoply of parallels between today's racial tensions and  controversies and those of earlier eras. </P>

<P>    Yet it's all too easy to oversimplify the historical roots  of national or regional racism. One of the most rewarding aspects  of teaching, doing research and writing about Southern race  relations lies in discovering and sharing with students just how  complex and varied the interactions among black and white  Southerners have always been. As a part of a generation born well  after the civil rights movement had run its course, today's  undergraduates react with genuine surprise, occasional shock and  some considerable confusion as they discover the extent and  intensity with which the "color line" long defined Southern and  American society.</P>

<P>    Among the courses I particularly relish teaching is  "Southern Autobiography as Southern History." Assigned readings  include widely ranging views by authors, black and white, and  their often disparate perspectives about race and racism bring  the complexities of this emotional subject into sharp relief. The  powerful, fugitive slave narratives by Frederick Douglass and  Harriet Jacobs and the searing accounts of coming of age in  Mississippi by Richard Wright and Anne Moody are juxtaposed with  nostalgic plantation memoirs by Joel Chandler Harris and William  Alexander Percy as well as the more enlightened treatises on  race, class and politics by Lillian Smith, Will D. Campbell,  Katherine Du Pre Lumpkin, Morris Dees, and Jimmy Carter.</P>

<P>    The richness of the autobiographical genre as historical  source lies in the extent to which such work humanizes and  particularizes issues that history classes often deal with in  more conventional, abstract terms. Although obviously subjective,  the intensely personal and often impressionistic accounts by  Southerners who have lived on both sides of the color line convey  a sense of the hard realities and numerous variables that shaped  the region's race relations. Even students who think they have a  good understanding of the South and its racial heritage often  express dismay and discomfort in reading these intimate accounts  of the cruelty -- both mental and physical -- inherent in  Southern racism. No two authors, black or white, experienced  slavery, Jim Crow or the civil rights movement in the same way;  the sheer variety of what each witnessed, felt, responded to and  was ultimately shaped by leaves history students with a far more  sophisticated sense of the diversity and complexity inherent in  the South's past as well as their own.</P>

<P>    At the same time, Southern autobiographies provide  considerable insight into several other factors inextricably  linked to both race and region: class, politics, religion, gender  and kinship, to name a few. Students are sometimes perplexed by  the collective contradictions and ambiguities represented by  these authors' vastly differing points of view. However, by  reading about such divergent reactions to life in the South,  students also come to appreciate the importance of context in  Southern race relations: They understand better how attitudes and  behaviors are shaped by locale, time period and human nature.  </P>

<P>    The complexities of race and racism were underscored this  past September when writers, journalists, folklorists, literary  critics and historians of both races assembled on campus for the  conference "Black and White Perspectives on the American South."  Their message was clear: There is not now, nor has there ever  been, a single black or a single white perspective about the  South or any aspect of Southern life. John Boles, editor of "The  Journal of Southern History," summed it up best when he said that  as slippery a concept as racism is, "it is often uncritically and  imprecisely used by itself to explain practically everything in  Southern history...It is commonly the interpretation of first  resort." In outlining the cyclical nature of Southern race  relations from the colonial era through the present, he stated  that while racism's existence is a constant, "its strength, its  influence, its causative agency, varies widely. It never acts  alone."  </P>

<P>    The sensitivity to the historical context of racism is  reflected in the work of recent graduate students in the UGA  history department. For example, the University of Georgia Press  has just published "Georgia in Black & White: Explorations in the  Race Relations of a Southern State, l865-l950," a volume of 11  essays, written by current and former UGA graduate students, that  reflect new questions and innovative approaches to the study of  racism. Included are essays on power struggles during  Reconstruction, when unprecedented change and opportunity  redefined the very essence of the South's political and economic  structures. They document the variety of venues through which  this struggle was played out: the unusual militancy and political  savvy of freed men in Greene County; a Republican governor  seeking to restore the seats of black representatives ousted from  the state legislature; and the concerted efforts and ultimate  failure of white and black Methodists to create a single biracial  denomination. </P>

<P>    Other essays explore the multi-generational legacy of  miscegenation in creating a black middle class in Hancock County  and the impact of Atlanta University's first female graduates on  black education and social service throughout the state. Still  others explore the contrasting attitudes of two accomplished  white women living in Athens during the early 20th century and  their diametrically opposed racial views; the struggles of two  Baptist ministers to create a biracial communal farm in Sumter  County in the l940s; and the carefully orchestrated cover-up by  Walton County residents in response to state and federal  investigations of the brutal lynching of two black couples in  l946.  </P>

<P>    As revealing as these essays are individually, together they  provide an even more dramatic testimony to the vast spectrum of  racial dynamics at play within the bounds of a single state. They  document the wide range of intricate and subtle interactions that  operated within, or in spite of, the color line. Despite the  perception of a Jim Crow regime of deeply entrenched and rigidly  enforced racial repression, we can still be struck not only by  the range of individuals and groups that defied that regime but  also by the diverse forms their challenges took.</P>

<P>    One historic event in Southern race relations is  particularly cogent to students in my American history survey  course. Among the readings I assign is "An Education in Georgia,"  journalist Calvin Trillin's riveting coverage of the  desegregation of the University of Georgia, which first appeared  as a series in The New Yorker in l961 and l962. When I ask  students what aspect of the book most surprised them, the range  of their responses often surprises me. Some express dismay at the  hostility and fear that the presence of Hamilton Holmes and  Charlayne Hunter-Gault -- the university's first two black  students -- generated among students at other universities and  among white citizens throughout the state; others find it odd  that there wasn't more resistance from university and state  officials or that desegregation on our campus never met with the  virulent and violent opposition exhibited at state universities  in Alabama and Mississippi. More perceptive students often are  struck by differences between the way Holmes and Hunter-Gault  faced this challenge. The personalities, temperaments and goals  of the two black students were significant factors both in how  they acted and were acted upon. The varying degrees of contact  each had with different elements of the university and the Athens  communities also tinted their experiences.</P>

<P>    Such reactions reflect the extent to which racial attitudes  and assumptions are still shaped by both individual and communal  experiences. UGA students, black and white, continue to exhibit  subtle and not so subtle variations in the geographical,  cultural, social and educational baggage they carry to Athens.  The complexities of race relations so evident in the story of the  first two black students ever to set foot on the University of  Georgia campus more than 30 years ago are equally apparent today  in current students' responses to that story. That in itself  demonstrates why the racial history of the South remains so  complex, emotional and deeply personal and why its study remains  an invigorating, rewarding and interactive learning experience  for all of us. </P>

<P>    There is a tendency to discard the ugly events of the past  and shove them onto the scrap heap of history. But some of the  most unsettling memories in America demand to be acknowledged --  both for what they reveal about the past and what they portend  for the future.</P>

<P>    "The era of lynchings in the South is something that's  hidden. It's basically ignored," said UGA sociologist E.M.  "Woody" Beck. "It's not a part of Southern history which most  people are proud of. It brings back too many negative images of  the South's past."</P>

<P>    Even now, generations later, scars remain. It still hurts to  talk about historic lynchings, and yet they continue to color  perspectives, spark controversy and touch off heated debates. </P>

<P>    "When you dig into American history, you find some very ugly  episodes," concedes Beck's colleague, Stewart Tolnay, a former  UGA associate professor of sociology.</P>

<P>    To get a clearer picture, Beck and Tolnay studied individual  lynchings that occurred in the South during the "lynching era,"  about a 50-year period that followed Reconstruction after the  Civil War. In "A Festival of Violence: An Analysis of Southern  Lynchings, 1882-1930," their research reveals the sinister side  of human nature and the power of an idea: two insights they say  they hope will help us understand such atrocities.</P>

<P>    In the minds of some, "the power of racist ideology can  justify torture and brutal treatment of other human beings," Beck  said. He argues that it was that power that triggered the South's  lynching era.</P>

<P>    According to Tolnay, who now is a professor of sociology and  the director of the Center for Social and Demographic Analysis at  the State University of New York at Albany, some of those  insights might shed light on current situations in other  countries.</P>

<P>    "One lesson we learned from the work we did was that when  groups are distinguished from others, whether it's because of  their race, religion or whatever, and there is economic stress,  there is the potential for violence," Tolnay said. "You will  probably find that in Bosnia and Rwanda there is underlying  economic competition or stress and that it occurs on an ethnic  dimension."</P>

<P>    Beck described some of the lynchings they studied as "simple  executions"; others, he said, "seemed to be like parties," from  which the authors drew the ironic title of their book.</P>

<P>    "The thing that surprised me the most when we were doing our  research was learning just how vicious these mobs could be to  other human beings," Tolnay said.</P>

<P>    When Beck, Tolnay and former UGA assistant professor of  sociology James Massey began researching the lynching era in  1986, they quickly discovered that their six-month project  actually was going to take several years. </P>

<P>    "The quality of the source of information was the biggest  problem," Beck said. The data contained so many errors that the  research team spent three years just verifying individual  lynching incidents using newspaper articles of the times. Beck  and Tolnay spent another three years analyzing the data and  writing "Festival of Violence" based on their findings. In 1992,  they were awarded the Social Science History Association  President's Book Award for Unpublished Manuscripts.</P>

<P>    The book, published earlier this year by the University of  Illinois Press, is not meant to be a history but an analysis of  American lynchings. </P>

<P>    "Our book is very analytical as opposed to being a  historical narrative," Beck said. "There has been study of  lynching done by traditional historians in a narrative framework,  which is fine, except that they didn't answer some of the  questions we wanted to ask."</P>

<P>    They focused their research on the Southeast, where the  majority of lynchings occurred: Alabama, Arkansas, the Carolinas,  Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.</P>

<P>    Based on their findings, Mississippi and Georgia had the  largest overall number of lynchings, but Florida ranked highest  in number of lynchings relative to the size of the state's black  population. The sociologists also verified that between the end  of Reconstruction and the beginning of the Great Depression, on  average one black person per week was lynched in the South.  Ninety-four percent of those victims died at the hands of white  mobs.</P>

<P> Deadly Forces Underlie Lynching Era</P>

<P></P>

<P>    In "Festival of Violence," Beck and Tolnay argue that  several forces fueled the already heated relations between  Southern blacks and whites. It was those forces, they say, that  triggered the lynching era and kept the fire burning for almost  five decades.</P>

<P>    "You've got to have a racist ideology that says that another  group deserves this kind of treatment," Beck said. "You have to  have competition that is a threat in some form. You've got to  have a situation where the government is very permissive, and you  also have to have triggering events" or specific incidents in  which mobs lash out at their victims.</P>

<P>    All of these forces were at work in the South during the  lynching era, he said. The racist ideology that supported slavery  in the South didn't end with the demise of slavery. Readjusting  their opinions of the black population was easier said than done  for many white Southerners.</P>

<P>    The mindset of white Southerners was a very important  contributing factor during the lynching era, Beck said. Racist  ideology "justified white mob action against blacks," he said. "I  see that as the power of an idea, just like the idea of anti- Semitism gave the justification for the Holocaust.</P>

<P>    "The late 1800s was a period when racist ideas were very,  very common," he said. "Many whites sought a means of social  control to ensure that the black population didn't carry the idea  of freedom too far. It was a very strange form of freedom, a sort  of quasi freedom in some ways."</P>

<P>    Resentment and racism were represented at every level of  white Southern society -- from poor tenant farmers to wealthy  plantation owners and influential leaders, Beck said.</P>

<P>     "Poor white hoodlums" most often were blamed for the  lynchings. Beck said he believes, however, that "for the system  to operate the way it did, it required both people in the mob and  people who weren't in the direct mob but who sanctioned the  killings."</P>

<P>    "The politicians who gave those glorious racist speeches  didn't have to be in the mob to set the environment for  violence," he said. "The editorialists and the number of  preachers who never said a word against lynching and all those  people who shaped public opinion have a share of the  responsibility." </P>

<P>    Tolnay said he was shocked at "the extent to which the  dominant society overlooked the behavior of the mob." The  researchers place the bulk of the responsibility for creating the  racist environment on the shoulders of Southern politicians. </P>

<P>    "If I had to allocate responsibility for the overall trend,  it would be to the local politicians of the period because so  many of them used racism as their political tool," he said. "They  may have said something like: 'Well sure, lynchings aren't nice,  but you know we have to control these people.' What that does is  send a message that says racist ideas and the inferior position  of blacks are acceptable and moral, and then it becomes an  accepted part of the culture."</P>

<P>    For white tenant farmers, who frequently shared the same  standard of living as blacks, violence was used as a means to  allow poor whites to continue to feel superior, Beck said.</P>

<P>    "The white farmer had been told all along that blacks are  inferior," Beck said. "How can you demonstrate that status  difference?" Mob violence was used to fashion such a difference,  he said.</P>

<P>    Violence also was supported by a profit motive. The  ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment was the final nail in  the coffin of the South's slave-based economy. The white elite --  mainly plantation owners -- still "needed to control a large  black population which they had used to generate wealth," Beck  said.</P>

<P>    Racist views towards blacks may have been the cornerstone of  the lynching era, but Beck doesn't subscribe to the theory that  mob participants were "sociopaths or evil individuals." Rather,  he thinks of them as basically average people whose racist views  gave them "permission" to do horrible things.  </P>

<P>    "It comes back to the power of an idea," he said. "Most of  these people went back home after a lynching. They petted their  puppies and loved their children. There was this idea that  lynching was permissible because blacks were subhuman."</P>

<P>    "What kept impressing me was the power of racist ideology to  motivate people to do things that we would consider today to be  totally unacceptable," Tolnay said.</P>

<P>    The researchers argue that whites lynched when they felt  threatened in some way by blacks. "Competition sets a climate  that is very conducive to violence," Beck said. Lynching was used  as a way of suppressing black competitors.</P>

<P>    When blacks received the right to vote, white politicians  from counties with black majorities faced black challengers for  their jobs. Blacks were threatened, beaten and sometimes killed  when they tried to vote for black politicians, Beck said.    </P>

<P>    Economic competition also prompted violence by some white  Southerners. "When whites felt threatened, especially  economically, they were more likely to act out violently," Tolnay  said.</P>

<P>    Beck and Tolnay also found that traditional cotton-growing  areas hit by hard economic times were especially susceptible to  mob violence. In areas where cotton dominated the local economy,  they found there was an especially high number of lynchings.  </P>

<P>    "When cotton prices would fall and inflation was bad, so  that you were getting a greater economic squeeze, the lynchings  went up," Beck said. The number of lynchings peaked when cotton  prices plummeted in the 1890s.</P>

<P>    Lynching was designed to send a message from the white  community to the newly freed black population, Beck said. </P>

<P>    "We're talking about huge numbers of lynchings which were in  the newspaper on a weekly basis and sometimes on a daily basis,"  he said. "It was widespread and the message was 'See how  vulnerable your community is to this informal means of social  control? So don't get out of line.'"</P>

<P>    According to Beck, two types of justice systems were at work  in the South then: the formal court system and the informal  lynching mobs. </P>

<P>    "You might think that when lynch mob activity was high it  would be following low periods of legal executions," he said.  "We didn't find that to be true at all. In fact, our conclusion  is that both justice systems were operating."</P>

<P>    The researchers dispel the belief that "popular justice" was  necessary to control the black community. </P>

<P>    "The idea of popular justice stems from imagery dealing with  the frontier mentality, where you didn't have established court  systems, so people had the right to establish their own informal  system of social control," Beck said. </P>

<P>    "The thing we were struck by was that this wasn't  necessarily because of the absence of a legal system. The legal  system in the South was well-established. There was this idea  that the mob had the right to lynch and that it was acceptable to  go outside the bounds of a legal statute," he said. "There were  people who were lynched after being found innocent by courts.  Some were even prevented from coming to trial. They would be  arrested, then taken from the jail and executed. There was a  sense in these racial incidents that justice was being served by  the mob."</P>

<P>    The reason this informal justice system was allowed to  operate, Beck said, was because of the South's "permissive  government," which he cited as another force behind the lynching  era. "Racist ideas extended far beyond the borders of the South,"  he said. "It's only in the South where the lynch mob took a more  activist role. I think that's because Southern states were much  more permissive of lynch mob behavior."</P>

<P> The Demise Of The Lynching Era</P>

<P></P>

<P>    The number of lynchings dropped dramatically after the mid- 1920s, and by the '30s five bloody decades of lynching finally  began to taper off. According to Beck, two important factors led  to the demise of lynching: states' action against mob violence  and the migration of thousands of blacks from the South. </P>

<P>     "Lynching became increasingly bad PR for state  governments," he said. "The lawlessness of lynchings wasn't  compatible with the imagery of the New South and so states turned  from a permissive stance toward mob violence to one of non- permissiveness. They wanted to show that the New South was not  the old cotton plantation. The New South was industrial. The New  South had different race relations."</P>

<P>    Gradually more and more people began to speak out against  mob violence.</P>

<P>    "I'm not saying these were racial liberals saying 'We ought  to love our fellow man,' but some were saying that that  particular manifestation mob violence was inappropriate. We  start seeing states intervening and preventing it."</P>

<P>    The migration of blacks from the South also played a part in  the decline of mob violence. This migration, which began during  World War I, peaked between 1920 and 1930. According to Beck and  Tolnay's research, Southern states lost almost 700,000 blacks  during that time. The percentage of blacks who lived in urban  areas also leaped from 17 percent in 1900 to 33 percent by 1930. </P>

<P>    "Those areas where there were high numbers of lynchings tend  to be in the areas where most blacks left," he said. Georgia, for  example, lost 22 percent of its black population.</P>

<P>    Violence, of course, was not the only reason blacks fled the  South. "In terms of the overall migration period, the lynchings  were only one part of a much larger picture of the declining  agricultural economics of the South and the increasing lure of  Northern jobs," Beck said. </P>

<P>    During the period of black migration, the white Southern  elite began to feel the effects of the loss of the black labor  force.</P>

<P>    "In those areas where they began to realize that the black  labor force was leaving and there was still a need for them, you  begin to see some editorials condemning lynchings and saying to  mob participants, 'Look, you're driving our people away,' Beck  said. "The need for social control of blacks was not as great  anymore."</P>

<P>    The combination of these factors caused the number of  lynchings in the South to drop dramatically. Beck and Tolnay  discovered that in the 1890s, 799 blacks lost their lives because  of mob violence, while during the 1930s, 88 blacks were lynched. </P>

<P> Lessons For Today</P>

<P></P>

<P>    Their research does more than answer questions about the  causes of the lynching era; it also provides insights for today's  ethnic, racial and religious intolerance, Beck said.</P>

<P>    "I see two big lessons from this whole study: One is about  the state taking a permissive role and how that influences </P>

<P>violence and second, how important ideology is when it starts  to dehumanize and what it gives us license to do," he said.</P>

<P>    Even though lynchings are rare in the United States today,  the "underlying processes" that helped to create the lynching era  are still at work; racial violence has just taken on "different  manifestations," said Tolnay, who points out that different races  all over the world still are inflicting pain on other races.</P>

<P>    "There is nothing about human nature that prevents this kind  of violence. That's what is going on in Bosnia and Rwanda. It  takes a special effort from individuals to prevent us from doing  these kinds of horrendous things to each other," Tolnay said.</P>

<P>    Even in America today the potential for mob violence still  exists, Beck said. </P>

<P>    "People ask me if we could have mob violence again. I say,  'Sure, of course we could.' But it's not acceptable," he said.  "You don't see politicians advocating or justifying mob violence.  State governments have taken typically a very hard line against  mob violence and if people are involved, they will be prosecuted  today."</P>

<P>    Another reason mob violence is not as prevalent today, he  said, is because now people view mob violence very differently.</P>

<P>    "The mindset is very, very different. The overt racism that  was perfectly acceptable up until the mid 1960s is now less  publicly acceptable," Beck said. "There is always the potential  for mob violence, whether it's at a football game or soccer match  or anyplace; it's just a question of how the government  responds to the violence."</P>

<P>    While much has changed since the lynching era in the South,  vigilance for racist ideology is still important, the researchers  say -- and not only on a regional basis.</P>

<P>    "I don't think racism is any stronger here than it is any  place outside this region," he said. "The historical legacy is  very different, but I don't see the South as unique in its racist  ideas by any stretch of the imagination. It's a national  problem."</P>

<CENTER><H2>Untangling the Genetic Code</H2></CENTER>

<P>ATHENS, Ga. -- Will Taylor hadn't planned on a gene hunt.</P>
<P> As part of his research into drugs that block the enzymes that control HIV replication, he
ran across a handful of signs that put him on the trail of a different quarry.</P>
<P> First, there were the pseudoknots. These twisting structures in RNA -- the genetic
material of HIV and other retroviruses -- can cause hiccups in the process of translating the RNA
code. These hiccups, called frameshifts, can even shift translation of the genetic code into an
entirely different gene, which means a different protein will be constructed.</P>
<P> The challenge of finding potential pseudoknots and frameshift sites hidden in long
stretches of genetic code led Taylor, a UGA associate professor of medicinal chemistry, to
develop some innovative methods.</P>
<P> "My most useful tool in some cases is just colored pens," Taylor said. "Some of the early
work was done at a pretty primitive level -- folding RNA in my head, looking for possible
frameshifts or pseudoknots. It gets pretty complicated, and having different colored pens has
been useful."</P>
<P> In the HIV code Taylor was examining, these pseudoknots cause shifts into RNA regions
that, at first glance, look like genetic "junk," regions which don't contain instructions for
building proteins. Scattered throughout these regions are numerous signs that normally halt the
translation of RNA into proteins and tell geneticists to stop looking for genes. One particular stop
sign, called a codon, reads "UGA" -- genetic shorthand for the three-nucleotide sequence of
uracil, guanine and adenine.</P>
<P> "I guess it was my own naivete, or maybe just being kind of boneheaded or persevering,"
Taylor said. "Even though the stop codons were there, I took some fragments, translated them
and looked at what the amino acids would be. I started hitting protein databases with those
fragments, and they came back with some tantalizing things."</P>
<P> In the process, he came upon the final clue: Rarely, and under specific conditions, the
"UGA" codon is not a stop sign at all; instead, it tells the RNA to insert selenocysteine (SeC), a
selenium-containing amino acid.</P>
<P> "As soon as I latched onto that idea, everything fell into place," Taylor said. By following
the "UGA" signs like an alumnus to a home football game, he eventually located six genes or
gene variants in HIV that potentially could construct selenoproteins.</P>
<P> He chased "UGA" down a trail that led to the genetic code for human T cells. There,
Taylor saw familiar signs for inserting SeC into proteins.</P>
<P> In RNA, there are three possible stop codons, and each should appear randomly
throughout true junk RNA -- an emphatic "No, really, this is junk." However, instead of a
random mix of the three different stop codons, Taylor noticed that parts of these supposed junk
regions contained significant clusters of "UGA" codons. Mathematically, the probability that a
cluster of 10 "UGA" codons would overlap the CD4 gene by chance alone is one in 59,000.</P>
<P> In more recent work, Taylor has computerized the process of hunting for "UGA"-rich
genes. His "gene viewer" program, developed with Dan Everett, a UGA assistant professor of
computer science, has helped locate what may be selenium-encoding genes in the dreaded Ebola
virus, as well as in several types of herpesvirus and a strain of coxsackievirus. The Ebola virus,
for example, has a gene with 16 occurrences of the "UGA" codon, which has a chance
probability of one in 43 million.</P>
<P> In the human genetic code, Taylor has found other "selenium genes," including several
more in T cells. His research team also has identified a huge selenium gene containing 22
"UGA" codons that overlaps a human "proto-oncogene," which, when mutated, can cause
cancer. "Needless to say, this has pretty radical implications related to the possible roles of
selenium nutritional status in cancer," Taylor said.</P>
<P> He may not have intended a gene hunt, but Taylor has bagged some interesting trophies
along an intriguing new trail.

<P>    Financial satisfaction depends more on your state of mind  than on the size of your bank account. That's one conclusion  family economist Deborah Godwin draws from her recent  comprehensive studies of families and their budgets.</P>

<P>    The fact is, net worth has relatively little to do with  whether families are satisfied with their lot in life -- or  whether they will exercise good budgeting and goal-setting  skills.</P>

<P>    "Couples must control their attitudes in order to control  their financial well-being," said Godwin, an associate professor  in the UGA department of housing and consumer economics. "A  positive attitude toward cash flow management yields positive  results."</P>

<P>    Godwin's research, which aims at the heart of family  financial behavior, sheds light on how different management  practices affect families' financial outcomes and may help shape  policies and programs aimed at helping families avoid financial  problems.</P>

<P>    "As family economists, we want to identify which couples  will get into financial trouble and educate them against it,"  Godwin said.</P>

<P>    Behavioral change is important, experts agree, because many  families are having increasing difficulty managing their  finances. According to the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of  Atlanta, more than 40,000 Georgians filed for personal bankruptcy  in 1990, an increase of 71 percent in just three years.</P>

<P>    "This trend should decline only because of the lower  interest rates and improved economy," said Jeff Humphreys, an  economist with the UGA Terry College of Business. "Still, if  family behavior does not improve, the bankruptcy trend will rise  when interest rates rise."</P>

<P>    Godwin found that a couple's willingness to manage finances  is the most consistent predictor of their financial behavior. In  a random sample of more than 250 newlywed couples throughout  Georgia, she examined three common aspects of cash flow  management techniques: budgeting, financial record keeping and  goal setting/analysis.</P>

<P>    She discovered that, rich or poor, the same rules apply:  Those who think financial management is important, practice it;  those who don't, don't -- and are more likely to end up  dissatisfied with their finances.</P>

<P>    Roughly half the newlyweds in her study practiced budgeting  activities such as estimating income and expenses. One-third  engaged in record-keeping, which she said is especially important  "because it makes them feel confident. Records give us an  immediate measure of how we are doing."</P>

<P>    Fewer than one-third set goals and analyzed their balance  sheets frequently. "But goal-setting is not as easy to measure,  so immediate benefits are probably not as easy to see, either,"  Godwin said.</P>

<P>    Families often gauge their financial satisfaction on more  than their bank account balance, she said. They may compare their  assets to their peers or to their parents at the same age. And  though her findings indicate that spending more time on financial  management doesn't guarantee a healthier bottom line, it confirms  that those who are future-oriented practice cash flow management  more than those who concentrate on the present.</P>

<P>    Her research also may give scholars good reason to change  the advice they offer in books and counseling. Although it is too  soon to tell whether her findings can be used to predict  financial trouble, it "leads us toward a new perspective in  financial education," she said.</P>

<P>    "Financial educators need not worry only that families lack  financial resources or ability to perform cash management," she  said. "We should focus on attitude change as the first step in  behavioral change."</P>

SOURCE: Patty Gowaty (706) 542-3365</P>

<P>    The birds and bees are getting easier to explain all the  time. In fact, avian ecologists like Patty Gowaty are finding  that Eastern bluebirds have some rather surprising mating habits.  And those may shed light on how social behavior evolves among  songbirds.</P>

<P>    With the help of some new techniques and even newer  questions, Gowaty is among the scientists who now have  discovered, for example, that female bluebirds are not  necessarily the monogamous mates they were once thought to be.</P>

<P>    "Although females are socially monogamous, it turns out they  are genetically polyandrous -- they mate with more than one  male," said Gowaty, a UGA associate professor of ecology.  "Sometimes they also have multiply sired broods."</P>

<P>    Broods that are multiply sired result in healthier, more  diverse offspring that could have increased chances of surviving.  But it's another aspect of their social behavior that fascinates  Gowaty and guides her research.</P>

<P>    "I am interested in the evolution of social behavior, and  this is an opportunity to test hypotheses about natural  selection," she said. </P>

<P>    Specifically, Gowaty is looking at how natural selection --  the principle that the proportion of individuals possessing  characteristics advantageous to survival will increase in  succeeding generations -- affects variation in social processes  in bluebirds.</P>

<P>    "I study bluebirds because they interest me," she said. "But  if somebody wants to know whether there's any direct utility for  understanding, say, human behavior from bluebird behavior, the  answer is, 'No.' However, studies of bluebird behavior can  suggest hypotheses about human behavior."</P>

<P>    Aggression, for example. Gowaty speculates that social  monogamy in bluebirds may, in part, be explained by the fact that  females fight among themselves.</P>

<P>    "While aggression is fairly common between two females, it's  almost nonexistent between the females and males," she said. "So  why are female bluebirds immune to something human females are so  vulnerable to?"</P>

<P>    Although scientists don't have hard and fast answers on  that, they know that male bluebirds may have more than one mate  and one nest. And until recently scientists thought all bluebird  eggs laid in the same nest at least had the same father.</P>

<P>    But DNA testing confirms that female bluebirds multiply  mate. In fact, one study revealed that 19 percent of bluebird  chicks were not genetically related to their "fathers" (the male  socially paired with their mothers), and 30 to 60 percent of  individual nests contained babies from more than one father.</P>

<P>    "The DNA studies allow us to infer the genetic parentage of  the chicks in each nest," Gowaty said. "The Eastern bluebird,  Sialia sialis, is one of several North American bird species now  known to be socially monogamous yet genetically polyandrous AND  polygynous."</P>

<P>    Many other species form lifelong pairs -- a male and a  female who stay together through many mating seasons -- but the  vast majority of social monogamy research in birds has been done  on European songbirds. Based on a literature survey, Gowaty found  that only about 20 percent of bird species studied so far  actually are genetically monogamous for both sexes.</P>

<P>    These and other recent findings, coupled with a subtle  change in the way some scientists approach their research, have  Gowaty and others pondering new possibilities.</P>

<P>    There's been a shift in perspective, said Gowaty, who is  also on the faculty of the UGA Women's Studies Program.</P>

<P>    "Many new theories about avian behavior are distinguished by  really incorporating the female perspective," she said. "Looking  at social behavior from a female perspective -- either human or  bluebird -- gives rise to new questions. Questions like: What  motivates female behavior from the female bluebird's perspective?  What are the constraints on female bluebird behavior? Why would  she be constrained to mate with one male when another might be a  better mate?"</P>

<P>    Such questions are shaping up into what Gowaty calls a  "paradigm riffle."</P>

<P>    "It's not that the whole theoretical orientation of the  world is changing, but there definitely are differences in the  way newer theories are conceptualizing problems," she said. "We  are basing questions on females' perspective."</P>

<P>    For example, based on evidence that female bluebirds  multiply mate, Gowaty is investigating the advantages of genetic  polyandry.</P>

<P>    "If we assume that there will be advantages for females that  mate with males with good genes, then multiply mating is just a  by-product," she said. "The question changes from, 'Why do  females multiply mate?' to 'When should a female be genetically  monogamous?'"</P>

<P>    The answer to the latter seems to be "Almost never," since  multiply mating is advantageous in many situations. After all,  female bluebirds often can't see all available mates before  pairing off. If a lady bird chooses a mate from a limited pool, a  "better" one might fly in the next day.</P>

<P>    Or perhaps her original choice was a result of what Gowaty  calls coercion: The most "genetically attractive" male may not  have the best territory or the best nest site. "And the male that  displays the most helpful behavior may not have the best genes  for, say, resisting parasites and pathogens," she said. "By  expanding her mating horizons, the female may provide her  offspring with better genes and a better environment."</P>

<P>    In the bluebird world, much of this recent riffle was  launched by the finding that female Sialia sialis multiply mate,  and Gowaty is among those who have expanded its application. The  unexplained findings from her previous field studies are a case  in point. She found that bluebird males "guard" their mates,  following the females around when the latter are fertile. Under  the unriffled paradigm, it was believed that guarding males were  simply keeping other males away. Logically, this means  closely-guarded females should have fewer matings with males  other than with their social mates. Closely guarding males,  therefore, should be less likely to end up caring for other  males' babies.</P>

<P>    But several years ago Gowaty found just the opposite: Males  who follow their mates most have MORE non-kin babies in their  nests. In light of this surprising result, Gowaty re-evaluated  the theory using the new perspective.</P>

<P>    "What we're thinking now is that the males are trying to  keep the females at home," she said. "They don't start guarding  until they realize their females might be copulating with other  males. The tip-off for males might be how frequently females stay  on home territory or stay away from home territory."</P>

<P>    Although the overall view is the same -- birds don't want to  waste resources caring for someone else's babies -- the slight  shift in viewpoint led to a new interpretation.</P>

<P>    Gowaty also established that the male of the pair reacts  differently to mixed broods. The male and female share feeding  duties roughly equally when the nestlings are young. As the  chicks grow, the female feeds all the chicks about the same, but  the male brings less food to the nest if some of the babies  aren't his.</P>

<P>    "The big question for us is how does he know. We know he  does not tell by looking at them," Gowaty said, "because  experiments with nests that contain only the father's chicks have  shown that when chicks are switched, he can't tell the  difference; the male continues to feed with the same frequency as  before.</P>

<P>    "I think the male may adjust his behavior based on the  behavior of his mate," she said.</P>

<P>     In upcoming work, Gowaty will investigate a possible link  between female reproductive behavior and male caretaking behavior  by attempting to correlate stay-away behavior in females with  reduced feeding activity by males.</P>

<P>    Other upcoming work also will shed light on guarding  behavior by tracking how much the males follow different types of  females. Gowaty said she thinks the research team can predict how  a male, once he observes that "his" female frequently strays from  the territory, will react.</P>

<P>    "What we expect," she said, "is that those stay-away  females, once they get back into their territories, are going to  be guarded like glue." </P>

BEHIND THE SCENES

<p>
Fungi hold a special place in our history, if not in our hearts -- as epicurean delights, the foundation for wonder drugs or the cause of the early 19th century potato famine.

<p> But whether they appear as truffles, ringworm or penicillin, they share one thing in common: They are ubiquitous, and identifying them from more than 100,000 species requires a vast collection.

<p> "Our herbarium is like a library, a reference resource, but instead of books, we have a collection of fungi," said Richard Hanlin (right), curator of the University of Georgia's Julian H. Miller Mycology Herbarium, which holds 25,000 specimens.

<p> The collection is used as a teaching and research tool, as well as a resource for fungi-related problems, such as helping doctors identify the kind of mushroom eaten by a child. Even though it focuses on the identification of organisms from the Southeastern United States, the collection regularly receives requests from as far away as Europe and South America.

<CENTER><H2>The Politics of Opinion</H2></CENTER>

<P> ATHENS, Ga. -- In his History of the Peloponnesian War, the historian Thucydides
described what drove Athens to conquer much of the Greek world. He boiled down the
city-state's motivations to fear, honor and profit.</P>
<P> A couple of millenia later, most political scientists ascribe foreign policy opinions to two
motivating factors very similar to those of Thucydides: security and prosperity.</P>
<P> To those, Bill Chittick would add a third dimension.</P>
<P> "I have spent 10 years trying to get the literature to accept a third dimension: identity,"
said Chittick, a UGA associate professor of political science. The new dimension asks to what
degree people identify with the wider global community or more narrowly with their country.
"You have to be able to answer this identity question before it's possible to determine whose
security or prosperity is at stake."</P>
<P> Chittick has reanalyzed past surveys of foreign policy opinions from both the public and
the foreign policy elite. The responses were best explained by three motivations, each of which
describes a spectrum of opinions about how foreign policy decisions should be handled:</P>
<P> * "Security," ranging from militarism to nonmilitarism, describes how readily a country
should use military force to solve problems;</P>
<P> * "Prosperity," ranging from isolationism to internationalism, relates to how strongly
decisions ought to emphasize either domestic opportunities, such as jobs, or foreign interests; and</P>
<P> * "Identity," ranging from unilateralism to multilateralism, measures the degree to which
the country should solve its problems alone or as part of the global community.</P>
<P> Chittick's dimension of identity expands a model of foreign policy, based on the security
and prosperity dimensions, that has stood since the Vietnam War. In fact, after World War II, a
one-dimensional model of foreign policy was the norm; under that model, everything could be
explained by the dimension of prosperity alone.</P>
<P> "I think the dimensions have always been there," Chittick said. "It's a matter of their
being perceived clearly."</P>
<P> The new model proposed by Chittick, along with colleagues Keith Billingsley, a UGA
associate professor of political science, and Rick Travis of Mississippi State University, will be
published in the Fall 1995 issue of International Studies Quarterly.</P>
<P> The model helps explain a number of stubborn questions about public opinion and
foreign policy, in addition to suggesting changes in the way public opinion polls are conducted.
For example, the new dimension best defines the foreign policy differences between the
Republican and Democratic parties. </P>
<P> "Across the board, most Republican leaders are unilateralists, and most Democrats are
multilateralists. That's a key difference," Chittick said.</P>
<P> The new model also has two major implications for research into the attitudes that
underlie foreign policy. For one, this model, unlike models without the identity dimension, holds
up statistically in surveys of university classes, so academic researchers initially can conduct
more frequent surveys at lower costs.</P>
<P>  Chittick's model also has major implications for research into the attitudes that underlie
foreign policy.  For example, it may help government, political and media pollsters, who conduct
frequent attitudinal surveys during major events like the Gulf War, provide more accurate and
meaningful results. Generally, these polls ask only a few key questions, tracking how the
numbers go up and down over time, and account for differences based on demographics such as
age, sex or region of the country. They usually don't dig deeply into how feelings about identity,
security and prosperity affect those numbers.</P>
<P> "They're not asking enough basic foreign policy questions to really give us any feel for
why these changes are occurring," Chittick said.  Individual questions don't reveal, for example,
whether public opinion has shifted along one or several dimensions -- whether basic beliefs are
changing.  </P>
<P> Such explanations matter, since evidence now suggests that "if more than 60 percent of
the public favors an action, it's almost mandatory," Chittick said. Knowing the underlying
reasons for changes would help foreign policy decision-makers not only predict how the public
would respond to various actions, but also make better decisions.</P>
<P> "We have a lot of trouble trying to measure this change," he said. "People are still trying
to use the same old yardstick."</P>
<P> Maybe Thucydides would say the yardstick just isn't old enough.
</P>

KING OF THE ROAD

It's no small problem for a big industry: The drop-out rate among long-haul truck drivers is a whopping 60 percent a year.  

<p> And new drivers don't come cheap; it costs $3,000 to $5,000 every time a driver leaves.

<p> Concerned about this alarming situation, Fred Stephenson conducted a nationwide survey in 1995 to find out why truck drivers are so dissatisfied.

<p> "We don't focus enough on the people who do a good job and on keeping them happy," said the University of Georgia marketing and distribution professor. "So we conducted a survey of the ones who are still there to see what it's going to take to keep them employed."

<p> The survey targeted the long-haul business because "that's where the turnover problem is most acute," he said.

<p> Stephenson surveyed for-hire truckers who typically drive cross-country carrying loads from one shipping dock to another. Of the 2,256 surveys distributed, nearly 1,800 drivers responded, making it the second largest driver study ever undertaken with the highest company participation. In all, 57 trucking companies in 26 states were represented.

<p> According to his survey the typical driver is a 35- to 44-year-old male who works between 60 and 70 hours per week and is home about once every two weeks. But he's only making $30,000 to $40,000 per year.

<p> And there's the rub: Compensation was the drivers' overriding concern. Although it is a demanding, blue-collar profession, truck driving carries neither the sentimental appeal of the American farmer nor the typical salary of an electrician, plumber or railroad engineer. 

<p> "Pay and benefits were almost universally given the highest scores in importance, even by the tank truck drivers who earn the most right now," Stephenson said. "Most of these drivers are in the prime of their earning years and are facing high family costs like college tuition. They're worried about making ends meet and improving their lives."

<p> Deregulation in the early 1980s created wide-open competition and truck carriers felt pressure to hold the line on costs.

<p> And a salary solution may not be forthcoming anytime soon. "Trucking companies can't raise pay unless shippers are willing to accept that there's a problem and rates may go up a little bit," he said.

<p> But there are other avenues of relief for the truck-driver blues. "When we looked at the top 10 driver needs, more than half were concerns like trust, respect, appreciation and pride   issues that are so much cheaper to solve than wage problems," he said.

<p> At the University of Georgia's annual trucking profitability conference, Stephenson offered some solutions to the retention problem:
<ul>
<li>  Value driver opinions and ideas.
<li>  Give drivers as much status as possible; make them feel like partners in the business.
<li>  Reward and recognize high performers and get rid of  bad apples because drivers want the truck driver image to improve.
<li>  Stand up for drivers when customers treat them improperly. Win or lose, the support will improve drivers' respect for management.
<li>  Create more options and flexible benefits.
</ul>

<p> "We take this $340 billion industry for granted. I'm trying to help people understand that it's very important that trucking is a crucial industry in this country," Stephenson said. "Practically everything you have in your home, everything you eat, all the clothes you wear and cars you buy were brought to you by trucks."

SECRETS OF STORK SURVIVAL
<br>
</font>
<font size=2>

To wood stork chicks at Birdsville in Middle Georgia, Larry Bryan looks more like a villain than a hero.

<p> The ecologist invades their treetop nests, snaps identification bands around their legs and collects blood samples before retreating. Bryan is among the researchers at the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (SREL) in Aiken, S.C., who are on a mission to save the endangered wood stork.

<p> "Ultimately, we want to aid in the recovery of this species," Bryan said. "Banding birds, taking blood samples and learning about wood storks' basic biology will help us do that." 

<p> For nearly 14 years, UGA ecologists like Bryan have scaled towering cypress trees -- from an inland swamp in Birdsville to coastal barrier islands -- to study wood storks where they roost and nest.

<p> "It is labor-intensive, but we place leg bands on chicks because it is the best way of documenting wood stork survival and movement," he said. "Wood storks move about in a large geographic area, and following them for observation and study is a difficult task."

<p> Information gathered from these studies may be critical to the survival of wood storks, whose numbers have dwindled from more than 18,000 nesting pairs 60 years ago to approximately 7,000 pairs today. The wood stork is a highly specialized feeder with a big appetite found in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, and depends on shallow wetlands with high densities of fish.

<p> SREL research also will aid efforts to restore natural wetlands and create artificial ones, such as the Department of Energy's Kathwood ponds in South Carolina. Among SREL's findings are:

<p>    Wood storks fly as many as 50 miles to forage.

<p>    Chicks often return to their natal colony from one breeding season to the next.

<p>    In some settings, wood storks feed as often at night as during the day.

<p> Although banding storks enables Bryan and other scientists to track individual birds from season to season and year to year, it also has its drawbacks. For one, it requires visual identification of each banded bird.

<p> "For all the work we did to band 65 birds in Georgia in the summer of 1995, we only saw one banded bird at Kathwood -- a stork from the Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge on the coast of Georgia," Bryan said.

<p> Nor can banding data alone account for why populations of these large wading birds are on the rise in Georgia and South Carolina but are declining in Florida. Are the recent population shifts fueled by a northward migration of birds from Florida, where wetland habitats are in short supply because of urbanization and agricultural development? Or could it be that storks are adapting to the inland and coastal wetlands of Georgia and South Carolina?   

<p> "If Georgia and South Carolina are such great areas for storks, why haven't many of them been here for the past 100 years? We hope to find out," Bryan said.

<p> Blood samples -- both those he collected and those donated by the Florida Freshwater Fish and Game Department -- may help provide the answer. Bryan is working with scientists at Texas Tech to analyze samples from wood storks in both states in search of a genetic marker. Such a marker would enable scientists to track individual birds by their shed feathers.

<p> "If we can determine genetic markers for Georgia and Florida storks, we could just analyze genetic materials in shed feathers to determine where the birds came from rather than taking days at a time and climbing trees to band birds and draw blood samples," Bryan said. "Determining whether the Georgia colonies represent one population or several different ones will tell us how to better manage wetlands for the wood stork."

<p> In the process, Bryan might show if these birds of a feather really do flock together.

<CENTER><H2>The Family -- Society's Smallest Democracy</H2></CENTER>
<P>CONTACT: Judy Purdy (706) 542-5932<BR>
SOURCE: Sharon Nickols (706) 542-4879</P>

<P>    Families are universal. The warp and weft of a society's  fabric, they are valued by virtually every culture as the  preferred environment in which to conceive and raise children.</P>

<P>    At their best, families provide us with all our basic  physical and developmental needs: food, shelter, clothing,  safety, love, nurturance and acceptance. When families are unable  to meet these societal expectations or when society does not  provide adequate support for families, the social fabric frays  and weakens.</P>

<P>    Lately, the bonds of families in every nation have been  tugged and stretched by tremendous social, political and economic  pressures. More and more families are having difficulty providing  adequately for the needs of their members, especially their  children.</P>

<P>    Some observers of families contend that the family is  becoming an endangered species; others say they are in crisis or  at-risk; still others explain that families change as they adapt  to the major changes of the 20th century.</P>

<P>    In declaring 1994 the International Year of the Family  (IYF), the United Nations stated:</P>

<P>    "When a society is cohesive, law-abiding and productive, the  source of its strength can invariably be traced to the strength  of its families. Today, families face many crises -- famine,  poverty, unemployment, drugs and AIDS -- as well as changing  economic, wage-earning and lifestyle structures. Nevertheless,  the family remains a vital means of preserving and transmitting  cultural values; it is the child's paradigm for the world  outside."</P>

<P>    Democracy, a cherished value among many U.N. member nations,  is the basis of the International Year of the Family motto --  "building the smallest democracy at the heart of society." The  IYF logo is a roof that shelters two hearts, one large and one  small, illustrating the vital connections between society and the  family.</P>

<P>    IYF highlights the need for leaders at all levels of  government, from local to international, to:</P>

<P>    * Increase awareness of family issues among governments and  the private sector;</P>

<P>    * Strengthen national institutions in their efforts to  develop, carry out and monitor family policies;</P>

<P>    * Stimulate efforts to address family-related problems;</P>

<P>    * Enhance the effectiveness of local, regional and national  family programs;</P>

<P>    * Improve cooperation among national and international non- governmental organizations; and </P>

<P>    * Build upon ongoing activities benefiting women, children,  youth, and aging and disabled persons.</P>

<P>    Numerous reports on the status of families document the  growing diversity of family experience. All of them reinforce one  fact: Families cannot be considered simplistically and certainly  not from the idiosyncratic perspective of one's own experience.</P>

<P>    A widely held view, even among many policy makers, is that  by virtue of having lived in a family, each of us is a family  "expert" -- that is, we each know what a family "is" or "ought to  be."  A related attitude is the nostalgic view that families were  "better" in the "good old days."</P>

<P>    Unfortunately, these false beliefs influence and encourage  policy development that is uninformed by current family research.  They also show we know remarkably little about family processes  or exactly how intrafamily interactions affect individuals. It is  research, not personal experience nor historical myths, that  should guide the development of policies and programs for  families.</P>

<P>    An example of the failure to use available studies is  federal support for child care in the United States. Despite  dramatic increases in the numbers of working mothers in the  1960s, President Nixon vetoed child care legislation in the early  1970s on the grounds it would "destroy the American family."   More than 20 years later, similar legislation to improve the  quality and availability of child care was finally signed into  law by President Bush. </P>

<P>    One could argue it took more than two decades for policy  makers and society at large to overcome a nostalgic image and to  accept the fact of employed mothers in need of child care  services -- a fact that had been documented by family researchers  30 years ago.</P>

<P>    Scholars face many challenges when it comes to studying  families:</P>

<P>    * Families are sometimes reluctant to participate in  research because of the shroud of privacy about family life. </P>

<P>    * Policy makers may attempt to thwart legitimate studies of  family processes because of their belief that family matters  should be off limits to researchers.</P>

<P>    * Models to match the enormous complexity of families are  difficult to construct. Families are increasingly diverse and  increasingly changing.</P>

<P>    * Funding for family-related research is grossly inadequate. </P>

<P>    We still have much to learn. Overt violence against family  members is the most obvious example of how far the world has to  go in implementing democratic principles within the family.  Violence, including physical abuse, sexual assault and female  infanticide, is still more likely to occur in the home than  anywhere else, and the perpetrators are still most likely to be  other family members. </P>

<P>    Some individuals are at-risk in their own families because  of persistent attitudes that support the power of patriarchy.  Cultural values that view women and children as property, customs  that require wives to bring lucrative dowries into marriage, and  social and economic systems that place greater value on sons than  daughters obviate against "building the smallest democracy at the  heart of society."</P>

<P>    Families have the responsibility of caring for dependent  members at both ends of the life cycle. In this century, each  generation in Westernized countries has borne fewer children than  the previous one. Similar trends exist in some developing  countries as a result of legislation, such as The Peoples'  Republic of China's stringent one-child policy.</P>

<P>    At the other end of the life cycle, improved health services  are helping more people live longer. The result? Some adults will  spend more years providing care for elderly relatives than  rearing children. And as the proportion of prime wage earners  shrinks, less public and private economic support will be  available for the younger and older generations. In Japan, which  has the highest life expectancy in the world, the proportion of  older people is expected to double from 8 percent in 1975 to 17  percent by the end of the century.</P>

<P>    Both economic growth and its opposite, stagnation, also  have enormous effects on the family and the "bread-winner" role  among men and women. Women now make up 45 percent of the U.S.  work force; families are increasingly dependent on those incomes.  In many Asian and Middle Eastern countries, values that once kept  women at home are being challenged by more job opportunities for  women and changing attitudes about women's roles.</P>

<P>    One of every three households in the world today relies  solely on the woman as the income-earner, a result of divorce and  the increasing proportion of children born to unmarried women --  nearly one in four births in the United States alone. Based on  the experience of the 1980s, family scholars predict that 60  percent of U.S. children will spend some part of childhood in  one-parent homes -- and 90 percent of these will be headed by the  mother.</P>

<P>    A variety of economic and social circumstances keep female- headed households disproportionately poor. In African countries,  almost a third of the households in many rural areas are headed  by women, often a result of their husbands' migration to urban  areas in search of jobs. When entire rural families migrate to  cities in search of a better life, they too often find unsanitary  slums and diminished well-being or worse. U.N. data indicate the  number of refugees -- 80 percent of whom are women and children - - more than doubled in a decade, to 18 million in 1992.</P>

<P>    The family -- as an individual unit and as a social  institution -- is the stage where tradition and modernity play a  continuous tug of war. Some scholars have observed that family  values have not changed, but that norms -- expectations about  behavior -- have undergone dramatic transformations in many  countries. For example, divorce, almost taboo in the United  States just three decades ago, is now widely accepted.</P>

<P>    Extended families, customary in rural areas of Asia and  Eastern Europe where jointly owned land enhances families'  economic possibilities, are becoming more the norm once again in  urban areas. Housing shortages and deteriorating economies are  forcing related families to live together just to survive.</P>

<P>    As family patterns transform, research will help governments  and families respond and adjust more effectively to shifting  political, demographic, economic and social forces.</P>

<P>    In Georgia, the governor and General Assembly have endorsed  the International Year of the Family. At the university, faculty  and staff in the College of Family and Consumer Sciences and the  Cooperative Extension Service, along with the Coalition of Family  and Consumer Sciences Professionals, are hosting forums to affirm  the centrality of families and to review trends and current  situations.</P>

<P>    Regardless of how families change, cultural beliefs in the  importance of families will likely persist. This affirmation  should be linked with respect for and use of research to inform  public policies and educational programs so that families  continue their essential place in the social fabric.</P>

<CENTER><H2>Memory, Medication and Mistakes</H2></CENTER>
<P>WRITER: Judy Purdy (706) 542-5932<BR>
SOURCE: Denise Park (706) 5422-4211</P>

<P>    Taking the right pill at the right time -- every time -- is  tough enough at any age.</P>

<P>    That's why for nearly a decade UGA psychology professor  Denise Park has studied how memory, especially among the elderly,  affects how well patients adhere to doctor-prescribed regimes.</P>

<P>    "Whether you take medications as prescribed is a complex  behavior with lots of factors," said Park, who directs the  Southeastern Center for Applied Cognitive Aging. "I look at very  basic processes such as what normal memory function is and how  much decline is normal with age."</P>

<P>    The consequences of not following doctor's orders can be  dire. "Medication adherence is a very serious issue," Park said.  "Obviously, misuse of medication can be life threatening."</P>

<P>    Park's research on medication adherence confirms that old- old adults -- people 75 and older -- make more medicine-related  mistakes and are considerably less adherent over time than  others.</P>

<P>    "Old-old adults have poorer comprehension and more  difficulties organizing and integrating unfamiliar medication  information," Park said. "Their mistakes are primarily omission  mistakes."</P>

<P>    But make no mistake about this: The old old aren't the only  ones who forget to take medicine. With funding from the National  Institute on Aging and the AARP Andrus Foundation, Park studied  medication patterns among adults ages 35-65, 65-75 and 75 and  older who have hypertension. She found that while young-old  adults performed well, middle-aged folks needed to improve their  memory for pill popping.</P>

<P>    Nonadherence among middle-aged patients may be a result of  "busyness and beliefs," Park said. "They are very obligated and  they're on cognitive overload all the time, whereas people in  their 60s, typically 60 to 75, have the cognitive skill to be  adherent, and they feel very vulnerable. Thus they have a belief  system about illness consistent with a desire to adhere."</P>

<P>    Park now speculates that beliefs play a large role in  medication adherence, and she has initiated several new studies  to test this idea.</P>

<P>    "For the very old, cognition becomes more important;  whereas, for younger adults beliefs are more important," she  said. "If the doctor tells you that you have illness X and you  don't believe it, maybe you'll be polite and take the  prescription, then deep six it as soon as you get out the door.  Obviously, you're not going to adhere to that medication because  your cognitions about your illness are not compatible with what  you're being told to do."</P>

<P>    In a new study, Park will measure beliefs and knowledge  among hypertensive elderly African Americans and then relate  these to medication adherence to determine what predicts  nonadherence.</P>

<P>    "It is believed that nonadherence in this group is very  high, but nobody really knows," she said. "African Americans are  much more susceptible to hypertension, which is a silent illness.  You can't tell when your blood pressure is up -- you don't feel  sick -- so you don't take your meds. We want to find out if this  is an at-risk population for nonadherence, and if so, why."</P>

<P>    Park plans to use her data to develop a profile of people  most likely to skip their medications, as well as to design  effective intervention techniques involving memory aids that  improve medication adherence.</P>

<P>    In another medication adherence study she first compared  beliefs and behaviors among elderly people who have two very  different diseases that share similar symptoms: rheumatoid  arthritis and osteoarthritis.</P>

<P>     "The meaning of adherence in these two illnesses is very  different although some of the symptoms are the same," she said.  "Rheumatoid arthritis is quite serious and it is critical that  patients take their medications to slow the course of the  disease. If they don't, they'll get worse. On the other hand,  there are no meds to slow the progression of osteoarthritis so  the only reason to take the meds is to alleviate pain."</P>

<P>    Park also wants to learn whether a high level of medication  adherence improves quality of life -- mobility, depression and  social engagement, for instance -- as well as knowledge of and  beliefs about these two diseases.</P>

<P>    "The belief is that people with rheumatoid arthritis who  adhere are functionally better. Are they? Do they get out more?  Do they do more? We are hoping to compare what variables predict  adherence and also look at the quality of life for people who do  versus don't adhere," Park said. "If, for instance, people with  osteoarthritis who don't adhere have a better quality of life  than people who do, that tells us something about the value of  these painkillers."</P>

<P>    A spoonful of sugar may help some medicine go down, but Park  wants to help people, especially the elderly, remember to take it  in the first place. She has already shown that the elderly adhere  better when using over-the-counter pill containers combined with  individualized medication charts. Now she is exploring even more  effective memory cues such as bottle caps that beep when it's  time to take a pill.</P>

<P>    And her research may help patients get better -- in more  ways than one.</P>

VIEWPOINT
</font>
<br>
<font size=3>
Positioning University Research
</font>
<font size=2>
by Joe L. Key
</font>
</center>
</font>

<p>
<img src="./rrkey.gif" align=right>
The buzzword on Wall Street in the  90s -- "downsizing" -- has made its way to Capitol Hill. From there, it will quickly spread to the laboratories and libraries that form the foundation of university research.

<p> Since last summer, Congress has been sifting through suggestions and proposals in an effort to balance the federal budget by the year 2002. 

<p> One belt-tightening strategy Congress has considered is the elimination or consolidation of some cabinet-level departments. Energy, Education and Labor are all under review, as are the Commerce Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. Congress also is investigating budget cuts for several federal agencies, including the national endowments for the Arts and the Humanities.

<p> Two prominent organizations that promote research face uncertain futures. For the time being, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) -- the largest nondefense federal sponsor of university research -- has emerged fairly intact. Congress granted a 5.7 percent increase for 1996, but the buck may stop there. Under the House Budget Committee plan, NIH would experience a budget freeze through 2002.

<p> The National Science Foundation (NSF), which supports the very best of science, math and engineering research, has not fared as well. Congress has passed numerous continuing resolutions that have enabled NSF to operate slightly below its fiscal year 1995 $3.23 billion budget. But Congress has been contemplating much larger cuts -- up to $200 million in NSF research spending.

<p> Compounding the proposed financial constraints is the public's perception of scientists and scientists' perception of public support. In a Science & Government Report article, Rep. George E. Brown Jr., D-Calif., the ranking democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, is quoted as saying, "Scientists do not have a large and/or deep support network throughout society. They're esteemed. But support for science, as the saying goes, is a mile wide and an inch deep. In times where there's a conflict about resource allocations, science is suffering from the inch-deep problem."

<p> Such realizations have many faculty and administrators at research universities feeling more than a little uneasy despite President Clinton's proposed FY97 budget that increases funding for basic research by 2 percent and applied research by 4 percent. To be successful contenders for federal funds, public and private universities must realign their research activities to mesh with national priorities. And as federal coffers shrink -- and competition increases -- the successful institutions will be the ones that find ways to do more with less.

<p> At the University of Georgia, administrators are moving to strengthen research programs by improving our competitive edge. As we evaluate existing programs and implement new ones, we seek to:

<ul>
<li>Find more effective ways to administer, fund and reward research;
<li>Encourage interdisciplinary, team approaches to research programs through seed grants;
<li>Make the university a regional and national center for fine arts and humanistic studies;
<li>Foster research that involves faculty, staff and students in addressing social problems, community and state needs, and economic development in Georgia;
<li>Encourage seasoned members of the faculty to mentor less experienced ones in writing research proposals;
<li>Encourage more collaboration with other universities and institutions, both domestic and foreign;
<li>Increase efforts to secure research funding from corporations and industry; and
<li>Develop a technological infrastructure to improve electronic sharing of information, technologies, ideas and solutions.
</ul>

<p> With these proposals implemented, the University of Georgia will help secure a bright future for its research programs, just as our changes in the past have helped create our current success. 

<p> It's been only three decades since UGA administrators, with backing from state government, decided to become a major player in the research arena. Since that time, the role of the scientific community has changed. During the Cold War, the marriage of science and the military secured American independence. But national priorities today require new directions in research toward more studies that will produce socially viable solutions rather than programs that lean too heavily on theory.

<p> The research orientation at the University of Georgia has shifted as well. From its established base in the biological sciences, especially in ecology, to its more recent biotechnological emphasis, UGA research has adapted to society's needs. The trend has continued through the past decade as the university began to build partnerships with business and industry to develop applied research. The 3,000 percent growth in government and private research funding -- from $3 million in 1964 to more than $90 million in 1995 -- attests to the success of UGA's adaptations. 

<p> It's tough to say what the next three decades will bring, but it's a safe bet the near future won't see any dramatic increases in government research funding. Successful university-based research programs will be the ones that take their cues from the federal government: They will be able to adapt to a changing national agenda, shift their focus to reflect federal research priorities and find ways to become more efficient. We've already begun that process at the University of Georgia by eliminating duplication, stream-lining administration, sharing facilities and trimming or completely abolishing low-priority services and projects.

<p> The national research agenda must remain flexible if it is to continue to address the nation's social, economic, humanitarian and scientific needs efficiently and effectively. We, as researchers, must remain flexible as well.

<p> It is imperative that we find the time and mechanisms to persuade society in general, and decision-makers in particular, on the importance of research to our personal and national health and well-being.

<p><i>Joe L. Key, vice president for research at the university since 1986, also maintains an active research program in the botany department, where he holds a research professorship. His research interests include understanding the molecular mechanisms that influence high-temperature stress and other environmental stress agents on gene expression as well as hormonal control of growth and development through the regulation of gene expression in soybean and Arabidopsis thaliana -- the new model system for gene manipulation studies in plants.</i>

Fundamentals of Fat
</font>
<br>
<font size=2>
by Judy Bolyard Purdy
</font>
</center>
</font>

<p>
<img src="./rrfat.gif" align=right>
<b>When</b> you lose weight, fat cells don't disappear. They just get skinnier. 

<p> That's bad news for obese people, who already have made a lot more  and often bigger
 fat cells. To stay trim, their fat cells have to be even leaner than other people's. 

<p> And if you gain weight, your body may create more fat cells to store the additional
calories. 

<p> "We're trying to find out what turns on fat-cell growth," said Roy Martin, head of UGA's
foods and nutrition department. "We think maxxed-out fat cells send a signal to convert
[undifferentiated] cells into fat cells. "

<p> "The more we understand about how fat cells are recruited, the more we'll be able to learn
how to control them or prevent their development," said Dorothy Hausman, a research associate
in Martin's lab.

<p> Martin, Hausman and her husband, Gary Hausman, a researcher at the USDA Richard B.
Russell Laboratory, study 
the factors that influence fat-cell development both in early life and in adulthood.

<p> Dorothy Hausman studies fat at the cellular level. She examines what triggers
undifferentiated cells, which are not yet developed, to become fat cells and which ones are
destined to store fat. Starting with a growth medium that supplies all the required nutrients, she
adds a variety of other ingredients  such as hormones  to see which ones stimulate or inhibit
fat-cell growth. For example, she and her graduate students have shown that fat-cell extracts 
either from genetically obese rats or from overfed rats  caused prolific growth of the cultured fat
cells. "We think when fat cells get to a point where they can't hold any more lipid, they secrete
something to trigger more fat-cell development," she said.

<p> While Dorothy Hausman studies fat at the cellular level, Gary Hausman investigates what
influences fat development in prenatal pigs. That's because most fat cells are formed early in life. 

<p>  "Most fat cells are formed in fetal stages of development, and pigs and humans are more
alike than they are different in their fat-cell biology," Martin said.

<p> Their research, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, may lead not only to leaner
pork in the grocery store, but also to a better understanding of hormones that control the
development of fat cells early in life.

<p> Gary Hausman was the first to show that the pituitary gland, which regulates overall
growth, development and metabolism, also secretes several hormones that stimulate fat-cell
growth and development. He also showed that obesity may be associated with higher-than-normal
levels of thyroid hormone combined with suppressed   levels of growth hormone. 

<p> In other experiments he and Martin showed that glucose metabolism also may play a role
in early fat-cell formation. Fetal pigs that later grew obese had a higher level of glucose
metabolism than those that developed normal fat percentages. 

<p> The pair also observed differences between piglets born to obese sows and those that had
lean mothers. Piglets whose mothers were fat had larger fat cells and absorbed more lipids from
the blood stream.

<p> "It's difficult to treat obesity," Dorothy Hausman said. "And it's not going to be a simple
answer to the question of how to control fat-cell development."

<P> ATHENS, Ga. -- It's been 400 years since Amerigo Vespucci drew his first maps of
the New World, so you'd expect that every square inch of the United States has been mapped
nine ways to Sunday by now.</P>
<P> And you'd be right, give or take four or five million acres in Florida.</P>
<P> "The first explorers landed at the tip of Florida -- De Soto was there, Ponce de Leon --
and went around the Everglades and on up. [Eventually] the whole United States was all
mapped, except this blank area of the Everglades," said Marguerite Remillard, an associate
research scientist with the UGA Center for Remote Sensing and Mapping Science.</P>
<P> The Everglades remained a blank spot because ground-based surveying methods
weren't well-suited for the wet terrain, and the demand for economic development wasn't
sufficient to overcome the geographic obstacles, said Roy Welch, UGA research professor of
geography and the center's director. Until now, photomaps from the 1960s and hand-drawn
vegetation maps remained the most detailed pictures of the region.</P>
<P> "The Everglades has a fantastic history with pirates hiding out there, a lot of drug
dealing -- even today, planes will go down and be left there. We flew over and we'd see these
remnants of a fuselage just lying out there," Remillard said. "It's amazing that it's 1995 and
[the area] hasn't been mapped yet in any great detail."</P>
<P> That's been a problem for the National Park Service as they work to protect three
neighboring areas in south Florida -- Everglades National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve
and Biscayne National Park -- in the face of invasions by humans, exotic plants and
hurricanes.</P>
<P> "We're making major changes to the park by doing prescribed burning, nature's
making changes like Hurricane Andrew, we're making large water modification changes to the
park, and we don't know what's happening to our vegetation resources," said Bob Doren, the
assistant research director at Everglades National Park. "A map can be used for us to set some
long-term goals about how we look at these things and how we monitor them for change.
That's really the point."</P>
<P> For all this, they need more than a map; they need a brand new way to create one.</P>
<P> Keeping tabs on the vegetation, including the cypress, mangrove and melaleuca trees,
on such a large scale has as much to do with computers and satellites as it does with plant
ecology. By bringing together the technologies of a geographic information system (GIS) and
remote sensing, the center is piecing together not just a map, but a digital database of some of
the last unspoiled wetlands in the United States, a stone's throw from the Miami suburbs.</P>
<P> "We believe that the data we can provide is fundamental to understanding the dynamics
of what is taking place and also to establishing policies that will benefit the natural
environment well into the 21st century," said Welch, who leads the project.

Mapping a Route to Preservation</P>
<P> Although the Everglades has been under constant pressure from external disturbances
for many years, the major impetus for getting this project rolling can be pinpointed to a
particular day: Aug. 24, 1992. The impetus had a name -- Hurricane Andrew -- and wind
speeds of more than 140 miles per hour.</P>
<P> Andrew ripped across the southern tip of Florida, razing towns and cutting wide swaths
through the pine forests, mangrove thickets and cypress swamps of the three parks in what
ecologists euphemistically call a "broad-scale disturbance." Andrew disturbed the living
daylights out of the Everglades. But in Florida, hurricanes happen.</P>
<P> "This area is hit by hurricanes and has been for eons, so these plants are adapted to
them," Remillard said. "They're very intense disturbances, but they're natural disturbances
and they do reoccur over time."</P>
<P> Under normal conditions, then, the plants have evolved to recover from the worst
nature can dish out. However, with all the changes humans have made over the years, no one
is sure just what the normal conditions are any more. For example, in the mangrove area
where the hurricane did a lot of damage, the mangroves normally would grow back, given
enough time. However, an imported species, the Brazilian pepper, puts a wrinkle in this
scenario. This South American shrub tends to invade disturbed areas, choking off all other
plants and evicting the wildlife that live there. The park service is worried that, if left
unchecked, the Brazilian pepper will take over the mangrove communities.</P>
<P> The park service also is at war with melaleuca, an Australian tree introduced in the
1930s to dry up the Everglades, before people understood the importance of wetlands. It
worked, but now the melaleuca are spreading out of control. As it turns out, the worst way to
manage a stand of melaleuca is to cut it or burn it down, because the species immediately
"drops its seeds and reproduces like crazy," Remillard said.</P>
<P> Similar management problems occur with human disturbances, such as water-flow
changes as the coastal cities siphon off water and the rising nutrient levels as agricultural
runoff flows into the watershed. The map might reveal that one area is beyond help and that
the park service would make better use of its limited resources on another.</P>
<P> "All of a sudden there's a lot of concern over the environment and what's taking place
there -- what the expansion of Miami and the agricultural areas is causing as they butt up
against the Everglades," Welch said. "We're developing maps and a geographic information
system database oriented toward modeling the vegetation and the environment, both for now
and into the future."

Putting the Pieces Together</P>
<P> What they need is a multilayer jigsaw puzzle that covers more than 6,600 square miles
in and around the three parks. This huge task, more simply known as the Everglades project,
uses GIS methods to organize and analyze plant community details and remote sensing data. </P>
<P> Welch founded the Center for Remote Mapping and Sensing Science in 1984 to
investigate just this sort of application of remote sensing and GIS methods. Remote sensing
describes any data recorded from a distance -- by satellites, planes or even hand-held cameras.
Geographic information systems use computers to manage and analyze all sorts of data tied to
geographic locations -- from dirt samples to satellite images.</P>
<P> The bottom layer of the Everglades puzzle is a mosaic of eight French satellite images,
anchored to control points from a global positioning survey. This "digital image mosaic"
underpins the entire project. </P>
<P> "Any time we point to a pixel -- or picture element -- in that digital mosaic, we can
also recover the ground coordinates of that point," Welch said. "That will give us the control
that we need to fit the aerial photographs to that digital image mosaic." Now that the digital
image mosaic is complete, the long process of laying out the upper layers has begun.</P>
<P> "It's a labor-intensive phase," he said. "We'll take somewhere between 400 and 500
color infrared aerial photos and extract details from them. When these details are aligned to
the same points from the global positioning system, every pixel in the image will be accurate
to within 30 feet of the actual ground location."</P>
<P> The aerial photographs, from the U.S. Geological Survey, provide the resolution
needed to identify the roads, water flow and plants in the area. The researchers will produce
layers of information about the region's transportation and hydrology, and another layer will
show which plants grow where in the parks.</P>
<P> Roads are roads, but there are hundreds of different plants. Rather than picking out
every individual species in the region, the researchers developed a classification system that
identified the major plant communities found in the three parks.</P>
<P> "You have to match the classification system with what can be identified from the
aerial photographs," Remillard said. "If you were right there on the ground, you could
identify each of the species and say,  This is saw grass, and this is mule grass,' and make a list
of species, but you can't do that over the entire park. We try, first, to group the species into
associations and then the associations might be grouped together into communities." Some of
the major communities in the Everglades include wet prairie and forests of black, red and
white mangrove.</P>
<P> The vegetation groupings also indicate whether the plants in an area have been
influenced by human activities. In aerial photos, signs of humans range from agricultural fields
to all-terrain vehicle trails and even airboat tracks.</P>
<P> "I think the most difficult part is deciding what you can and can't see in a photograph
and going out in the real world and saying  Yes, what's on the photograph is what I actually
see on the ground,'" Doren said.</P>
<P> To translate the colors and textures in the aerial photos into plant communities, they
need something to work with -- a pixel-to-plant dictionary, so to speak. They have to confirm
that what they think they see in the aerial photos is actually there. "But the bigger problem is
how to figure out where we are when we're collecting this data," Welch said.</P>
<P> Welch and his colleagues at the center have addressed this problem by developing a
new procedure that links a satellite global positioning system (GPS) to a laptop computer
displaying the digital image mosaic, all while the researchers are flying around in a helicopter.</P>
<P> As the helicopter moves from location to location, its position is displayed on the
satellite image, and the center's researchers can easily find themselves on the more detailed
aerial photographs they carry with them. Then they land and visually confirm which plants
grow at that point. Back at the lab, they use this "ground truth data" to identify the plant
communities in the photos.</P>
<P> "This technique blends modern aviation, new GPS technology, digital image processing
on laptops and old-fashioned field data collection," Welch said.</P>
<P> By integrating these plant communities and remote sensing sources, the GIS database
will be a digital model of south Florida, not just a photograph. The computer functions as a
high-tech camera, taking snapshots and making maps from the layers of information in the
database.</P>
<P> Researchers can put on a wide-angle lens and see a panoramic, high-altitude satellite
view of the whole area. They can zoom in and see a smaller area, but this time in greater
detail. They can change lenses and look at the networks of roads and canals in a particular
area. If they change lenses again, they can see the plant communities that populate a specific
place.

Time-Lapse Ecology</P>
<P> While initially the project will provide a detailed and unprecedented snapshot of
Everglades National Park, Biscayne National Park, and Big Cypress National Preserve, that's
only the beginning. The park service and a host of other organizations will find it even more
useful when the GIS database can show how the parks change over time.</P>
<P> "If they have the geographic information system, the image data and a record of what's
there at one point in time, compared with either what happens in the future or compared with
historical photographs, they can get a better feeling for what might happen if they change
things," Remillard said.</P>
<P> The park service has aerial photos from years before Andrew, but the project is so
huge that park service managers will have to pick and choose which regions they want to
target for a time-lapse view. The areas most heavily damaged by Andrew, and areas where
they know pollution is entering the park, top the list, Doren said.</P>
<P> "We will take snippets of the map -- insets if you will -- and we'll monitor them over
short periods of time, and maybe we can afford once every 20 years to redo the entire map,"
he said.</P>
<P> The park service is not the only group that stands to benefit from the project. "Right
now this whole region is receiving a great deal of attention from the government," Welch said.
"It seems like every time you turn around, there's a different agency involved."</P>
<P> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will use the database, because the Florida Panther
Refuge will be included. The state of Florida and the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish
Commission also have expressed interest in the effort. The South Florida Water Management
District is cooperating with the project to create its own GIS database for an adjacent
conservation area. Even groups like the Audubon Society, for example, might be able to use it
to look at how plant communities affect the way birds forage in different habitats.</P>
<P> "I have a feeling that once it's done, a lot of universities and other organizations that
do research, including the conservation organizations, will be very interested in having a copy
of it," Doren said. "I have a feeling they'll find all kinds of uses for it."</P>
<P> It has taken a long time to get from hand-drawn vegetation maps to a precisely digitized
and flexible tool for managing the embattled plant communities of south Florida. Once the
National Park Service and other groups charged with preserving the Everglades have their
map, they will have a much better idea of where the Everglades is heading.</P>
<P> "I think it's going to be one of the most valuable management tools that we have for
the long term," Doren said. "We plan on making this map not just a static picture on the wall,
but a very dynamic, three-dimensional image. We've got nothing like that now."

<DD>Professor Kay has been a member of the faculty at Duke since 1973. His association with the Department of Geology was formally recognized in 1990, when he was appointed Professor of Geology. 

Professor Kay's current research interests center on the evolutionary history of the Order Primates. He is especially interested in further documenting the fossil history of Neotropical monkeys, whose history is particularly poorly known. Over the past five years he has conducted a program of field research in Colombia, Chile, Bolivia and Argentina to collect fossil vertebrates from Miocene continental rocks. This work has more than doubled the number of fossil specimens and the known diversity of fossil monkeys from the South American Miocene.

Professor Kay's early work concerned the functional anatomy of the primate dentition. He was among the first to apply cinefluorography to the study of jaw movements and tooth use in living primates. This provided a baseline for understanding how teeth work and the functional basis for their evolution. He has continued experimental studies of the primate dentition, the most recent of which utilizes Fourier analysis of electron micrographs in the study of dental microwear and on that basis reconstructs dietary patterns among the earliest human ancestors, the australopithecines of South Africa.

Another focus of Professor Kay's research has been the use of quantitative methods to understand the dietary adaptations of the teeth of living primates. Models developed from these various experimental and mensurational studies have been applied to the fossil record to clarify why human and other primate teeth have evolved as they have.

His research interests include the physics of blowing sand, the motion of sand dunes, the mechanics of sedimentary bedforms, and the transport of sedimentary particles by flowing water.  Field work being carried out by Dr. Haff on desert pavements in the southwest US shows that these ancient geomorphic surfaces are dynamically active today. Understanding the dynamics and history of desert pavement provides a framework for assessing the stability of these extensive desert landforms and for interpreting paleoclimatic events that have influenced their development.  Dr. Haff is also studying the effects of human disturbance on natural landscapes. Direct human impact on the landscape, in the form of road building, mining, construction of utility corridors and military maneuvers, among many other activities, is usually followed in turn by a reaction of the land surface as hydrological, biological and geological forces respond to the disturbance. Field experiments and observations are being carried out in the Mojave Desert in California in an attempt to asses the future prospects for this desert environment as human activity there continues to expand.<P> </B>

<DD>Dr. Howd joined the faculty at the Duke University Marine Laboratory in 1992 as part of the emerging Program in Ocean Sciences in the School of the Environment and holds a joint appointment in the Geology Department. Coastal North Carolina has been the site of much of Dr. Howd's research over the past 12 years and continues to provide much of the data used in his ongoing research into the physical processes responsible for beach and coastal erosion.

Dr. Howd's studies focus on the dynamics of wave and current interactions in surf zones, and how they interact with existing beach morphology to shape the future evolution of beaches and sand bars. He is currently focussing in two areas, the quantitative description of low frequency (infragravity) edge waves in the surf zone, and defining the time scales of beach profile variability.

During storms, when most beach erosion occurs, infragravity waves are known to be an important, if not dominant, energy source on most shorelines. They are also hypothesized to be responsible for controlling sand bar formation. Utilizing high resolution spectral estimators, this research is moving toward a quantitative understanding of the kinematics of these waves, and how they interact with other surf zone processes to control patterns of sediment transport. This is being pursued through a mix of field data collection and analysis, and theoretical modelling. The ultimate goal of this line of research is the prediction of short term (daily to weekly) changes in coastal morphology. This area of research also led to the discovery of a new class of nearshore waves, with dynamics based on the conservation of potential vorticity, in 1990. These waves are known as shear waves, though should not be confused with the seismic waves bearing the same name.

Beach profiles are extremely variable, responding to changing weather conditions and wave patterns. How these rapid changes, related not only to individual storm events but to sequences of storms as well, are integrated through time is also a subject of study. Using more than a decade of extremely accurate data collected at the US Army Corp of Engineers Field Research Facility in Duck, NC, this research is aimed at understanding how changing global weather patterns, in particular the frequency and severity of winter storms and hurricanes, may alter the evolution of our undeveloped shorelines. Of particular interest is the discovery that the outer surf zone profile (in water depths of 3 to 8 meters) responds at interannual, rather than annual, time scales.

<DD>Peter Malin joined Duke Geology in 1991 after more than a decade as a research seismologist at the University of Southern California and the University of California. His interests include tectonics, seismic wave propagation, and earthquakes, with current focus on central California. Since seismic waves are inseparable from the geology in which they originate and travel, his research has become increasingly interdisciplinary, emphasizing the application of structural and mechanical models to seismic observations.

Current projects at Duke include the mechanics of the San Andreas fault at Parkfield, the seismotectonics of the Coso Geothermal area, and seismic exploration of the southern Sierra Nevada, Owens Valley, and San Joaquin regions. The Duke associated downhole seismometer networks at Parkfield and Coso have revealed patterns in seismicity that suggest the interaction of aseismic and seismic fault slip. This interaction may account for the transfer of fault strain over many seismic-rupture lengths and at non- elastic speeds.

Along with several other universities, the Duke seismology group determined the location of crossed, 300 km long refraction profiles in the Sierra Nevada/Death Valley region in 1993.  The geodynamic question they address is the relationship of simultaneous Tertiary uplift of the Sierras and extension of Death Valley, which are separated by only 2 times the local crustal thickness. End member models with and without an isostatic root to the Sierras have been proposed by others. The seismic profiles have been designed to resolve between them.

Duke students and staff have joined in all aspects of these projects. The seismic networks offer the chance for hands-on study of seismicity and earthquake mechanics. The active seismic profiling projects provide experience with seismic imaging of crustal structure. <P>

<DD>Jim Clark holds joint appointments in Geology and Botany.  His research explores the factors responsible  for ecosystem patterns and how they respond to long-term changes in the physical environment, especially fire.  Current projects address i)influences of long-term climate change on fire regimes and forest composition, ii) climate and soil effects that result in spatial patterns of species composition, and iii) effects of past fire on carbon cycling and composition of the atmosphere.  Climate changes of the Quaternary have produced continent-wide transformations in biome composition and distribution.  Fire acts in concert with climate to hasten and/or modify vegetation change.  Understanding how vegetation will respond to climate changes of the future can be gained from analysis of how fire has mediated vegetation responses to climate changes of the past.  Lake sediment records of past vegetation and fire are available in the form of pollen and particulate combustion products.  Empirical analyses of sediments from North American pine, hardwood, boreal, and grassland  communities, as well as other biomes in Brazil, Siberia, and Africa are used to quantify past biomass burning and its effects on vegetation, carbon cycling and the atmosphere.
<P>
<DD>Development of new methods of analysis allow resolution of individual fires from charcoal recovered in annually laminated sediments.  Such long-term records permit reconstruction of fire regimes, distributions of intervals between fires that characterize different vegetation types.  The ways in which these distributions change when the climate changes can determine the types of plant species that persist and others that might invade.
<P>
<DD>From a large network of sites we are beginning to quantify continent-wide fluxes of carbonaceous combustion products through the past.  The geographic and temporal pattern of these fluxes helps identify past rates of combustion, emissions to the atmosphere, and the amount of carbon that might be sequestered in recalcitrant forms.  These baseline emissions estimates are being used to assess impacts of 20th century biomass burning and effects of Indian and earlier settlement activities on the distribution of burning.

<DD>Emily Klein completed her graduate studies at Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University. The primary focus of her research is the geochemistry of ocean ridge basalts, using diverse tools of major and trace element and isotopic analysis. Because ocean ridge basalts are the direct products of mantle melting, they provide a "window" into the sub-oceanic mantle. Their chemical compositions can be used to investigate physical and chemical conditions in the mantle and process of melt generation.

On a global scale, Dr. Klein has shown that world-wide variations in basalt composition correlate with both the depth of the ridge axis and the thickness of the oceanic crust. These co- variations may result from temperature variations in the mantle. Dr. Klein is currently investigating the extent to which basalt composition can be used to map mantle temperature variations and possible mantle convection patterns.

Dr. Klein's most recent sea-going expedition involved mapping and sampling of the Chile Ridge near its intersection with the Chile Trench. The overall goal of this cruise was to study the effects of ridge subduction on the composition of magmas erupted along the ridge that is being consumed. Her initial analyses of these lavas reveal a diversity of unusual chemical compositions, possibly related to proximity of the ridge to the subduction zone.

Using samples collected during ALVIN submersible dives, Dr. Klein has also examined the spatial distribution of basalt compositions to elucidate local tectonic processes, as a compliment to structural, morphologic and sedimentologic studies of the Clipperton transform-ridge system. Dr. Klein's results suggest that basalt composition can potentially be used to investigate the extent to which oceanic crust is transferred from one plate to the other within the transform fault zone.

Other on-going or recently completed projects include analysis of the first fresh ocean ridge basalts recovered from the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge; investigation of the relationship between basalt composition and physical characteristics of the ridge in the Australian-Antarctic Discordance south of Australia; and a study of the isotopic diversity of samples from the northern East Pacific Rise.

Dr. Klein has received international recognition for her original research. She was recently honored with the award of the prestigious F.W. Clarke Medal of the Geochemical Society, and she is a recipient of a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award.

Professor Heron's research interests are broad within the area of sedimentary geology. Previous studies included the Cretaceous and Tertiary clastic sequences in the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Fifteen abstracts and twenty-five articles have resulted from this area of study. More recent work has been on the Holocene history of a barrier island system on both limbs of the Cape Lookout foreland (North Carolina Outer Banks). Up until the time of this study the barrier island model was Galveston Island, Texas, a regressive barrier. Nine students have worked on this project and, in conjunction with Dr. Heron, have demonstrated that each island within the Cape Lookout sequence has a unique origin. Within a short distance of one another there are islands that are transgressive, islands that are regressive, and islands that are composed almost entirely of inlet fill. Eleven abstracts and nine publications have resulted from this study. Two studies of the clay deposits in Georgia have been funded by industry. One project looked at the clastic facies and origin of the lower Tertiary claybearing sequence. Another study has been on the economic Cretaceous clays in a mine in central Georgia. This study focused on the nature of the clay body and its vertical and lateral variations in clay mineralogy, texture, etc. 

In addition to his other departmental responsibilities, Dr. Heron is the editor-in-chief of <A HREF = "seglgy.htm">SOUTHEASTERN GEOLOGY</A> journal which is published at Duke, and Secretary-Treasurer of the <A HREF = "cgsinfo.htm">Carolina Geological  Society</A></B>.

Some of Dr. Baker's work on modern processes is done at sea utilizing oceanographic research vessels. Typically, this may include observations of pore-fluid geochemistry and sedimentology of materials collected by box coring, piston coring or deeper drilling. Some of his work on modern processes is done in the laboratory by experimental hydrothermal syntheses of common diagenetic mineral phases and observation of the conditions of their formation. His studies of ancient rocks utilize more traditional procedures: measuring and sampling of stratigraphic sections in the field and complete mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic analyses of these samples in the laboratory. Because of the diverse nature of the methodology employed for these studies, Dr. Baker (by necessity and by choice) is a geological generalist. This is also reflected in the diversity of his (and his students') present and research interests. These include the following: 1) geochemical and isotopic studies of hydrothermal sediments and fluid flow in the Middle Valley, Juan de Fuca Ridge; 2) experimental and field (Monterey Formation, CA) studies of the burial diagenesis of dolomite; 3) studies of the modern processes of off-bank carbonate sedimentation and early diagenesis on the northeastern portion of the Nicaraguan Rise in the Caribbean Sea; 4) high resolution Holocene paleoclimatic studies of the  Peruvian/Bolivian Altiplano (Lake Titicaca). <P><A HREF = "http://www.geo.duke.edu/">To Geology Department Home Page</A> </B>

    <dd>The role of ocean biogeochemical processes in the global
        carbon cycle and, particularly, the involvement of ocean
        processes in sequestering anthropogenic carbon dioxide
        are research topics which are now receiving a great deal
        of attention. A decade ago there was consensus that the
        ocean took up a quantity of carbon dioxide equal to about
        half the amount added annually to the atmosphere by human
        activities. Recent observations and models have eroded
        the old consensus and now there are several strongly
        conflicting hypotheses about where the
        &quot;missing&quot; atmospheric carbon is sequestered. To
        help answer these important questions an international
        research program, the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study
        (JGOFS), was begun. As part of JGOFS a number of field
        experiments were carried out. My research group has
        participated in or is now actively participating in the
        following cruises as part of the JGOFS program:
        Equatorial Pacific Process Study, 1992; Iron Enrichment
        Experiment, 1993; Arabian Sea Process Study, 1995; Iron
        Enrichment Experiment-II, 1995; and Southern Ocean
        Process Study, 1996-1998. In each of these efforts, the
        work of my research group has focused on the role of
        physical conditions in regulating primary production and
        phytoplankton performance. We use three methods to
        measure primary productivity and its response to
        environmental conditions: in situ incubations, deck
        incubations and photosynthesis-irradiance experiments.
        The observed relationships are used in models to gain a
        predictive understanding of the role of oceanic primary
        productivity in the global carbon cycle. </dd>

    <dd>An example of our current interest is expressed in the
        following abstract of currently proposed research
        project, Modeling New and Export Productivity in the
        Global Ocean. </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dd>Predictive understanding of the ocean's role in global
        climate requires, among other things, the ability to
        specify the flux of carbon between the atmosphere, the
        surface mixed layer and the deep ocean. Understanding the
        factors that regulate new and export productivity and how
        these properties will vary in response to natural or
        anthropogenic climate perturbations isone element of
        specifying the carbon flux. As a contribution towards
        this predictive understanding, we propose to estimate new
        and export productivity at annual and seasonal time
        scales in the global ocean using a single upper ocean
        ecosystem model embedded in a state-of-the-art three
        dimensional circulation and mixing model of the global
        ocean. The domain of the model is the entire oceanic
        region seaward of the shelf break (depths &gt; 200 m),
        specifically excluding, in this phase of modeling,
        continental shelves, margins and enclosed seas. Both new
        production, the synthesis of new dissolved and
        particulate organic matter fueled by nitrate advected or
        mixed into the euphotic zone, and export productivity,
        the flux of newly synthesized dissolved and particulate
        organic matter through the 100 m and 200 m depth
        horizons, will be estimated. The massively parallel
        supercomputer capabilities at the Jet Propulsion
        Laboratory (JPL) (256 processors) and the North Carolina
        Supercomputing Center (NCSC) (64 processors) together
        with order of magnitude advances in mass storage make it
        possible to develop a global, three dimensional,
        prognostic ocean model and rapidly conduct many model
        experiments on new and export productivity in a timely
        and efficient manner. Rapid iterations enable us to
        investigate how new and export productivity changes in
        response to variations in wind and thermal forcing as
        well as to relatively small changes in ecosystem
        components regulating photosynthetic performance and
        grazing loss rates. Significant export of biogenic
        particulate material from the upper ocean requires both
        enhanced productivity and the accumulation of
        phytoplankton biomass followed by massive sinking of the
        bloom. Because phytoplankton accumulation is particularly
        sensitive to the grazing loss rate, the model will
        incorporate size-dependent grazing vulnerability and
        differential reproductive rates for micro- and
        mesozooplankton. This study will test the hypothesis that
        a single ecosystem model with size structure in
        phytoplankton and zooplankton populations can reproduce
        observed oceanic properties of new productivity, biomass,
        and export flux for all biogeochemical provinces of the
        world ocean. We focus on how physiological limitations
        affect photosynthetic performance and size-dependent
        growth rate producing differential grazing losses and the
        resultant accumulation of blooms of large phytoplankton
        that can sink rapidly. This work will provide estimates
        of the annual mean and seasonal variability of global new
        and export productivity, but more importantly it will
        show with high resolution when and where significant
        export takes place. The ability to model present-day new
        and export productivity accurately, with a single
        globally robust ocean model, is an objective that must be
        accomplished to achieve our long range goal. That goal is
        the ability to predict how anthropogenically forced
        climate variability will alter the biogenic flux out of
        the surface ocean and, hence, alter the magnitude and
        distribution of partial pressure difference of CO2
        (DpCO2) between the atmosphere and the surface ocean.</dd>

<p>Chai, F., S. T. Lindley, R. T. Barber and J. T. Toggweiler (in
press) Testing the iron limitation and the role of zooplankton
grazing in the equatorial Pacific, a physical-biological model
study. Deep-Sea Research II. </p>

<p>A five-component ecosystem model was embedded into an ocean
general circulation model for the equatorial Pacific, and the
physical-biological model was used to test the iron limitation on
phytoplankton growth and the role of zooplankton grazing in the
equatorial Pacific Ocean. With respect to phytoplankton uptake,
the residence time of surface nitrate in the central equatorial
Pacific is about 5 months. The upper bound of surface nitrate
concentration (in case without biological uptake) in the central
Pacific is about 15 mmol m-3. Model results suggest that if the
equatorial Pacific Ocean were micronutrient replete, the maximum
nitrate concentration would be reduced by half from its present
value, and the area of high nitrate surface water would also be
reduced. The tightly coupled phytoplankton growth and zooplankton
grazing resulted in a doubling of zooplankton biomass and a
slightly increase of phytoplankton standing stocks after the a
and Pmax were doubled. Model results also indicate that iron
limitation or other physiological limitations set the value of
nitrate concentration in the nutrient-rich plume and create
north-south asymmetry in the nutrient fields. Surface nitrate
distribution in the model was improved by including the spatial
pattern of eolian iron flux implicitly in the model of primary
production calculation. The model experiments suggest that the
ratio of the maximum zooplankton specific grazing rate to the
maximum phytoplankton specific growth rate should be between 0.5
and 0.75, and the model performance is very sensitive to this
ratio. Reducing (or increasing) this ratio in the model results
in poor comparisons between the modeled surface nitrate
concentration and the observations. This indicates that
phytoplankton growth and zooplankton grazing are tightly coupled
in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. </p>

<p>The cycling of carbon in the equatorial Pacific Ocean was
investigated by the Equatorial Pacific (EqPac) Study in 1992. As
part of that study in situ primary productivity was measured on
survey and time series cruises along 140W from 12N to 12S
with methods determined to be trace metal clean. Primary
productivity, chlorophyll and chlorophyll-specific productivity
rates varied coherently in relation to two large scale features:
temporally, primary productivity was reduced during the El Nio
dominated period (February to April 1992) and increased during
the cool period (August to October 1992); and spatially, enhanced
primary productivity persisted close to the equator relative to
the oligotrophic regions poleward of 10N and 10S. On the
equator in October 1992 during the period of relatively cool
water, primary productivity was about twice (125 mmol C m-2
day-1) the value during the height of the warm period (60 mmol C
m-2 day-1). The climatological mean equatorial productivity in
the cold tongue has been recalculated to be about 75 mmol C m-2
day-1 (Chavez et al., 1996). The mean 1992 productivity on the
equator (1S to 1N) was about 25% higher than climatology (95
versus 75 mmol C m-2 day-1) and about three times the value in
oligotrophic waters poleward of 10N and 10S (95 versus 30
mmol C m-2 day-1). Higher chlorophyll-specific productivity
during the cool period relative to the warm period (3.9 versus
2.4 mmol C mg Chl-1 day-1) indicates that the increase in
absolute productivity did not result solely from a biomass
increase, but from a change in the nutrient regulated specific
productivity rate. The regulating nutrient was not a
macronutrient, such as nitrate or silicic acid, because
macronutrients (and light) were present in uptake-saturating
concentrations during both the warm and cool periods of the 1992
EqPac study. Physiological constraint by a micronutrient, such as
iron, is implicated as the factor regulating these productivity
variations. The change in iron supply resulted from a change in
equatorial circulation processes. During the warm period,
ENSO-driven changes in pycnocline topography depressed the
Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), thereby decreasing the amount of
iron-rich EUC water entrained into equatorial upwelling and vice
versa during the cool period. During the August to October cool
period of generally increased productivity, two further episodic
increases in specific productivity, biomass and diatom abundance
occurred during intense and remotely forced upwelling events
associated with a front or the passage of a frontal wave. In both
mesoscale episodes, temperature and salinity show that the
intensified upwelling reached more deeply into the already
relatively shallow EUC. Productivity and biomass increases during
both of these events were quantitatively similar to those in an
in situ iron addition experiment (IronEx) carried out in
equatorial Pacific waters in 1993. Variations in the supply of
upwelled iron provided by the iron-rich EUC best account for the
warm/cool period difference in phytoplankton productivity as well
as the episodic increases in specific productivity, biomass and
diatom abundance during intense mesoscale upwelling events seen
in the dynamic equatorial region in the EqPac study.</p>

Iron and grazing constraints on primary production in the central
equatorial Pacific: An EqPac synthesis. Limnol. Oceanogr.</p>

<p>Recent studies in the equatorial Pacific, including the JGOFS
EqPac Program,IRONEX, FeLine and others, have provided the most
comprehensive data todate for assessing the roles andinteractions
of iron limitation and zooplankton grazing in
suppressingphytoplankton production in a high nutrient, low
chlorophyll (HNLC)ecosystem. The main source of iron input to the
central equatorial Pacificis upwelling from the Equatorial
Undercurrent. Iron concentrations in near-surface watersare about
30 pM, well below the 120 pM half-saturation constant for
theportion of the community that grows most rapidly in response
to ironenrichment. Moreover, the trend in thequantum yield of
photosynthesis suggests that even the community dominantsin the
equatorial region and southern subtropical Pacific are held below
their physiological potential by chronic iron deficiency.
Microzooplanktongrazingdominated phytoplankton removal processes
throughout the EqPac study,accounting for virtually all of the
measured phytoplankton productionduring an El Nio period when
most phytoplankton cells were very small,and 66 to 91% of the
losses duringnormal upwelling. Grazing by mesozooplankton
(14-19%) and lateral advection (10-14%) also contributed
significantly to phytoplankton losses during normal upwelling.
During both periods,good agreement was found between growth and
losses of phytoplankton,confirming a grazer-dominated balance.
The new production f-ratio wasrelatively low in equatorial waters
(0.07 to 0.12), and nitrate uptake wasstrongly correlated to
thepigment biomass of diatoms. Iron budgets for the El Nio and
upwellingperiods are consistent with the notion that new
production depends on therate of new iron input to the system via
upwelling while the magnitude oftotal production depends on the
efficient recycling of iron by grazers. TheEqPac synthesis
suggests that iron limitation and grazing balance functionjointly
to constrain standing stocks and production rates of
phytplanktonin equatorial waters. Except for the limiting
substrate itself (i.e., iron vs. macronutrient), theinteractions
of resource limitation and grazing in HNLC regions
areconceptually similar to the generally accepted view of
ecosystem functionin oligotrophic subtropical oceans.In both
cases, the phytoplankton are substrate limited; they are
dominated by small forms which grow at rapid, butusually less
than physiologically maximal rates; they are cropped to lowstable
abundances by microzooplankton grazers; and their sustained
growthis dependent on the remineralized by-products of grazing.</p>

<p>The Arabian Sea Process Study carried out on six cruises in
1995 provided observations that make possible the ground truthing
of model estimates of kPAR and on deck productivity incubations
with direct kPAR observations and in situ productivity
incubations. The Morel 1988 optical model did a good job of
reproducing the observed values (Obs. = 0.994 Modeled + 0.004; r2
= 0.75). Comparison of on deck and in situ depth profiles
suggested that on deck incubators received more irradiance across
the entire light gradient. This subsidy in E0 apparently came
from efficient absorption of reflected light and low angle
sunlight by small (30 x 20 x 20 cm) incubators. When depths were
recalculated taking into account the irradiance subsidy, profiles
of productivity as a function of depth determined by on deck
incubations were essentially identical to in situ profiles.</p>

maintenance of high nitrate condition in the equatorial Pacific.
Deep-Sea Research II, 43, 1031-1064.</p>

<p>The physical and biological causes for the nutrient anomaly
were investigated using an ecosystem model embedded within an
ocean general circulation model to determine the nitrate budget
for the equatorial Pacific Ocean. In the 140W region the
effects of mixing on nitrate fluxes were small compared to the
effects of advection; upwelling and zonal transport to the east
in the Equatorial Undercurrent were the major fluxes. On the
equator annual JNO3, the total physical flux of nitrate to the
euphotic layer, was 3.76 mmol m 2 d 1; the new production
estimated independently by the ecosystem model was 3.36 mmol m 2
d 1 or, in carbon units, 22.26 mmol C m 2 d 1. Model experiments
indicated that iron limitation of phytoplankton was not necessary
for maintenance of a high-nutrient plume; that is, the plume of
high nitrate water can be generated solely by physics. However,
these results indicate that iron limitation or other
physiological limitations set the concentration of nitrate in the
nutrient-rich plume and create north-south asymmetry in the
nutrient fields. Our results suggest that if the equatorial
Pacific Ocean were micronutrient replete, the maximum nitrate
concentration would be reduced by half from its present
concentration.</p>

<p>Primary productivity has been measured in the highly variable
Arabian Sea off the coast of Oman on four cruises in 1995 as part
of the US-JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study. Cruises have sampled
the winter northeast monsoon, spring intermonsoon, and summer
southwest monsoon (two cruises); two more in fall 1995 will
sample the fall intermonsoon. In situ productivity determined
according to JGOFS protocols was concentrated on a section that
ran offshore in southeasterly direction for 1000 km to 14.5N
and 65E, then southerly along 65E to 10N. this section was
intended to sample the coastal upwelling, offshore upwelling and
permanently oligotrophic regions of the Arabian Sea. the lowest
values observed during the first four cruises was 50 mmol C m 2 d
1 at the 10N, 65E station. The highest value was about 150
mmol C m 2 d 1 at an offshore station about 700 km from the
coast. During the first SW monsoon cruise in July/August
productivity was relatively high across the entire section,
averaging about 130 mmol C m 2 d 1. The large-scale increase in
productivity during the SW monsoon was evident and the increase
was most pronounced at offshore stations. Arabian Sea
productivity is about twice that in the equatorial Pacific and
was coupled on the scale of hundreds of kilometers to the
seasonal wind variability.</p>

<p>The annual cycle of monsoon-driven variability in primary
productivity was studied in 1995 in the Arabian Sea as part of
the US-JGOFS. The SW Monsoon in 1995 was consistent in timing and
intensity with the climatological (1911-1970) average, and the
winds during the remainder of the year were similar to average
conditions. Physical conditions, nutrients and in situ
productivity were analyzed along the southern JGOFS section from
the coast of Oman to about 1000 km offshore and at a presumably
oligotrophic oceanic station at 10N, 65E. During the NE
Monsoon in January 1995 there was relatively deep convective
mixing associated with high nutrients offshore. In contrast,
during the SW Monsoon cool water and nutrients were most evident
close to the coast but persisted offshore to about 800 km. As
expected, the SW Monsoon was the most productive season with
average productivity of 1516  141 mg Cm-2d-1. Mean productivity
in the NE Monsoon was 1085  78; during the spring transition,
1029  66; and during the fall transition, 967  196 mg Cm
2d-1. There was surprisingly little onshore/offshore gradient in
productivity out to 1000 km. The 10N, 65E station had the
lowest productivity (634  105 mg Cm-2d-1 ), a value that is
considerably higher than those of oligotrophic regions in the
tropical Pacific or Atlantic Oceans. With a mean non-SW Monsoon
productivity of about 1000 mg Cm 2d-1 and a SW Monsoon average of
about 1500 mg Cm 2d 1, the time weighted annual mean productivity
for this region was surprisingly high at 1125 mg Cm-2d-1, an
annual mean about equal to both the spring bloom found during the
1989 NABE and the equatorial maximum value in the central Pacific
during the 1992 EqPac study.</p>

<p>Paper presented at ASLO Aquatic Sciences Meeting, Santa Fe,
February 1997: IRON IN OPEN OCEAN SYSTEMS AND THE CHANGING
PICTURE OF OCEANIC NUTRIENT DYNAMICS </p>

<p>Barber, R. T., Duke University, Nicholas School of the
Environment, 135 Duke Marine Lab Road, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA</p>

<p>The role of iron in open ocean food web processes has gained
wide attention as a result of the two iron addition experiments
that John Martin set in motion. The in situ iron addition
experiments, IronEx-I in 1993 and IronEx-II in 1995, dramatically
changed how iron and phytoplankton production are understood.
Martin will always be credited with this altered view of nutrient
regulation in the ocean, but other researchers working in
tropical and polar waters were independently uncovering the
nutrient role of iron. Recent results extend to other parts of
the food web; for example, iron limitation regulates growth
efficiency of heterotrophic bacteria. Through an impact on the
size structure of primary producers, iron affects the abundance
of mesozooplankton grazers relative to micrograzers. The grazer
connection may cascade through the food web to determine
recruitment success. Most importantly, iron supply may limit the
magnitude of nitrogen fixation in nutrient-poor waters with the
result that fixed nitrogen, not phosphate, regulates global
productivity on geologic scales. This presentation will outline
the changing picture of oceanic nutrient dynamics.</p>

IRON AND OTHER NUTRIENTS</p>

<p>Barber, R. T., Duke University, Nicholas School of the
Environment, 135 Duke Marine Lab Road, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA</p>

<p>Two successful iron-addition experiments have been carried
out, in 1993 and 1995, in the high nutrient, low chlorophyll
waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Results from
these experiments will be presented to show the variability of
oceanic response. Prospects for future open ocean experiments
also will be discussed. A major nutrient addition experiment has
been proposed for the Sargasso Sea and an iron/nutrient addition
experiment is being contemplated for the central Gulf of Mexico.
In addition, a major British effort to carry out a Southern Ocean
iron addition experiment is being planned. The size, location,
mechanics of enrichment, and duration of these oceanic
manipulations will be compared.</p>

<DD>After completing postdoctoral studies at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Susan Lozier joined Duke in 
the spring of 1992. As a physical oceanographer her research interests lie in the general area of mesoscale and large scale ocean dynamics.
 Her research approach ranges from the application of numerical models to the analysis of observational data, with the focus on the testing and
 development of theory.
In an effort to understand the distribution of heat, carbon dioxide and other properties in our oceans, Dr. Lozier has
 recently been studying property exchange mechanisms across oceanic fronts, such as the Gulf Stream. Her contributions have specifically
 focused on the Lagrangian aspects of exchange through the elucidation of property changes along the path of water parcels. In this endeavor 
Dr. Lozier has tracked particle paths within a general circulation numerical model and has analyzed the trajectories of observational floats
 released in the Gulf Stream. From the combination of these studies the role of potential vorticity as the primary dynamic constraint on exchange
 has been established.
Currently, Dr. Lozier is also focusing on the climatology of the North Atlantic. Using hydrographic station data from the
 past century she has just completed a climatological atlas for this basin. Significant recirculations in the abyssal ocean have been revealed
by this database. These recirculations impact current ideas about the transport and age of the deep waters in this basin. Having established 
the mean climatology her focus is now on a determination of the climatic variability of the Atlantic. Of particular interest are how atmospheric 
perturbations penetrate into the ocean interior, how climatic variability is propagated through the ocean and how feedback mechanism affect
 these changes.

the behavior of replenished beaches and the coastal response to engineering

structures. There is, however, no evidence that such models have succeeded

<H4>THE WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, NORTH CAROLINA SHOREFACE: NOT AN EQUILIBRIUM PROFILE</H4>

(GSA Abstracts with Programs, v. 27, no. 6, p. A-78.)<P>



THIELER, E. R.; PILKEY, O. H., Department of Geology, Duke University,

Campus Box 90228, Durham, NC 27708-0228; CLEARY, W. J., Department of Earth

Sciences, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, NC 28403; RIGGS, S. R.,

Department of Geology, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858.<P>



        An extensive database of subbottom profiles, sidescan sonar data,

percussion cores and vibracores has been collected on the shoreface and

inner continental shelf off Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. The

shoreface can be divided into four morphological and sedimentary zones: 1)

a sandy northern end, where the sediment cover is fine to very-fine sand;

2) a coarse-grained southern end, where much of the exposed surface

sediment is sand-to-gravel sized shell hash and quartz, and bathymetry and

processes are controlled by antecedent topography in the form of

shoreface-oblique Pleistocene ridges and outcrops of Plio-Pleistocene

limestone; 3) a nearshore zone, extending offshore approximately 1 km from

the beach, consisting of numerous 40-100 m wide, 1 m deep

shore-perpendicular rippled scour depressions floored by coarse, rippled

sand, gravel and shell hash; and 4) an offshore zone of relict

shore-oblique ridges, coarse on their landward sides and covered on their

seaward flanks by thin veneers of fine sand, at approximately 10-15 m

depth.<P>

        Field evidence from the Wrightsville Beach shoreface demonstrates

that a shoreface equilibrium profile as defined by Dean (1991) and others

does not exist here. The morphology of this shoreface is dictated by the

underlying geologic framework, rather than simple sediment diffusion due to

wave-energy gradients.  The geologic framework also appears to influence

the rate and character of shoreface sedimentation. The most important

practical implication for the study of interactions between beach,

shoreface and inner shelf environments (e.g., for the design of beach

replenishment projects) here is that  a number of the assumptions required

by existing analytical and numerical models of coastal evolution (e.g.,

Dean, 1991; GENESIS; SBEACH) cannot be met.<P>

<H4>DO RIPPLED SCOUR DEPRESSIONS ON THE INNER SHELF INDICATE NET CROSS-SHORE

(SEAWARD) SEDIMENT TRANSPORT?</H4>

(Proceedings, the 1st SEPM Congress on Sedimentary Geology, St. Petersburg,

Florida.)<P>



E. R. Thieler (Duke University, Department of Geology, Campus Box 90228,

Durham, NC 27708-0228)<P>



  Rippled scour depressions - elongate, shore-normal, low-relief

depressions floored by coarse, rippled sediments - are relatively common

features in modern inner shelf environments. Examples also exist in the

rock record (e.g., the Middle Triassic, Upper Muschelkalk in southwestern

Germany). The genesis of rippled scour depressions is generally attributed

to storm-induced downwelling currents or seaward-directed storm-surge ebb

currents. Very little information exists, however, on whether these

features indicate a net seaward flux of sediment at time scales greater

than a few hours or days.<P>

  A suite of vibracores and repeated sidescan-sonar surveys from the inner

shelf off Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina indicates that rippled scour

depressions may act as conduits for the seaward transport of sediment. A

petrographically distinct material used for beach replenishment over the

past 40 yr can be traced from the beach and upper shoreface to the shelf

(water depths 3-15 m). It is hypothesized that during storms, enhanced

bottom stresses produced by an intensified quasi-steady current (such as a

downwelling current) and wave-induced oscillatory flows form the elongate

rippled scour depressions and transport sediment seaward. These bedforms

are probably maintained during fair-weather conditions by winnowing created

by the greater surface roughness within the depressions.<P>

  The dispersal pattern of the replenishment sediment is strikingly similar

to the bathymetric and sedimentary fabrics determined by geophysical

surveys. In particular, the coarse shell fraction of the fill appears to be

concentrated in the rippled scour depressions. This and other evidence

demonstrate that the depressions act as pathways for net sediment transport

from the upper shoreface to the shelf, and provide a decadal-scale view of

beach-shelf coupling.<P>

<H4>An Overview of Geologic and Oceanographic Assumptions Required by Coastal

Engineering Models, and Suggested Alternatives to Models</H4><P>

(Proceedings, Coastal Zone '95, p. 128-129)<P>



O. H. Pilkey, E. R. Thieler, R. S. Young, and D. M. Bush (Duke University,

Department of Geology, Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines,

Campus Box 90228, Durham, NC 27708-0228  USA)<P>



        Analytical and numerical models are becoming widely used to predict

the behavior of replenished beaches and the coastal response to engineering

structures. There is, however, no evidence that such models have succeeded

in their intended predictive role. A significant part of the problem is

that these models are wholly deterministic in nature. They produce results

with unknown and non-quantifiable error. We feel that this approach needs

re-examination.<P>

        Many of the assumptions used in analytical and numerical models are

not valid in the context of modern oceanographic and geologic principles.

It essential that beach designers understand these model limitations. It is

our belief that models should not be relied on as a primary design tool

until they have been substantially modified and proven in real-world

situations. This paper identifies some of the major weaknesses present in

coastal engineering models, describes model limitations for several

frequently-applied models, and presents three alternatives for replenished

beach design that are not model-dependent.<P>

        Mathematical models of beach behavior are heavily relied upon in

the design of beach replenishment and coastal engineering projects; yet,

there is a great discrepancy between the predicted beach behavior produced

by the models and the reality of actual beach behavior. Some of the problem

is rooted in politics but more important is the unreality of analytical and

numerical models used in the design process. The typical assumptions used

to simplify the model equations are often highly questionable (e.g., the

existence of closure depth), processes are generalized and incomplete

(ignoring seaward flowing bottom currents), models are assumed to apply to

all beaches (a shoreface with outcropping rock is treated no differently

than a shoreface covered with unconsolidated sand), and adequate real world

data (e.g., wave gauge information) is generally lacking. In addition, the

model approach used in U.S. coastal engineering design is non-probabilistic

- in effect, storms are considered to be unpredictable accidents. They are

not directly accounted for in most models.<P>

        The track record of model use is poor and we recommend that models

should be shelved for real-world applications while recognizing their

potential usefulness in basic coastal science. Pilkey et al. (1994)

suggested three alternatives to models: 1) determine beachfill requirements

by measuring volume loss and profile shape changes over a period of years;

assume similar behavior for the replenished beach ("imitate nature"); 2)

place sand on the beach without design predictions and monitor the beach

for volume loss and sediment dispersal ("see what happens"); and 3) design

beaches based on past experience on the same, neighboring or regional

beaches ("past experience").<P>

        Imitate Nature. The basis of this approach to replenished beach

design is to determine the history of behavior of the natural beach and

shoreface system and from this assume the behavior of the replenished

beach. Verhagen (1992) describes the Dutch approach which is basically an

imitation of nature.<P>

        See What Happens. This approach involves beach emplacement on a

trial basis without any particular design effort other than planning

methods of the spreading sand pumped up on the beach, and conducting

physical monitoring of beach evolution. This approach avoids the often

heavy design costs common on replenished beach projects. Because beach

design with mathematical models produces a beach of unknowable durability,

the no-design approach may be just as successful.<P>

        Past Experience. Pilkey (1988) suggested a "thumbnail method" for

use in estimating long-term sediment volume requirements on the U.S. East

Coast. It is based on the largely empirical regional beach durability

experience from past replenishment projects. Pilkey (1988) suggests using

the following relationship:<P>



                Vl = (X/n)v                                       (1)<P>



where Vl is the total volume of sand required to maintain a design beach of

a given length (l), n is the assumed interval required for major

restoration (for Florida, n = 9 years, for New Jersey, n = 3 years, and n=5

for the rest of the East Coast barrier islands), X is the desired project

life or design life, and v is the volume of initial fill placed along beach

of length (l).<P>

        The factor n in Eqn. (1) is based on Table 1 in Pilkey (1988),

which is a summary of beach replenishment performance on U.S. East Coast

beaches. With increased experience in replenishment of neighboring beaches,

the factor should be adjusted accordingly. Previous experience on the same

beach should provide the most accurate barometer of all for prediction

beach response and lifespan; the more nourishments, the more useful. In

addition, the success in using previous experience as a design guide will

depend in large part on the quality and extent of physical monitoring of

beaches.<P>

        The Bruun Rule (Bruun, 1962) remains the basis for most

mathematical models used to predict the rate of retreat of shorelines due

to sea-level rise, and is also the basis of the concept of the shoreface

profile of equilibrium. According to the Bruun Rule, the shoreface profile

responds to sea-level rise by moving landward and upward such that the

profile remains constant down to a depth of no wave influence (beyond which

little sediment is supposedly transported). The rule effectively states

that shoreface slope is the only control of shoreline retreat and that for

a given sea-level rise, beaches with gentle shorefaces will recede faster

than those with steep shorefaces. In actual application retreat rates are

based on the slope of the shoreface rather than the slope of the migration

surface. As a result, on East Coast shorefaces the Bruun Rule usually

predicts a sea-level rise to shoreline retreat ratio of 1:200. But the

retreat occurs across the surface of the lower coastal plain, the slope of

which in North Carolina averages about 1:2000.<P>

        The rule is also flawed in its assumptions concerning areal

restriction of sediment movement on shorefaces, and in its lack of

consideration for geologic control of shoreface slope. In actual use, the

assumption of the depth of no wave motion (closure depth) has decreased to

between 4 and 8 m on East Coast shorefaces, in contrast to Bruun's original

18 to 20 m depth assumption. There is no basis in reality for using the

Bruun Rule, as it is currently being used, to predict shoreline retreat

rates. It is probably a mistake to assume that any single model of

shoreline recession will have universal applicability in view of the wide

variation in geologic and oceanographic settings of the worlds coasts.

Models of shoreline retreat prediction should be based on local settings

settings. Using North Carolina examples, locally oriented models of

shoreline retreat are discussed.<P>

<DD>Jeff Karson joined the Duke faculty in January 1986 after 7 years as a member of the scientific staff at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The central theme of his research is structural and tectonic analysis of rift and transform plate boundaries. His approach involves the systematic collection of geological data in order to determine the geometry, chronology, and mode of formation of outcrop-scale deformation structures and their relation to crustal processes that operate on a regional scale. In order to gain insights into the evolution of rifts and transforms, Dr. Karson has worked in several different environments. In the East African Rift System, detailed structural studies define the geometry and kinematics of active rifting and the birth of a rifted continental margin. Investigations of the ocean-continent transition and coastal dike swarms of  the Tertiary East Greenland volcanic rifted margin are underway in collaboration with the Danish Lithosphere Center. Along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and East Pacific Rise, spreading centers and intervening transform faults are examined from the perspective of the submersible ALVIN and various other seafloor mapping tools. Studies of ophiolite complexes, ancient oceanic lithosphere exposed in mountain belts, reveal the deep structure of crust and upper mantle produced by seafloor spreading. Integrating these diverse studies has proven to be useful in developing new models of crustal deformation in extensional and strike-slip tectonic regimes. These studies are undertaken with the collaboration of geophysicists, petrologists, and geochemists in order to help understand the interplay of various geologic processes during deformation.

<P>
Dear Colleagues:
</P>
<P>  
The 22nd Assateague Shelf and Shore Workshop will be held on Friday and Saturday, April 26 and 27, 1996, at the Duke University Marine Lab in Beaufort, North Carolina, on the beautiful Crystal Coast. Friday's program will consist of <A HREF="http://www.geo.duke.edu/assw22_program.html">18 technical presentations</A> (15 minute talks plus 5 minutes for questions) on a wide variety of coastal topics. This year's program includes talks on coastal process studies, the Quaternary geologic framework of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, barrier islands and continental shelf, estuarine sedimentation, and applied studies on coastal issues such as groundwater effects on beach erosion, heavy metal accumulation in coastal lagoons, as well as beach and inlet management. The program will run from 8:30am to 5:00pm.
</P>

<P>  
Two field trips are offered on Saturday that are designed to allow attendees to choose between a northerly ending destination (the northern Outer Banks near Nags Head) and a southerly ending destination (Fort Fisher, near Wilmington). The trips will emphasize the importance of geologic framework in local and regional coastal processes, and the coastal management challenges it presents. Several recent studies on the North Carolina coast have focused on the role of nearshore geologic framework in coastal evolution. We are beginning to realize that each portion of the coast evolves differently, based on the nearshore geology. This variable framework provides a basis for implementing a variety of management options for property damage mitigation, development and land use planning, and assessing the viability of engineering solutions.
</P>

<P>
The northern field trip will begin on Ocracoke Island (via the Cedar Island  Ocracoke Ferry) and proceed north along the Outer Banks, with stops at Cape Hatteras, Rodanthe, Pea Island NWR, Oregon Inlet, Nags Head, Kitty Hawk, and the spectacular dunes at Jockey's Ridge State Park. This is one of the most diverse and most famous coastal environments on the East Coast. The present-day barrier islands are hung on and largely controlled by the antecedent geologic framework. We will see numerous examples of the major conflict between rapid geomorphic change and a nearly immobile human imprint. We will also drive on the newly relocated portions of NC Highway 12, which is NC DOT's first attempt to retreat due to shoreline erosion. The trip will be led by Stan Riggs of East Carolina University, and run until 6:00pm.
</P>

<P>
The southern field trip will begin on Bogue Banks and proceed south. Stops will include several on Bogue Banks, Bogue Inlet, Onslow Beach, Topsail Island, Wrightsville Beach (one of the most-sampled shorefaces in North Carolina), and the newly constructed, massive seawall at Fort Fisher. The stop at Onslow Beach provides a rare opportunity to see this undeveloped island, which is owned by the U.S. Marine Corps. North Topsail Island is home to some of the most hazard-prone development on the East Coast, and is located in a CBRA zone to boot. The trip will be led by Orrin Pilkey and Rob Thieler of Duke University and Bill Cleary of UNC-Wilmington, and run until 6:00pm.
</P>

<P>
As customary with past field trips, attendees should plan to drive their own vehicles, and depart for home from the ending point of each trip. Those going on the northern trip should make reservations for their vehicles on the NC DOT's Cedar Island to Ocracoke Ferry, which departs Cedar Island (a 60 minute drive from Beaufort) at 7:00am. The reservation number is (919) 225-3551 or 1-800-BY-FERRY. The fare is $10 per vehicle, including passengers. A University van will accompany each trip, and return to Beaufort that evening. This allows the first 10 registrants who request transportation on either trip to return to Beaufort. Registrants coming from northern areas who will be on the southern trip may wish to stay a night in the Wilmington area before returning home. Nearly all the major hotel chains are represented in the area; two are listed on the <A HREF="http://www.geo.duke.edu/assw22_hotels2.html">places to stay</A> page.
</P>

<P>
Registration is required for all attending the meeting and/or a field trip. Meeting and trip registration is $30 per person (preregistration ended on March 26) and will cover costs such as the meeting facilities for Friday, production of the technical program and field trip guide book, refreshments on Friday and box lunches on Saturday. The attached registration form should be completed and returned with your payment as soon as possible. On-site registration is also available on Friday.
</P>

<P>
The Duke Marine Lab is located on Pivers Island, just off Highway US 70 East between Morehead City and Beaufort. Information on motel accommodations in the vicinity of the Duke Marine Lab is available on the <A HREF="http://www.geo.duke.edu/assw22_hotels2.html">places to stay</A> page. Prices are estimates and should be confirmed when you make reservations. Early reservations are advised, since the annual <I>Beaufort Music Festival</I> is also taking place this weekend. Music lovers take note!
</P>

<P>
If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Rob Thieler. Also, please feel free to share this announcement with others who may be new to ASSW. We are looking forward to seeing you at the 22nd Assateague Shelf and Shore Workshop on April 26 and 27.</P>

<H2>HYDROLOGY RESEARCH WITHIN & ADJACENT TO DUKE FOREST</H2>

<P>



<HR>



</CENTER>

<BODY>
<H3>In addition to hydrology research performed by Duke University
scientists throughout the world, four local hydrology research sites exists
on or adjacent to the Duke University campus.  These sites provide a unique
opportunity to incorporate research problems into class work.  On campus, a
network of rain gages, pressure transducers, weirs and data loggers have
been strategically located to provide data to a calibrated kinematic wave
model of storm water runoff.  This model is used to predict flows and water
quality on over 1400 acres of Duke University.  Within the adjacent Duke
Forest, an extensive array of micrometerological equipment is used to
monitor gas exchange in the forest canopy and forest soil.  Also within the
Duke Forest, a contaminated groundwater research facility contains 15 wells
that are monitored with automated sensors;  pumping tests and extensive
geophysical surveys have been performed at this site.  Paired, 25 acre
natural watersheds have been gauged and monitored continuously since
1991.</H3>

<B>FAULT GUIDED WAVES AT MIDDLE MT, PARKFIELD, CA: SEGMENTATION VERSUS SOURCE EFFECTS.</B><P>

Malin, P.E. and Stroujkova, A.F., Department Geology, Box 90235, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708-0235.<p>

        Three-component seismograms from the Parkfield downhole network on the San
 Andreas fault show unusual arrivals in the post S-wave time window.  It has been 
suggested that these arrivals are fault guided waves.  We believe that we have 
identified both Love and Rayleigh type fault guided waves at the Middle Mt. downhole 
station.  Both wave types have unique radiation patterns and their propagation depends
 on the continuity and degree of homogeneity of the fault between the source and 
receiver.  We have been mapping the locations of events producing these waves, 
initially using a simple station-delay model and finally UC Berkeley's  joint velocity 
and location model.<P>



        The locations of events producing the guide waves can not be explained in terms 
of either simple radiation patterns or fault geometry and elastic properties alone.  
Decomposition of the hypocentral map into regions, which were then fit with quadratic surfaces, suggest segmentation of the  San Andreas fault beneath Middle Mt.  On the other hand, amplitudes and polarizations of some of the arrivals appear consistent with fault guided wave radiation patterns.  The contributions of source effects versus fault segmentation may be resolved by the fault zone drilling project currently being planned for the Middle Mt. area.

<B>Aseismic slip in earthquake nucleation and self-similarity: some evidence from Parkfield, CA</B><p>     

Moritz Heimpel & Peter Malin<P>

Aseismic slip, microearthquakes, and moderate earthquakes all take place along the San Andreas fault at Parkfield, CA.  In this paper we discuss the connection of these slip mechanisms by establishing and modeling the local microeathquake size-frequency
 distribution.  By examining the effect of background noise on event detection, we show
 the distribution is complete for M>0.3.  Unlike the Gutenburg-Richter law, the 
distribution begins with a relatively small number of very small events.  Further, the 
scaling relation of the distribution changes continuous with event size.  Noting that
 many Parkfield aseismic slip (or "creep") events have moments equivalent to the
 smaller microearthquakes, we show that the nucleation of microeathquakes by this
 type of slip can account for the size-frequency distribution.  Such a model does not 
require a lower limit to either earthquake or creep event size.  Rather it suggests that
 at Parkfield a transition from creep dominated slip to earthquake dominated slip
takes place in the range of moments equivalent to M~0.9 or so.  This is well above the 
M=0.3 detection limit of the seismic network, but right at the limit of current 
near-surface strain instruments.<P>

<B>A friction-feedback model for microearthquake sequences at Parkfield, California.</B><P>  

P. E. Malin , V. G. Oancea , and E. Shalev<P>

        Unique, high-sensitivity seismicity data from Parkfield, California, contain
 earthquake sequences that do not appear to fit simple models of either background or
 aftershock activity.  The data come from a stable downhole and surface seismographic
 network with a local complete-detection threshold of moment-magnitude M>0.3.  The
 sequences appear to migrate along the strike of the San Andreas fault with speeds 
between 10 and 100 km/yr.  They also appear to correlate with time-dependent 
changes in seismic wave travel times, crustal strain, and Ultra Low Frequency 
electromagnetic fields.  To account for the sequences, we propose a fault model 
involving the interaction of brittle and ductile slip, which we call a "friction feedback" 
system.  In this model, creep waves deep in the seismogenic part of the fault zone 
drive the migrating earthquake activity.  Using a simple mechanical analog, we have 
simulated the observed seismicity and the manner in which it transfers tectonic 
stress along the fault.  The results suggests that friction feedback plays an important
 role in the earthquake cycle, with slip along a fault segment alternately hanging up and surging ahead.

<B>The Relationship of Sierran Crustal Structure to the Amplitudes of Regional Seismic Waves from the NPE Explosion.</b><P>

A. Paul, D. Jongmans, M. Campillo, P. Malin, and D. Baumont. <P>


We have recorded and modeled the amplitudes of regional seismic waves produced by the Nevada Test Site NPE explosion along a 400 km profile across the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains of California.  Along this profile the amplitudes of the crustal phases Pg and Lg decrease monotonically with distance due to the cumulative effects of geometrical spreading and a frequency-dependent crustal attenuation given by Q = 120.  This observation implies that the average crust of the Sierras is no different to regional P or S waves than the average crusts of the adjacent Great Valley and Basin and Range.   In comparison with Pg, Pn amplitude increases across the Sierra Nevada and the eastern edge of the Great Valley.  Then, some 30 km west of the exposed Sierran batholith, Pn suddenly decreases by a factor of 10.  This change in Pn amplitude occurs close to a change in its apparent velocity.  Based on a new refraction model produced by the Southern Sierra Nevada Continental !
Dynamics study and numerical simulations of the Pn/Pg energy ratio, this decrease appears to be due to a local increase in crustal thickness from roughly 35 to 45 km centered in the western Sierra.  The size and location of the amplitude anomaly can be fitted with an otherwise gently-slopping, 2-layer model with average P velocities of 6.0 km/s and 8.0 km/s.  The small, offset, crustal root focuses Pn waves toward the westernmost Sierra Nevada/easternmost Great Valley, significantly reducing the Pn energy reaching the eastern Great Valley. The focusing effects diminish rapidly toward the west as the Moho flattens to its original slope. <P>

    <dd>Dr. Perkins came to Duke University in 1968 after
        spending 6 years as a Research Geologist with Shell
        Development company. He continues his association with
        industry through consulting activities and in the
        teaching of short courses primarily in the fields of
        carbonate facies analysis diagenesis. Dr. Perkins'
        current research interests are focused on the Pleistocene
        and Holocene carbonates of the Turks and Caicos Islands
        in the British West Indies and oil field analogs. He and
        his co- workers have recently described oolite deposition
        in settings far removed from the shelf margin where they
        are generally considered to form. His students have
        recently conducted studies on the mineralogy and pore
        water chemistry of schizohaline pond sediments on West
        Caicos and the evolution of a Holocene carbonate mound
        near the island of Providenciales. Studies by students on
        ancient carbonates are also encouraged to provide better
        integration between modern sediment studies and ancient
        analogs. More recently these studies have included
        projects on the Cambro-Ordovician Knox of the Southern
        Appalachians, and the Jurassic Smackover Limestone of the
        Gulf Coast.</dd>

    <dd>Bruce Corliss was on the staff of the Woods Hole
        Oceanographic Institution for six years before joining
        the Department of Geology in 1984. As a geological
        oceanographer, he is interested in Cenozoic
        paleoceanography and studies marine microfossils and
        deep-sea sediments. His early work dealt with the
        distribution of Quaternary deep-sea benthic foraminifera
        in the Southern Ocean and their relationship with present
        and past deep bottom water circulation patterns. Work
        related to these studies includes taxonomic, stable
        isotopic and phenotypic variation studies of the benthic
        foraminifera. This effort was followed by studies of
        Eocene-Oligocene paleoceanography based on the analysis
        of microfossils and sediments from Deep Sea Drilling
        Project samples. An ancillary aspect of his research has
        been in deep-sea sedimentation. A study of Cenozoic
        sedimentation in the Pacific was based on a synthesis of
        sedimentological, geochemical, and paleontological data
        from a red clay sequence. A second sedimentological study
        dealt with carbonate sedimentation beneath the Antarctic
        Circumpolar Current. Dr. Corliss' current research deals
        with the ecology of living deep-sea benthic foraminifera
        using data from box core samples taken on a number of
        oceanographic cruises in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic
        Oceans. The objectives of this work are to determine the
        environmental variables which are important controls on
        the foraminiferal distribution patterns, and to consider
        the functional morphology and stable isotopic composition
        of the foraminiferal test as well. The foraminifera have
        been used to demonstrate that seasonal differences exist
        in the deep-sea benthos, with benthic foraminifera
        exhibiting rapid growth similar to rates observed in
        shallow water. This observation suggests that it may be
        possible to reconstruct seasonal environmental conditions
        in certain areas of the oceans such as coastal upwelling
        regimes. Research is now underway to maintain and culture
        deep-sea taxa in the laboratory to test some of the
        observations made from the distribution studies. These
        studies will be useful in refining the use of benthic
        foraminifera in paleoceanography studies and will also
        provide information on biological processes in the deep
        sea.</dd>

<BODY><H2>Linkage of Southern Ocean Paleoproductivity and
  Terrigenous Input During the Eocene and
  Oligocene</H2>


<H3>Bruce Corliss and Qingmin Miao  (Department of Geology,
  Duke Univ., Durham, NC 27708; 919-684-2951;
  bcorliss@rogue.geo.duke.edu)</H3>

Productivity records have been established from ODP Sites 689B and 690B
from the Maud Rise in the Southern Ocean for the Eocene and Oligocene
intervals.  Productivity estimates are based on the accumulation rates of
calcium carbonate, organic carbon, opal and benthic foraminifera.
Productivity is high in the early Eocene and decreases in the middle
Eocene.  Productivity values are low in  the late Eocene and early
Oligocene, with generally high, but variable values in the late early
Oligocene and late Oligocene.  The lack of a productivity change at the
Eocene/Oligocene boundary suggests that productivity and climate change are
not linked during this interval when major climatic and thermohaline
circulation changes are thought to have occurred.

The accumulation rates of terrigenous material found at these sites are
quite similar to the productivity records, suggesting that Eocene-Oligocene
productivity in this area is related to terrigenous input.  Due to a lack
of ice-rafted debris in both sites during this interval, we suggest that
the terrigenous material was supplied to the Maud Rise by eolian transport
or by surface currents.  The similarity of productivity and terrigenous
records is consistent with the suggestion that terrigenous input is a
primary control on oceanic productivity in the modern ocean (the Iron
Hypothesis)  and raises the possibility that terrigenous input may
influence or control oceanic productivity levels over long intervals of
geological time.

His work is directed at quantifying how nutrient and hydrologic cycles control the chemistry of forest soils, drainage waters and forest productivity. His scientific interests in these topics are motivated by a desire to improve the management of soil-plant-watershed systems to support long-term human use.  The responses of poorly buffered soils are of most interest, most particularly extremely weathered, acidic Ultisols and Oxisols that are common and erodible to the forests of the humid temperate zone and tropics.  His research objectives are pursued both individually and cooperatively with scientists from several disciplines.  His primary educational objectives are to help students develop an understanding and an appreciation for ecological functions of soil and forest ecosystems through lectures, seminars, field trips, and indoor and outdoor laboratories.<P> <A HREF = "hydro.htm">To Center for Hydrologic Science.</A><P></B>

The Carolina Geological Society was founded in 1937 and incorporated in 1985. It is an exclusively charitable 
and educational organization and is fully tax exempt under 501 (c)(3) and 509 (a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
As stated in the Articles of Incorporation, the purpose of the Society is
<P>
<DL>
<UL>
<DD><LI>To promote the geosciences, especially within the states of North and South Carolina;
<P>


<DD><LI>To promote and encourage their study in the schools and colleges of these states;
<P>


<DD><LI>To encourage research in these sciences and the presentation of its results;
<P>


<DD><LI>To promote a spirit of friendship and cooperation among the earth scientists within the area named;
<P>


<DD><LI>To engage in any activities which in the opinion of its Board of Directors may be desirable, necessary or helpful in the promotion of the above listed purposes.
<P>
</UL>
</DL>
<B>
Historically the principal activity of the Society is an annual field trip and yearly membership meeting. The field 
trip is held in the fall during the month of October or November on a weekend. The membership meeting and banquet 
is held on Saturday night. The Saturday and  day Sunday field trip traditionally is led by one (or more) professional 
(or advanced graduate student) who has studied the detailed geology of the area.


Membership is open to anyone with a serious interest in the geosciences. Dues are currently $2.00 per year, but 
we request that you pay five years in advance.

The Society is governed by a seven member Board of Directors elected from the membership at the annual meeting. 
The Directors serve for one year except for the officers who remain as Directors for an additional year.

Members may request a copy of the charter and by-laws.

For the Society records, the Secretary requests, name, mailing address, work phone, home phone, email address 
(if any), and company of employment.

     Emission of dust from desert sources is a signal
of nonequilibrium surface change.  Dust generated by
wind erosion is thus one of many components of global
change.  Desert dust may be transported thousands of
kilometers before deposition, where it may become an
important part of the soil. The study of source
mechanisms of desert dust emissions is a component of
desertification science.  The study of desert dust
includes geological studies of the origin of dust
parent material, aerodynamic/micrometeorological
studies of source mechanisms, soil studies of
vulnerability to wind erosion, transport/synoptic-scale
meteorological studies, atmospheric electricity
associated with dust emission, remote sensing studies,
and modelling studies.  Since desert dust is emitted
from almost all continents, it is truly a
global/international problem.

In an effort to understand the dynamics of near-bottom flows and associated bottom changes in shallow coastal areas, three instrumented bipods were deployed on the shoreface at the CERC Field Research Facility (FRF) in depths of 5.5, 8 and 13 m. Each bipod was instrumented with three electromagnetic current meters at nominal elevations of 0.15, 0.60 and 1.35 m above the bed, a pressure sensor and an acoustic altimeter. The 13m site was also the location of a bottom mounted (upward looking) ADCP during several months in the fall of 1994, allowing monitoring of the interior and near surface currents.
During the first year of deployment, the FRF has felt the effects of a large extratropical `northeaster' on October 14-17, 1994 as well as two nearby hurricanes, Gordon from November 16-19, 1994 and Felix from August 15-18, 1995. Significant wave heights at the 13 m site exceeded 4 m during the northeaster and Hurricane Felix, and 6 m during Hurricane Gordon. Cross-shore mean flows were a maximum during Hurricane Gordon, when they exceeded 0.5 m s-1 (offshore) at the 13 m site. The mean cross-shore currents also exhibited significant, though crudely defined, cross-shore gradients. Vertical gradients, including at times reversals in flow direction, are seen in the ADCP data from the 13 m site.
This presentation will examine the measurements from these three storms in the context of models of wave-driven mean currents and discuss other processes which may help explain the departure of observations from those theoretical predictions.

It has been hypothesized that regional geologic constraints, including both bathymetry and sediment type, may modify coastal and nearshore processes.  This study investigates the specific hypothesis that Wimble Shoals, a consolidated Pleistocene submarine headland, acts as a major control on coastal fluid dynamics and shoreline orientation in the vicinity of Rodanthe, N.C.  Annual rates of shoreline recession in this area are as great as 5.2 m/year.  In order to test this hypothesis a weakly non-linear combined refraction and diffraction model (REF/DIF S Version 1.1) that simulates the behavior of a random sea over irregular bottom bathymetry was applied to a region (N 35 26' - 35 40' lat./ offshore to W 74 50' long., 36km x 36km) offshore of Rodanthe N.C.  Bathymetric measurements were digitized from NOAA charts 11555, 12204, and 12200.  Input wave statistics were generated from four years of data compiled from NOAA NDBC buoy 44014, a directional wave buoy located 88.3 km offshore of the North Carolina / Virginia border in 48 meters of water (36 34' lat./ 74 50' long.).  Five specific cases where chosen from this database and ground-truthed at the Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility in Duck, N.C.  REF/DIF S predictions of the longshore variability of nearshore wave height, direction, and radiation stresses were recorded for theses representative offshore wave climates.  Preliminary analysis of monochromatic model results reveal the Wimble Shoals submarine headland to dramatically govern the distribution of nearshore wave height and direction.  The ultimate goal is to identify longshore gradients of momentum flux to be consistent with annual rates of shoreline recession.

Bar trapped edge waves are evident in data collected during the Delilah experiment, at Duck, N.C. Oct, 1990. It has been shown theoretically that edge waves are effectively trapped on bars when the phase speed approaches , where the depth, hbar, can be modified by current according to Howd et al., 1992. All particular combinations of frequency and wavenumber that correspond to a phase speed approaching , have edge wave amplitudes that are larger over the bar than at the shoreline. This bar trapping occurs frequently in data collected during the Delilah experiment. The effect is most clearly shown in s-k spectral plots of the alongshore component of the orbital velocity from two alongshore arrays, one in the trough, and one seaward of the bar. The degree and predominant direction of edge wave bar trapping correlates with incident wave forcing conditions; it appears that a combination of particular incident wave height, bimodality, direction and frequency conditions is necessary for trapping to be optimal. As expected, the slope of  line, that is the effective depth of the bar as inferred from the field data, changes with longshore current and tide, but the slope also appears to be function of the linearity of the alongshore bar. The proportion of energy collected along the  line in s-k spectral plots, is greater at high tide than at low tide.  These preliminary observations show that concentrations of energy along the  region of the s-k diagram occur at some frequency ranges almost all of the time during Delilah; the incident wave forcing conditions appear to control the bandwidth of these bar trapping ranges, their strength, their frequency and their direction of propagation.

It has been hypothesized that regional geologic constraints, including both bathymetry and sediment type, may modify coastal and nearshore processes.  This study investigates the specific hypothesis that Wimble Shoals, a consolidated Pleistocene submarine headland, acts as a major control on coastal fluid dynamics and shoreline orientation in the vicinity of Rodanthe, NC.  Annual rates of shoreline recession in this area are as great as 5.2 m/year.  In order to test this hypothesis a weakly non-linear wave refraction/diffraction model (REFDIF 1 Version 2.5) that includes the effects of wave shoaling and energy dissipation was applied to a region (N 35 26' - 35 40' lat./ offshore to W 74 50' long., ~ 40km x 30km) offshore of Rodanthe NC.  Bathymetric measurements were digitized from NOAA charts 11555, 12204, and 12200.  Input wave statistics were generated from four years of data compiled from NOAA NDBC buoy 44014, a directional wave buoy located 88.3 km offshore of the North Carolina / Virginia border in 48 meters of water (36 34' lat./ 74 50' long.), and ground-truthed at the Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility in Duck, NC.  REFDIF 1 predictions of the alongshore variability of nearshore wave height and direction were recorded for representative offshore wave climates.  The Wimble Shoals submarine headland was found to dramatically govern the distribution of wave heights in the nearshore.  Wave height estimates prior to breaking were found to vary by a factor of two over longshore distances as short as 2 km.  Estimates of wave direction prior to breaking deviate from the initial deep water angle of incidence by +/- 20o.  Longshore gradients in both wave height and direction will result in gradients of longshore currents (and thus presumably sediment transport).  In this specific case the influence of antecedent geologic constraints upon modern nearshore coastal processes is dominant.  Scientific understanding of regional shoreface processes must incorporate the specific geologic setting rather than make broad assumptions of shoreface characteristics.

Two instrumented bipods deployed in depths of 5.5 and 13 m on the shoreface at Duck, NC since October, 1994 have recorded waves, currents, and bed elevation changes during two major storms - a northeaster and Hurricane Gordon.  The instrumentation on each bipod (3 electromagnetic current meters, a pressure sensor, and an acoustic altimeter) is supplemented by an upward looking ADCP at 13 m depth which further allows us to sample the interior and near surface currents in the overlying water column.	
Combined with wind field data for two storms during the fall of 1994, we have determined that both wind- and wave-driven current flows are responsible for erosional and depositional changes on the shoreface.  In depths up to 13 m, we have documented bed elevation changes in excess of 30 cm.  This magnitude of bed elevation change exceeds previously held ideas of "closure" of the shoreface beyond the surf zone.  This area of the inner shelf is a dynamic system with previously undocumented periods of recovery from such large events.	Continued deployment and maintenance of these instrumented bipods for the next few years will allow us to establish a longer term climatology for this shoreface where past deployments have only lasted weeks at most.  While interannual variability of the shoreface at Duck, NC has been tied to storm events by biweekly profiling with the CRAB (Coastal Research Amphibious Buggy), continued monitoring of the shoreface at depths beyond the capacity of the CRAB will extend our understanding of the response of this shoreline to storms.

<P><B>Tertiary Faulting Associated With Dike Intrusion and Flexure on the
East Greenland Volcanic Rifted Margin </B></P>

<P>J A Karson (Dept. of Geology, Duke Univ., Durham, NC 27708; 919-684-2731;
jkarson@geo.duke.edu)</P>

<P>C K Brooks, K Hangh j and T F D Nielsen (All at: Danish Lithosphere
Center, ster Voldgade 10, 1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; 45-33 11 88 66; kentb@geo.geol.ku.dk)</P>

<P>The East Greenland coastal dike swarm and associated flexure is a uniquely
well exposed section of a rifted continental margin that formed in a hot-spot
environment in early Tertiary time. The coastline trends at a low angle
to the boundary between the ocean/ continent boundary providing a cross
section of the rifted crust. Considerable magmatic extension over a region
at least 20 km wide has been accommodated by intense dike intrusion, reaching
100% in places. However, recent field work has demonstrated that mechanical
extension in the form of a kinematically linked system of faults may have
accommodated at least as much extension. The rotation of domino-style fault
blocks bounded by northwest (inland)-dipping normal faults and subvertical
northwest-striking transfer and transform faults have rotated early dikes
to dips as little as 30 to the west (inland). Precambrian basement rocks
and Tertiary dikes are cut by extensive zones of mylonite to cataclasite
and by abundant pseudotachylite veins. Faulting and greenschist facies
metamorphism resulted in pervasive shearing and alteration of the early
dikes. Progressively less deformation and meta-morphism are recorded in
later generations of dikes, the latest of which are sub-vertical and almost
undeformed. This style of upper crustal extension is thought to be accommodated
at depth by limited ductile deformation and the intrusion of elongate gabbroic
plutons, some of which are exposed along the coast at the present level
of erosion. These results were obtained along strike from a submerged part
of the margin that was drilled on ODP Leg 152, providing a possible window
into the middle crust beneath the drill sites. </P>

<P><B>Cenozoic Detachment Faulting in the Turkana Rift, Kenya </B></P>

<P>J A Karson, S D Hurst and D G Jarvis (All at: Department of Geology,
Duke University, Durham, NC 27706; 919-684-5847)</P>

<P>In the Turkana Rift, half-graben with as much as 7 km of Oligocene-Miocene
sediment fill are bounded by border faults that dip as gently as 20 . Hanging
wall and footwall structures indicate that slip took place on this low-angle
surface. The hanging wall consists of nearly flat-lying Miocene sedimentary
rocks and lavas. Sedimentary material is chaotically deformed near the
fault zone resulting in a melange of blocks of both hanging wall sedimentary
units as well as blocks of footwall basement gneiss in a red to maroon
sandy matirx. The footwall rocks are dominantly Proterozoic migmatites
composed of foliated amphibolites cut by granitic sheets and veins. Regional
structural trends in the basement strike at a high angle to the Cenozoic
border faults. Within about 6-8 km of the border faults, the gneissic fabrics
and local locally developed mylonites are cut by steeply dipping normal
and strike slip faults. Low-angle, conjugate, retrograde shear zones with
normal slip are common. These shear zones have distinctive phaccoidal mescopic
fabrics and ramp-flat geometries controlled by the layering of the gneisses.
Where overlying sedimentary units are preserved, low-angle normal faults
cut-out parts of the lower section. Locally, the low-angle shear zones
cut and displace near-vertical Tertiary diabase dikes. The low-angle shear
zones are cut by closely spaced, steeply dipping joints and small normal
faults within 1 km of the border faults. The border faults have dips of
20 -50 and are marked by highly silicified fault breccias with common pseudotachylite
veins. The orientations of dikes, gently dipping lavas and sedimentary
rocks locally preserved in the footwall suggest that the shear zones and
border faults slipped in approximately their present orientations.</P>

<P>The low-angle shear zones exposed in the footwalls of the major border
faults suggest an episode of Cenozoic crustal stretching that can help
account for the disparity between the horizontal extension manifest in
the more obvious steep faults, only about 20%, and the large amount of
subsidence in the adjacent basins. In addition, it appears that low-angle
faults and shear zones slipped in very gently dipping attitudes even during
relatively small amounts of regional extension. These data have important
implications for the evolution of stuctures in highly extended terranes
and for the interpretation of areas with relatively small amounts of extension
such as mid-ocean ridges and rifts on other planetary bodies.</P>

<P><B>Upper Mantle and Lower Crustal Processes at Slow-Spreading Ridges:
New Insights From Serpentinites and Gabbroic Rocks Drilled on ODP Leg 153
in the MARK Area (MAR at 23 N)</B></P>

<P>J A Karson (Dept. of Geology, Duke Univ., Durham, NC 27708; 919-684-2731;
jkarson@geo.duke.edu)</P>

<P>M Cannat (Laboratoire de Petrologie, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie,
Paris, France), D J Miller (ODP, 1000 Discovery Drive, College Station,
TX 77845) and ODP Leg 153 Shipboard Party</P>

<P>Drilling on ODP Leg 153 recovered serpentinized peridotites and gabbroic
rocks on the western median valley wall of the MARK Area (MAR at 23 N).
Ongoing investigations provide new insights into the processes that create
and modify the oceanic lithosphere in this slow- spreading environment.
The cores substantially augment information from samples collected with
submersibles in the same area and provide constraints on the vertical dimensions
of various features. Together, the drilling and submersible data provide
an unprecedented 3-dimensional char-acterization of bodies of deep crustal
and upper mantle rocks that were exhumed by faulting on the walls of the
MAR.</P>

<P>Previous studies at the drill sites mapped extensive low-angle normal
faults with widely developed gently east-dipping fabrics. The fabrics were
found to persist to at least 200 m depth in the serpentinites. Deformation
fabrics in the gabbro sites are much more hetrogeneous and variable, probably
reflecting complex footwall strain. The cores also reveal lithologic heterogeneity
that is not apparent in the sub- mersible samples. Variably deformed and
metamorphosed mafic intrusive rock units were found in the serpentinites.
These include syntectonic melt veins, intervals of transitional granulite
to amphi- bolite facies metagabbros with tectonic contacts, and nearly
unmeta- morphosed diabase dikes. The gabbroic rocks, dominantly gabbros
and olivine gabbros, are very heterogeneous and display diverse igneous
cumulate textures and layering that vary in style and orien- tation over
tens of centimeters. Igneous textures are locally over- printed by widely
developed magmatic and crystal-plastic deformation fabrics, discrete amphibolite
facies shear zones, and greenschist facies cataclastic fault zones and
veins. Retrograde effects are very subdued compared to the submersible
samples. Paleomagnetic results reveal intimately mixed normal and reverse
polarity material in cores spread over 2 km parallel to the MAR axis and
also in a core nearly 2 km closer to the axis.</P>

<P>These results suggest heterogeneous intrusion of mafic material into
both the lower crust and upper mantle as they were uplifted, cooled and
hydrated. Strain and metamorphism appear to have progressed more or less
continuously from magmatic and granulite facies to sub- greenschist facies
conditions rather than episodically.</P>

<P><B>Internal Structure of Oceanic Crust</B></P>

<P>Jeffrey A. Karson, Department of Geology, Duke University, Durham NC
27708-0230 jkarson@geo.duke.edu</P>

<P>This talk will provide an overview of the present view of the 3-dimensional
internal structure of the oceanic crust. Constraints on this structure
come from two different perspectives: studies of contemporary oceanic lithosphere
and investigations of ophiolites. Both of these perspectives have significant
limitations and ambiguities, however, the cross pollination of ideas stemming
from observations in these two domains has provided a new view of the range
of variations of oceanic crustal structure and the processes responsible
for different crustal structures. The current view departs, sometimes wildly,
from the 1970's view of oceanic crust as a relatively simple, laterally
continuous, stratiform assemblage of surficial basaltic lavas underlain
successively by a sheeted diabase dike complex, a thick assemblage of isotropic
to layered gabbros and ultramafic rocks, and upper mantle peridotites.
Whereas spreading axes were previously viewed as relatively simple graben
structures, it is now clear that a very wide range of structures ranging
from simple graben and half-graben to oceanic core complexes with complex
linked fault systems occur. Although spreading centers are commonly considered
to be dominated by horizontal extension, large-scale vertical mass transport
is required to build both the upper and lower crust. </P>

<P>Over the past two decades, very significant progress has been made at
documenting newly discovered complexities of oceanic crustal structure.
Thanks to the development of new analytical techniques, for example U-series
radiometric dating, important new constraints can be placed on tectonic
processes at spreading centers. However, some new &quot;tools&quot; are
required to fully quantify mechanical, magmatic, and hydrothermal processes
in different structural settings. </P>

<P><B>Fault Structure of a Ridge-Segment Scale Half Graben on the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge </B></P>

<P>J.A. Karson, S.D. Hurst, R.M. Lawrence and SMARK'95 Cruise Participants
Department of Geology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708</P>

<P>Detailed geological investigations utilizing Alvin and deep-towed cameras
in the SMARK Area (22 30'N), about 100 km S of the Kane Transform, provide
new constraints on the details of fault structures in this typical asymmetrical
rift segment. A block-faulted monoclinal flexure bounds the W side of the
median valley whereas the higher E median valley wall is a moderately W-dipping
(~30 ) normal fault zone exposing cataclastic basaltic and diabasic rocks.
Structural measurements and paleomagnetic data from oriented samples of
dikes and lava flows suggest a complex pattern of tilt domains separated
by minor transfer faults. The footwall of this fault zone may represent
a juvenile stage in the growth of an &quot;oceanic core complex&quot;.</P>

<P><B>LARGE-SCALE FAULTING AND MAGMATIC CONSTRUCTION AT VOLCANIC RIFTS
AND CONTINENTAL MARGINS: EXAMPLES FROM EAST AFRICA AND EAST GREENLAND</B></P>

<P>KARSON, Jeffrey A., Department of Geology, Duke University, Durham,
NC 27708-0230.</P>

<P>Volcanic rifts and continental margins reveal the interplay of magmatism
and faulting during continental break-up and the inception of seafloor
spreading. Rifting in these environments occurs near hot spots in cratonic
crust with elevated topography and geothermal gradients. About half of
the Earth's continental margins formed in this way.</P>

<P>Tertiary extension and magmatism in the E. Branch of the E. African
Rift began at ~60 Ma and continues to the present. The rift occurs near
the crest of regional domal uplifts above hot spots and ranges from 50
to 150 km wide. The earliest magmatism was very widespread and became more
localized with time. Diabase dike swarms and minor plutons intruded shallow
crustal levels and larger mafic to intermediate plutonic bodies are likely
to have been emplaced at depth. Normal faults, including major low-angle
detachments controlled subsidence, drainage patterns, depocenters, and
tilt-block domains. Linked arrays of half-graben evolved in the hanging
walls of the detachments.</P>

<P>Rifting on the Tertiary E. Greenland margin occurred near the Iceland
hot spot at ~55 Ma. Landward-dipping detachment systems controlled the
development of crustal-scale hanging wall roll-overs that accommodated
the subsidence and growth of giant wedges of seaward-thickening basaltic
rocks. Dikes increase in density seaward and locally form sheeted dike
complexes. Synkinematic plutons intrude shallow crustal levels near the
base of the volcanic units; denser plutons underplate the crust. The transition
from cratonic to &gt;90% basaltic crust is only a few tens of kilometers
wide. In these examples, magmatic construction and faulting both accommodate
horizontal extension of pre-existing cratonic crust and compete to determine
the crustal thickness. The cratonic crust, as well as pre- to syn-kinematic
igneous rocks, are thinned by faulting and associated deeper level ductile
flow. The overall crustal thickness is increased by magmatic construction;
however, underplated material may obscure the thickness of the stretched
cratonic crust.</P>

<P><B>Mechanical Extension of the Median Valley Floor along the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge in the MARK Area</B></P>

<P>W. H. Wheeler and J.A. Karson (both at: Department of Geology, Duke
University, Durham, NC 27708; 919-681-8165; e-mail: quad@geo.duke.edu)</P>

<P>The slow spreading of the seafloor along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is accomplished
by a combination of magmatism and mechanical extension within the median
valley, and mechanical extension along and outside of the median valley
walls. In this study, we quantify the mechanical extension component affecting
the median-valley floor of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from 22 50' to 23 30'
N Latitude, immediately south of the Kane Fracture Zone (MARK area). Extension
is calculated along flowline-parallel transects by summing the heaves of
faults imaged in Sea MARC I side-looking sonar data. Data from bathymetric
surveys, Deep-Tow side-looking sonar, manned submersible dives and camera
tows have also been incorporated.</P>

<P>Mechanical extension of the median valley floor is relatively low, ranging
from 4 to 17%. Coverage and resolution limitations, as well as recent volcanic
construction, render these values minima. In the southern part of the study
area, where the median valley has a full-graben-like morphology, mechanical
extension is highest (10%-17%). Mechanical extension is lowest (&lt;9%)
in the half-graben-like section to the north, adjacent to the Kane Fracture
Zone, and also decreases toward an adjacent half-graben-like section to
the south of the study area. Local along-axis variation of mechanical extension
does not appear to correlate to volcanic construction. However, significant
along-axis variation over as little as 5 km suggests the presence of transfer
or accommodation zones, especially at the transition from the full- to
the half-graben-like median valley morphologies. These along-axis relations
indicate that extension along the median valley walls, and/or perhaps magmatism,
make a greater contribution to overall lithospheric extension where half-graben-like
morphologies occur.</P>

CONTINENTAL MARGINS, AND SPREADING CENTERS</B> </P>

<P>Volcanic rifts and continental margins reveal the interplay of magmatism
and faulting during continental break-up and the inception of seafloor
spreading. Continental rifting in these environments occurs near hot spots
in cratonic crust with elevated topography and geothermal gradients. About
half of the Earth's continental margins appear to have formed in this way
and examples of ancient margins of this type are preserved in some mountain
belts. Spreading centers that initiate at these types of margins may develop
various morphologies depending upon the magma supply relative to plate
separation rates. The present-day geology of volcanic rifts, continental
margins, and spreading centers provides a possible way of viewing the evolution
of divergent plate boundaries.</P>

<P>Tertiary extension and magmatism in the Eastern Branch of the East African
Rift began at ~60 Ma and continues to the present. The rift occurs near
the crest of regional domal uplifts above hot spots and ranges from 50
to 150 km wide. The earliest magmatism was very widespread and became more
localized with time. Diabase dike swarms and minor plutons intruded shallow
crustal levels and larger mafic to intermediate plutonic bodies are likely
to have been emplaced at depth. Normal faults, including major low-angle
detachments controlled subsidence, drainage patterns, depocenters, and
tilt-block domains. Linked arrays of half-graben evolved in the hanging
walls of the detachments.</P>

<P>Rifting on the Tertiary E. Greenland margin occurred near the Iceland
hot spot at ~55 Ma. Landward-dipping detachment systems controlled the
development of crustal-scale hanging wall roll-overs that accommodated
the subsidence and growth of giant wedges of seaward-thickening basaltic
rocks. Dikes increase in density seaward and locally form sheeted dike
complexes. Synkinematic plutons intrude shallow crustal levels near the
base of the volcanic units; denser plutons underplate the crust. The transition
from cratonic to &gt;90% basaltic crust occurs over a lateral distance
of only a few tens of kilometers.</P>

<P>Large variations in magmatic and mechanical processes occur along the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis despite a roughly uniform spreading rate (~20 mm/year).
Spreading centers near hot spots, like the Reykjanes Ridge produce relatively
thick oceanic crust by axial accretion characterized by a high magma budget
and only minor faulting. As a spreading center moves laterally away from
rifted continental margins, the magma budget may change. If the magma budget
is very low on the time scale of 105 years, plate separation will be accommodated
primarily by mechanical extension and extreme crustal stretching and core
complex structures may develop exposing lower crustal and even upper mantle
rocks as seen in the MARK Area.</P>

<P>In these examples, magmatic construction and faulting both accommodate
horizontal extension of pre-existing cratonic or oceanic crust and compete
to determine the crustal thickness. The crustal units, as well as pre-
to syn-kinematic igneous rocks, are thinned by faulting and associated
deeper level ductile flow. The overall crustal thickness is increased by
magmatic construction and underplated materials may obscure the thickness
of the stretched crust. In both oceanic an continental examples, rifts
are segmented along-strike, with magmatic and mechanical processes varying
between, and to a lesser extent within, adjacent segments.</P>

<P><B>Side-scan sonar mapping of the seafloor geology at the eastern Ridge-Transform
Intersection in the MARK area (23&deg;40'N): Implications for the tectonic
processes on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at Kane Transform</B> </P>

<P>J A Karson, D Gao, S D Hurst (Department of Geology, Duke University,
Durham NC 27708-0230) J R Delaney (School of Oceanography, University of
Washington, 98195) and F N Spiess (Scripps Institute of Oceanography, La
Jolla, CA 92093)</P?

<P> In 1992, a large acoustic data set was obtained
using Scripp's Deep-Tow side-scan (up/down-looking) sonar system on the
Tow-The-MARK cruise at the eastern intersection between the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge and the Kane Transform (MARK area). An acoustic image mosaic covering
a total area of 600 square km has been merged with both the SeaBeam bathymetry
and ground geological data obtained from previous near-bottom investigations.
The resulting geologic map reveals several important features that were
either poorly documented or not recognized in previous investigations.
Sampling and observations from submersibles and towed cameras conffirms
that different side-scan backscatter patterns are attributable to distinctive
basement rock units, surficial deposits, and tectonic features. and are
spatially associated with various morphotectonic elements. The rift valley
floor is covered by extensive areas with a hummocky backscatter pattern
which is associated with pillow lavas and a multitude of near-circular
volcanic edifices. The hummocky texture of the neovolcanic edifices east
of the nodal basin contrasts with the smooth texture of the older volcanic
edifices west of the nodal basin. The western rift valley wall (inside
corner) is characterized by a &quot;checkerboard&quot; backscatter pattern
corresponding to gabbroic outcrops. Distinctive arcuate reflectors indicate
large-scale debris slides. The acoustically defined boundary between the
hummocky and checkboard backscatter patterns at the foot of the west rift
valley wall is interpreted as the contact between pillow lavas and gabbros.
This contact may be a major detachment fault between lower crustal rocks
of the west rift valley wall (footwall) and overlying allochthonous upper
crustal rocks of the rift valley floor (hanging wall). Alternatively, the
contact may be an unconformity between relatively old, faulted gabbroic
rocks and younger basaltic lavas. The transform valley is characterized
by both transform-parallel and northwest-trending transform-oblique lineaments,
with increasing obliquity toward the ridge-transform intersection. The
southern transform valley wall is characterized by the relatively weak
backscatter intensity as compared with the rift valley floor and west rift
valley wall, which is attributable to relatively thick surficial sediments.
A large-scale, tongue-shaped reflector outlines a 9 square km debris slide
on the south tranform valley wall. Northwest-trending lineaments are truncated
by northeast-trending lineaments and may be extensional and transfer faults,
respectively. These integrated observations document new complexities of
the tectonics of the ridge-transfrom intersections.</P>

<P>In 1992, approximately 4 gigabytes of side-scan sonar data were collected
on the Tow-The-MARK cruise to the eastern intersection of the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge and the Kane Transform. In this study, we attempt to quantify the
interpretation of side-scan sonar data based on the texture of side-scan
sonar images using the GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) method and
Fourier fractal analysis. The texture analysis yielded six multispectral
feature components at lower resolution from the original monospectral digital
image. Using these six feature components, we performed a principal components
analysis to maximize the differences between calculated textures. Selections
of three of the six components can be the visually displayed using RGB
color primaries to make a false-color image composite, which highlights
features that are not discernible in the original 6-dimensional feature
space. Based on these principal components, the original side-scan sonar
image can be automatically classified into several arbitrary categories
through clustering, or into geologically meaningful units through supervised
classification. Supervised classification calibrates the principal components
of the feature vector to the ground-truth geologic data and extrapolates
geologic observations to unexplored regions based on their similarity of
texture features. To implement these procedures electronically, we developed
a set of &quot;plug-in&quot; image filter modules for a commercial image
processing software package. These modules extract multispectral feature
vectors from the original monospectral digital image via the GLCM and fractal
analysis, transform these feature values into principal components by a
linear operation of original feature vector and eigenvectors, and automatically
classify the image using clustering and/or supervised classification techniques.
As a result, we produced a series of thematic texture maps in which pillow
basalt terrane, gabbroic outcrops, and surficial deposits can be distinguished
and mapped using different colors. These computer-generated thematic maps
provide the basis of automating the tedious process of translating side-scan
sonar images into a geologic map.</P>

<P><B>Upper Crustal Construction and Faulting at a Segment-Scale Half Graben
on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 22 30'N (SMARK Area)</B></P>

<P>The morphological, geological, and geophysical expression of ridge segments
is highly variable along the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Segments
that are symmetrical and asymmetrical in cross section are both common.
Detailed geological investigations utilizing Alvin and deep-towed cameras
in the SMARK Area (22 30'N), about 100 km south of the Kane Transform,
provide new constraints on the details of faulting and magmatism at a typical
asymmetrical rift segment. Previous studies (Toomey et al., 1985,1988)
documented seismicity in the middle crust to upper mantle of the median
valley and adjacent eastern median valley wall. Seismic and gravity constraints
indicate a normal crustal thickness (Morris and Detrick, 1991).</P>

<P>The median valley floor is mostly &gt;4000 m depth and is characterized
by hummocky terrain with isolated conical peaks. Most of this area is covered
with variably faulted, fissured, and degraded basaltic pillow lavas with
variable thickness of accumulated pelagic ooze. Although fresh-looking
basaltic material is present locally, there is no clearly defined neovolcanic
zone. A block-faulted monoclinal flexure floored by basaltic pillow lavas
bounds the west side of the median valley; whereas, the higher, steeper
eastern median valley wall is a faulted exposure of greenschist facies
metadiabase overlain by relatively fresh basaltic pillow lavas and minor
flows. The upper crustal section exposed along the eastern wall is approximately
1.5 km thick and includes extensive outcrops of massive diabase as well
as discrete diabase dikes with highly variable orientations. Extensive
exposures of fault dip-slopes and cataclastic fault zones dip 25 -45 W.
Paleomagnetic data indicate that the dikes and faults have not been tectonically
rotated suggesting a more or less intact upper crustal structure.</P>

<P>The SMARK segment is interpreted as a segment-scale half-graben structure
similar to those of many continental rifts. Although constraints on the
age of basaltic rocks in the median valley floor are lacking, it appears
that the recent history of this segment has been dominated by crustal-scale
mechanical extension with little or no volcanism. This style of spreading
may be typical of deep, asymmetrical segments along slow-spreading ridges.</P>

<P>Photogeology based on 203 km of deep-towed camera tracklines document
the nature of the median valley floor of an asymmetrical ridge segment
in the southern part of the MARK Area. The 45 km long valley is bounded
by a high (&gt;2000 m total relief), steep (~45 ), kinked (at 22 36'N)
eastern median valley wall (EMVW), and a stepped en-echelon western margin.
The valley floor, predominantly deeper than 4000 mbsl, is broader in the
north (~15 km) than in the south (~7 km); it is narrowest (~6 km) in the
region of the bend in the EMVW (at 22 36'N). SeaBeam/SIMRAD bathymetry
shows conical hills (100-200 m bathymetric relief) and depressions (200
m deep, primarily along the base of the EMVW). The surface geology is dominated
by basaltic pillow lava and mixed basaltic talus and pillow lava (&lt;1
m diameter); sediment thickness ranges from &lt;0.5 m (~20% sediment cover)
to 1 m (100% sediment cover). The broader northern valley floor has highly
fissured constructional lavas with &lt;0.5-1 m sediment thickness. Near
the EMVW bend, sediment cover is generally thicker (0.7-1 m) over mixed
lava and talus, with an isolated region of talus with very little sediment
accumulation (&lt;0.5 m) near the base of the EMVW. The southern valley
floor is dominated by talus with 0.2-1 m sediment, and appears to be less
fissured than the northern area. Overall, volcanic constructional and tectonic
features are not systematically distributed relative to each other, or
relative to the bathymetric conical hills and depressions. However, an
elongate central band 1-2 km wide of relatively young-looking, less sedimented
(0.2-0.5 m) seafloor appears to be continuous along the full length of
the segment and is narrowest near the bend in the EMVW. This band is dominantly
fissured lavas in the north and talus deposits in the south, with a transitional
zone around the EMVW bend. Although absolute and relative ages of basaltic
units are only loosely constrained by finite sediment accumulation, it
appears that there is no well-defined neovolcanic zone in this segment.</P>

<P><B>Time/Space Variations in Seafloor Spreading in the MARK Area: The
Past 1 M.Y. of Crustal Accretion Along 100 km of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge</B></P>

<P>Introduction. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) between 22 and 24 N has been
the subject of comprehensive geological and geophysical investigations
by many investigators over the past 15 years. Data available from this
area provide unique insights into the processes attending crustal accretion
at slow spreading rates with low or variable magma budget.</P>

<P>Significant variations in the morphology and geology of the rift valley
occur along this 100 km interval of the MAR. Three very distinct spreading
segments are identified on the basis of morphology, seismic properties
of the median valley crust, magnetic anomaly patterns, gravity anomaly
patterns, and surface geology. In addition, the geology of individual segments
suggests temporal variations in faulting and magmatic construction. The
history of seafloor spreading in each segment during the past 1 m.y. is
reflected in the geology across the median valley which, at about 30 km
width, formed during this time interval (2.7 cm/yr.-full rate). Temporal
and spatial geological diversity in the MARK Area has important implications
for variations in the internal structure and composition of oceanic crust
produced in this type of spreading regime.</P>

<P>Northern Segment. The northern segment extends from the Kane Ridge-Transform
Intersection (RTI) south for about 35 km. It is characterized by highly
asymmetrical cross sectional morphology and geology with a much higher,
steeper, and geologically complex western wall. The western wall is dominated
by widespread exposures of variably deformed and metamorphosed gabbroic
rocks and serpentinites. ODP drilling suggests that the northern part of
this terrane is a collage of syn- to post-kinematic mafic plutons. To the
south, serpentinites with minor gabbroic intrusions and diabase dikes crop
out. Microstructures and fluid inclusions in the metagabbros indicate high-temperature
(amphibolite facies and higher) deformation beneath the floor of the median
valley. Retrograde (greenschist facies and lower) normal-slip shear zones
and faults (30 -50 dip to ENE) cut the gabbros and metagabbros. The gabbroic
exposures (middle to lower crustal rocks) are inferred to have been stripped
of about 2 km of previously overlying basaltic material and uplifted about
4 km from where they initially formed beneath the median valley floor.
It is not known if the serpentinites (hydrated upper mantle rocks) were
ever overlain by mafic crustal rocks. Both the metagabbro and serpentinite
exposures are capped by fractured basaltic pillow lavas without an intervening
sheeted dike complex. In contrast to this highly extended terrane, the
eastern median valley wall is deeper, less steep, and consists of only
block-faulted pillow basalts. Thus, this segment has experienced a large
amount of highly asymmetrical tectonic extension (&gt;100%), crustal thinning,
and uplift over the course of the last 1 m.y. and can be regarded as an
&quot;oceanic core complex&quot;.</P>

<P>Paradoxically, the northern segment appears to be the most volcanically
active region of the MARK Area. A median neovolcanic ridge (400 m x 4 km
x 40 km) runs the length of the segment but, was constructed only about
5000 years ago. The active Snake Pit Black Smoker Hydrothermal Vents are
situated at the top of this ridge. Magmatism in this segment therefore
appears to have been episodic and possibly discontinuous over the past
1.0 m.y.</P>

<P>Central Segment. The central segment lies in the interval from 50-80
km south of the Kane RTI where the median valley shallows to a regional-minimum
depth of about ~3000 m. The Central Segment is very symmetrical in cross
section and only pillow lavas crop out on both the eastern and western
median valley walls. Integrating offsets across steep fault scarps yields
an estimate of about 10-15% horizontal extension. Volcanism in this area
is subdued compared to the northern segment. Numerous isolated volcanoes
define axis-parallel and axis-perpendicular lineaments that intersect near
the center of this segment at Serocki Volcano (ODP Hole 648). Fresh, glassy,
sediment-free basalts occur in small, widely spaced patches and there is
no obvious neovolcanic zone. Thus, this segment appears to have been less
volcanically active than the northern segment during the last few thousand
years. Nevertheless, the lack of plutonic rock exposures indicates that
on the time-scale of the past million years, magmatism has been sufficient
to nearly keep pace with tectonic extension.</P>

<P>Southern Segment. The third segment south of the Kane RTI is centered
near 22 40'N, about 100 km south of the transform. The eastern median valley
wall is a continuous steep escarpment exposing a 1.5 km-thick section of
faulted basaltic and diabasic rocks. Relatively fresh basaltic pillow lavas
at the top of the wall are underlain by pillow lavas cut by variably tilted
diabase dikes and sills. No sheeted dike complex is evident and the lavas
and dikes pass downward into massive diabase with extensively developed
cataclastic fabrics and greenschist facies metamorphic assemblages. Gently
to moderately dipping normal fault surfaces are cut by steep faults that
create a stair-step morphology. A right-stepping jog in the wall is interpreted
as an intra-segment transfer fault.</P>

<P>The western median valley floor is a series of right-stepping fault
scarps cutting pillow lavas. Locally, young-looking lavas are sourced even
farther to the west. The median valley floor is mostly covered by basaltic
talus and relatively thick (&gt;0.5 m) pelagic sediment. Only locally do
conical hills and areas of low relief have relatively fresh, glassy pillow
lavas. In this area, teleseismic events occur in the crust and mantle beneath
the median valley and microseismic events define a west-dipping active
fault zone that intersects the surface in the eastern median valley wall.
The distribution of seismic activity in this area implies that asymmetrical
faulting is taking place in this relatively &quot;cold&quot; segment. This
type of deformation may represent an early stage of core-complex development
as seen in the northern segment.</P>

<P>Segment Boundary Zones. The three spreading segments described above
are separated by poorly defined segment boundary zones. In the MARK Area,
variations in structural geometry of adjacent segments requires that these
regions contain oblique-slip or strike-slip fault zones that permit different
styles and/or rates of tectonic extension in adjacent segments. These are
similar to &quot;accommodation zones&quot; of continental rifts with the
additional complication of magmatic dilation. In the MARK Area, these types
of structures are a kinematic requirement of the along-strike (north to
south) changes between segments with an east-dipping detachment fault to
one with symmetrical high-angle normal faulting to one with a west-dipping
detachment fault.</P>

<P>Gently dipping seismic reflectors in the sub-axial crust suggest that
some accommodation zones are essentially lateral ramps at the terminations
of major crustal detachments whereas others may be steep fault zones.</P>

<P>Implications. Thus, the style of extension, the magnitude of extension
of the axial lithosphere, and the role of magmatic construction relative
to faulting are all somewhat different from segment to segment in this
area. Future work is required to determine if this type of along-axis variation
is typical of slow-spreading ridges and if these types of variations persist
for periods greater than 1 m.y. The type of spreading that occurs in the
MARK Area cannot produce the laterally continuous rock units commonly portrayed
in oceanic crust and some ophiolite complexes. Instead, we would expect
a highly heterogeneous and discontinuous assemblage of rock units that
vary over 0-10 kilometers both parallel and perpendicular to seafloor spreading
flow lines.</P>

<P><B>Geometry and Kinematics of Faulting on the Tertiary East Greenland
Volcanic Rifted Margin</B></P>

<P>Investigations along ~250 km of the East Greenland coast and off-shore
by the Ocean Drilling Program provide insights into faulting of a Volcanic
Rifted Margin (VRM) during break-up. Cross-cutting relations with Tertiary
dike swarms, lavas, and sedimentary units indicate 3 phases of faulting:
1) Coast-parallel normal faults are associated with the development of
a series of fault-bounded basins filled by Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary
clastic sediments and lavas; large-scale normal faults cutting basement
but cut by dike swarms are probably of the same generation. 2) Landward-
and seaward-dipping normal faults developed during the intrusion of dike
swarms and the development of a coast-parallel, crustal mono-cline and
seaward-thickening wedge of basaltic lava. Strike-slip transfer structures
oriented at a high angle to the margin may accommodate along-strike variations
in magmatic dilation and exten-sional faulting. Bedding-parallel slip occurs
in sedimentary and vol-canic rock units. Slip on dike margins and dike
cooling joints are widespread in the dike swarms. Diffuse cataclastic zones
accom-modate strain variations between different units. 3) The last phase
of faulting includes mainly landward-dipping normal faults that cut the
dike swarms and overlying lava units and probably relates to sub-sidence
of the outer margin as seafloor spreading began farther off-shore. Cataclastic
textures and pseudotachylyte (seismogenic frictional melt) fault veins
and injection zones are developed in all three generations of faults. </P>

<P>Preliminary laser-probe 40Ar/39Ar dating of these fault rocks indicates
generation at ~62 Ma, in good accord with available geochronology of related
structures. These relations indicate that seismogenic faulting persisted
throughout the development of this VRM.</P>

<P><B>Infrastructure of the Coast Parallel Dyke Swarm Along the Rifted
Continental Margin of Southeast Greenland</B></P>

Centre, ster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; e-mail: mbk@dlc.ku.dk)

e-mail: jkarson@rogue.geo.duke.edu)</P>

<P>The Coast Parallel Dyke Swarm (CPDS) of SE Greenland was emplaced during
the Early Tertiary break-up of the Greenland-European continent and the
continued opening of the Atlantic Ocean (approx. 60-40 Ma). The CPDS is
composed of several dyke swarms that are exceptionally well exposed 250
km along strike, south of the inferred centre of the Proto-Icelandic Hot
Spot. Seven profiles across the dyke swarms, at approximately 40 km intervals,
form the basis for a detailed study on the infrastructure of the CPDS.</P>

<P>Several factors suggest that there are three major phases of regional
dyke intrusion; (1) an early phase of variably deformed and tilted tholeiitic
dykes related to the continental rifting and break-up, (2) a phase of volatile-rich
transitional to alkaline dykes emplaced at the continental margin during
a significant period of sea-floor spreading, and (3) a phase of dykes related
to the subaerial seafloor spreading, presently active in Iceland. The massive
transitional to alkaline phase of the CPDS amounts to roughly 2/3 of the
dilation of all dykes, and might be a characteristic feature of rifted
continental margins near ( 200 km) the centre of hot spots.</P>

<P>Detailed measurement of the of strike, dip, and thickness of the dykes
in each profile, combined with photogrammetry, generally shows; (1) a seaward
increase in the amount of dilation by dykes, (2) a seaward decrease in
the thickness of the dykes, and (3) a rotation towards progressively gentler
landward dips of the early tholeiitic dykes. The rotated early tholeiitic
dykes define, together with tilted sediments and lavas, a large-scale coast
parallel monocline. Variations, along the coast, in the geometry of the
monocline and the strike of the dyke swarms, is attributed to the segmentation
at accomodation zones that strike sub-perpendicular to the CPDS and are
dominated by strike-slip movement. A similar segment spacing (approx. 100
km) occurs in Iceland and might be &quot;inherited&quot; from the structure
of the continental margin.</P>

<P><B>Paleomagnetic Constraints on Low-Angle Normal Faulting in Serpentinites
on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 23 N</B></P>

<P>R M Lawrence, J A Karson (Department of Geology, Duke University, Durham,
NC 27708-0230; email: lawrence@geo.duke.edu), J S Gee (GRD, SIO, La Jolla,
CA 92093)</P>

<P>Serpentinites crop-out along the median valley walls of several spreading
center segments of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. At 23 N, in the MARK Area, the
Ocean Drilling Program (Site 920) recovered serpentinites exposed in the
footwall of a major low-angle normal (detachment) fault zone. Paleomagnetic
studies on the serpentinites provide important constraints on the kinematics
of this fault zone and the mode of exposure of these hydrated upper mantle
rocks. </P>

<P>At Site 920 the mixed harzburgite/lherzolite protolith has been serpentinized
40-90%. Oxygen isotope studies indicate a relatively high temperature of
serpentinization of 300 C. Magnetite formed during serpentinization is
the sole magnetic carrier in the samples. It is widely disseminated in
the mesh serpentine that replaces olivine and orthopyroxene and is also
concentrated in minor shear zones and as many as 4 generations of serpentine
veins. Paleomagnetic remanence studies demonstrate a very consistent univectorial
remanence (inclination = 32.7 1 ) throughout the entire 200 m vertical
section drilled. This is distinct from the predicted inclination of 41
, suggesting a possible tectonic rotation. Anisotropy of remanence experiments
show that despite strong anisotropy of susceptibility, there is only a
small deflection of remanence acquisition, resulting in a corrected inclination
of 38.2 1.5 .</P>

<P>This small remaining difference can be explained by either secular variations
or deviation of the drill hole from vertical. The magnetic results indicate
that there has been no significant tectonic rotation of the serpentinite
fabrics and veins since they formed. This implies that the low-angle serpentinite
detachment fault slipped in its present orientation and that footwall uplift
occurred without significant rotations, perhaps by slip on steeply dipping
faults. </P>

Cl Isotopes of the Stillwater Complex, Montana, and the Formation of High-Cl Bushveld and Stillwater Parent Liquids During Mantle Metasomatism by Cl-Rich Fluids.

</P>
<P>
M. Stewart, A. E. Boudreau (Both at: Department of Geology, Box 90227 Duke    University, Durham, NC, 27708  e-mail: mstewart@geo.duke.edu)

</P>
<P>
The hydrous igneous minerals of the Stillwater and Bushveld complexes and their associated marginal sills and dikes are unusually rich in Cl.  This is particularly true for rocks crystallized from more primitive liquids.  The first Cl isotope determinations from unaltered intercumulus biotite from the Stillwater Complex have delta 37-Cl values (normalized to seawater, 95% confidence limit error is 0.2 per mil) ranging from 0.27 to -0.93 and average -0.18.  These data imply an ultimate crustal source for the Cl.  However, field, petrographic and oxygen isotopic evidence suggests that high Cl fluids did not infiltrate from the country rocks, and lack of correlation between Cl with Sr isotopic variations in the Bushveld suggests Cl enrichment is not a direct result of assimilation of Cl-rich crustal rocks.  

</P>
<P>
It has been previously shown that Stillwater and Bushveld parent magmas have boninitic affinities.  For example, the high-Mg Bushveld parent magmas have low TiO2 but high K2O and light REE contents similar to modern day boninites.  These compositional characteristics have been interpreted to be the result of formation of these liquids from a mantle that had undergone an early basalt extraction event and then enriched by a later metasomatic event.  It is proposed that the early melt extraction event depleted the mantle in fluorine.  Subsequent metasomatism by a Cl-rich fluid produced a source rock with a high Cl/F ratio, aided the transport of the light REE and alkalis and may have initiated melting. The Cl isotopic data suggests that this fluid was derived from subducted crustal material.

</P>
<P>
Like modern day boninites, Stillwater and Bushveld magmas probably contained a much higher volatile content than is generally realized.  This volatile component should be considered when modeling the crystallization of these intrusions.

    <dd>Alan Boudreau joined the faculty in January 1989. His
        research has focused on understanding the crystallization
        of large layered intrusions, with particular attention on
        the Archean Stillwater complex in Montana. Although the
        classic bodies such as the Stillwater Complex have been
        extensively studied for many years, there is still
        surprising little agreement on how the rocks formed.
        Besides the intriguing problems proposed for the
        crystallization of magmas, these intrusions are host to
        important mineral reserves of Cu, Ni, Cr, Ti and the
        platinum-group elements. <p>Much of Boudreau's recent
        work has investigated the degassing history of these
        intrusions and the role of volatiles in the formation of
        the platiniferous ore zones hosted by both the Stillwater
        Complex and the Bushveld Complex in South Africa. The
        geological community is currently split between those who
        view the origins of the platinum deposits as a particular
        case of otherwise conventional fractional
        crystallization, and those who hold an emerging view that
        the ore horizons may have formed by volatile fluid
        transport of the ore elements during degassing of the
        crystal pile. Boudreau and his coauthors have shown that
        the halogen geochemistry of Stillwater and Bushveld
        hydrous mineral phases is distinctly much more Cl-rich
        than are seen in other, barren, layered intrusions.
        Current work is investigating the details of the
        stratigraphic variation of the halogens and the
        possibility of redistribution of Cl-complexed trace
        elements. </p>
        <p>Another fundamental problem involves the mechanisms by
        which igneous layering may develop. The conventional view
        is that most common examples of igneous layering form by
        gravitational settling of mineral grains. However,
        certain structures may have formed in alternative ways.
        The understanding of what structures are settling
        features and what structures formed by other, in situ,
        crystallization processes has become increasingly
        difficult to recognize. Boudreau has attempted to show
        that many examples of igneous layering may develop slowly
        over time and have more textural affinity with
        metamorphic differentiation layering. Parallels with
        patterns formed in the crystallization of salt solutions
        have been used to model fine-scale layering, where
        Boudreau has suggested that this type of layering
        develops during the aging of the crystal assemblage in a
        slowly cooling cumulate pile. In other work, Boudreau has
        presented evidence that certain anomalous changes in the
        crystallization sequence may be the result of mixing of
        volatile fluid as it migrates upward through the crystal
        pile to mix with hotter, melt + crystal assemblages which
        are not yet vapor saturated. These models challenge the
        conventional &quot;two magma&quot; mixing models often
        called upon to explain such features. The search for new
        observations to constrain and test these and other
        hypotheses are a major focus of these studies. </p>

<H3>Duke University is located in <A HREF =

"http://www.hickory.nc.us/ncnetworks/dur-intr.html">Durham, NC</A>, and is
a part of the rapidly growing Research Triangle Area which includes nearby
Raleigh and Chapel Hill. Durham is a city with a population of about
100,000, but the metropolitan area now includes over 700,000 residents. The
area offers rich and diverse educational, cultural, and recreational
opportunities.  Both the University of North Carolina and North Carolina
State University are located within 45 minutes of the Duke University
campus and Duke University students can readily access all university
libraries in the research triangle.  In addition Duke University students
can enroll in courses at other research triangle universities through a
reciprocity agreement.  Transportation in and out of the area is excellent
and is served by the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, which is only
about twenty minutes from Duke University.</H3>

    <dd><h6><b>HYDROGEOLOGY</b> </h6>
    </dd>
    <dd>The broad aim of Stuart Rojstaczer's research is to
        better understand the role of subsurface fluid flow in
        geologic and human-induced hazards. A subsidiary interest
        is in the development of new techniques to determine
        elastic and fluid flow properties of the Earth in situ. <p>Dr.
        Rojstaczer and his students have recently examined many
        research topics including: land subsidence in the San
        Joaquin-Sacramento Delta (a region critical to water
        supply in California); groundwater flow induced by
        tectonic activity along the San Andreas Fault; the
        mechanics of geysers; measurement of air permeability in
        the field; rates of flow and residence times of fluids in
        karst; and interpolation of permeability structure in the
        presence of sparse data. </p>
        <p>Central to the approach of examining these problems is
        the integration of field derived data with theory. The
        research frequently requires the use of novel field
        collection techniques or the use of conventional
        techniques in novel settings. The field data is used to
        constrain quantitative models that describe the physical
        and chemical processes underlying the observations. </p>
        <p>Dr. Rojstaczer is an Associate Editor of Water
        Resources Research and on the Editorial Board of Geology.
        He is a Fellow of the Geological Society of America, has
        received an award for excellent service from the U.S.
        Geological Survey, and has received a Young Investigator
        Award from the National Science Foundation. He is
        Director of the <a href="hydro.htm">Center for Hydrologic
        Science.</a></p>

Before settling on the lakes of tropical Africa Dan Livingstone studied folklore, a mastodon, formation of thaw lakes, chemical embryology, fisheries management, biogeography, phosphorus cycling in lakes, the chemical composition of lakes and rivers and the late-Quaternary pollen stratigraphy of Alaska and Nova Scotia. He is best known for designing a light-weight piston corer and for being tasted and rejected by a large Nile crocodile.

In Africa, Livingstone and his students study the circulation and chemical composition of lakes and how the distribution and abundance of organisms are affected by them. The aim is to understand tropical lakes as climatically-controlled ecological systems, and especially how the environment controls the properties of lake sediments.

This understanding is used with cores taken from lake sediments to work out the history of changing climate and changing vegetation. The ultimate aim is two-fold: to understand global climatic change and to see how the climatic history of Africa has affected the plants and animals that live there. Among the most interesting of those organisms are Homo sapiens and its hominid ancestors.

Livingstone is a recipient of the Evelyn Hutchinson Medal of the America Society for Limnology and Oceanography. At present, he is working on two problems: how to raise long undisturbed cores easily from ancient lakes, and how to improve the climatic inferences, especially with respect to temperature, that can be made from them.

<B>Detecting and Explaining Hydrologic Changes in the San 
Lorenzo River Basin due to the 1989 Loma Prieta 
Earthquake</B><P>

J K Hasan, E B Donaldson and S Rojstaczer (All at Department of 
Geology, Duke University, Box 90227, Durham, NC 27708; 919-
684-5245; internet hasan@rogue.geo.duke.edu)<P>

The Loma Prieta, California earthquake of 1989 induced hydrologic 
changes in the nearby San Lorenzo River basin, including increased 
baseflow (persisting for up to several months), declining water table 
elevations in the basin highlands, and increased dissolved ion 
concentrations in the streamwater.  Previous research suggests that 
these changes may be due to enhanced permeability in the shallow 
subsurface.  Permeability enhancement, if present, may also be 
detectable in the baseflow response of the river to storms.  Detecting 
the earthquake's effects on the basin's hydrology is, however, 
complicated by strongly seasonal patterns of rainfall and springflow 
and by the persistence of drought conditions over much of the past 15 
years.  We first employ a systems approach to examine the baseflow 
response to storms and deconvolve the basin's response functions to 
effective rainfall.  We examine whether these functions remain stable 
from year to year, and whether they change following the earthquake.  
We employ two techniques for deconvolution: multiple regression 
analysis and cross-correlation analysis.  Preliminary results suggest 
that multiple regression does not produce stable response functions 
for this basin on a daily time increment.  Cross-correlation produces 
stable response functions that suggest a 7-9 day peak lag between 
rainfall events and baseflow discharge.  These response functions are 
shown to be affected by the distribution and amount of rainfall during 
the given period, but otherwise they do not change after the 
earthquake.<P>

Our second approach is to use a physically based groundwater flow 
model to simulate pre- and post-seismic hydraulic head distributions 
and baseflow in the basin.  Modeling in areas of steep topography is 
problematic, and requires fine scale gridding and incorporation of 
significant vertical components of flow.  Our initial multilayer model 
has been calibrated to pre-earthquake steady state conditions.  Pre-
earthquake hydraulic conductivity and specific storage are of the order 
3.0 x 10-7 m/s and about 5.0 x 10-3 m-1, respectively.  Post-
earthquake changes in baseflow in the months following the 
earthquake require modeled conductivity increases of approximately 
one order of magnitude coincident with the earthquake.<P><P>



<B>Chemical Weathering and Denudation in the Pescadero Creek 
  Watershed, California</B><P>

R D Phillips and S Rojstaczer (both at Department of Geology,

The groundwater geochemistry of a mountainous, coastal watershed 
was assessed using a spatially-extensive array of baseflow samples 
collected during the summers of 1992 and 1993.  Despite extreme 
lithologic heterogeneity, trilinear diagrams show baseflow chemical 
compositions to be fairly uniform throughout the watershed.  Relative 
proportions of (Ca2+ + Mg2+), SO42-, and HCO3- indicate that the 
oxidation of pyrite and the dissolution of calcite and dolomite by 
H2SO4 and H2CO3 control the baseflow concentrations of these ions.  
A stability diagram for the Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O system suggests that 
the baseflow waters are in equilibrium with albite, kaolinite, and 
Na-montmorillonite.  Equilibrium with albite and Na-montmorillonite 
occurs in tributaries draining the Purisima Formation, which contains 
abundant andesitic and silicic volcanic fragments.  Equilibrium with 
albite and kaolinite occurs in Pescadero Creek and the remaining 
tributaries.  Historical chemical and discharge data from the USGS 
gaging station at Pescadero Creek indicate that these weathering 
processes control the chemistry of Pescadero Creek throughout the 
observed discharge range (15-83500 l/s).<P>

After correcting for cyclic salt inputs, baseflow chemical denudation 
rates were calculated for each subcatchment. Values range from 0.0004 
to 0.02 mm/yr and are directly proportional to the discharge per unit 
area of the subcatchment.  High-elevation subcatchments, which have 
the highest discharges due to the orographic enhancement of rainfall, 
tend to have the highest chemical denudation rates.  Historical data 
show that chemical denudation rates in the watershed range seasonally 
from 0.0006 to 0.65 mm/yr and are strongly correlated with discharge.  
The estimated mean chemical denudation rate for the watershed is 
0.03 mm/yr, approximately 7 times greater than the average baseflow 
chemical denudation rate.  Because a major part of dissolved load is 
contributed by relatively soluble carbonate and sulfide minerals, 
chemical denudation rates in the watershed appear to be constrained 
largely by the rate of discharge.<P><P>



<B>Uncoupling Regulatory Policies from Geosphere Transport Models of the
Subsurface</B><P>

Simulation models of subsurface fluid flow and transport are increasingly
used as a tool to evaluate compliance with environmental regulations. 
Models of subsurface fluid flow and transport can have value.  They can aid
in field data collection.  They can also help organize data and give an
investigator a quantitative tool to develop and test qualitative conceptual
models.  The common assumption made in using these models for regulatory
compliance is that they are able to accurately predict future flow and
transport.  Because these models often embed complex physical and chemical
processes, they are presumed to accurately represent the real world.  In
examining subsurface transport of fluids and contaminants, however, this
assumption is usually poor.  Models despite their complexity, are generally
incomplete, highly idealized versions of real world behavior.  It is
generally not possible for these models to incorporate all of the critical
processes and spatial variability that exists in the subsurface.  To some
extent, this limitation is one of limited theoretical understanding, but at
least equally important is that the nature of the subsurface is imprecisely
known.  As a result of these limitations and as a result of the
unpredictability of external factors such as climate,  it is generally not
possible for models to be used for accurate prediction of subsurface
behavior.  While valuable, subsurface fluid models are usually an
inadequate tool to test quantitative benchmarks for environmental
compliance.  Such inadequacy indicates that regulatory criteria for
subsurface contaminants that are highly dependent on quantitative results
of simulation models will often be inappropriate.  Establishing
quantitative regulatory criteria is inappropriate when legitimate
quantitative tests are not possible.<P><P>

Numerical simulations of multiphase transport suggest combinations of rock
properties and boundary conditions that lead to geyser-like discharge.  Our
model consists of a highly permeable porous conduit surrounded by a less
permeable matrix.  The conduit is supplied energy from below by a constant
flux of heat or fluid mass at a fixed enthalpy. Within the rather narrow
range of conditions that allow geyser-like discharge, the dynamic character
of the geyser is highly sensitive to the permeabilities of the geyser
conduit and the surrounding rock matrix, and to pressure gradients in the
matrix.  Both unimodal and multimodal geyser periodicity can occur,
depending on the nature of the assumed relative permeability functions.
Under conditions of limited matrix permeability, the response of the system
to very small changes in initial conditions (both enthalpy and pressure)
can cause significant temporary changes in geyser timing and volume of
discharge.  After several geyser cycles, however, the geyser discharge time
series is largely insensitive to perturbations in initial conditions.  The
geyser discharge time series, when integrated to determine total discharge
per eruption interval, appears to be free of deterministic chaos.  Neither
prediction of the total geyser discharge or geyser periodicity degrades
significantly over course of several hundred geyser cycles. <P>

These results suggest that the observed sensitivity of natural geysers to
small strains such as those caused by remote earthquakes, fluctuations in
barometric pressure, and earth tides are strongly controlled by changes in
rock properties and boundary conditions.  Co- and post-seismic changes in
geyser frequency may be caused by ground-motion-induced permeability
changes.  Periodic loading may affect geyser activity by altering mass flux
between the matrix and geyser conduit.  If our model adequately describes
the intrinsic physics of the geyser inititation process, chaotic behavior
of geyser periodicity, when present, is likely governed by the chaotic
nature of external factors such as climate.<P><P>

Hydrologic changes are observed in response to major and moderate-scale
earthquakes.  The changes, which usually involve increases in streamflow
and springflow, have recently been attributed to two significantly
different mechanisms: the expulsion of water from upper to mid-crustal
depths due to elastic compression1 and near-surface permeability
enhancement2,3,4.  If these flows are the result of closure of cracks in
the mid-to-upper-crust, then sampling earthquake affected streams and
springs may provide information about the nature of fluids at depth1. 
Alternatively if the hydrologic changes reflect only shallow processes,
then the behavior of these fluids provides insight into the rheologic
response of shallow earth materials to earthquakes.  The Loma Prieta
(California, USA) earthquake (October 17, 1989, M 7.0) provides a detailed
data base to examine hydrologic changes associated with earthquakes.  Here
we show that both the hydrologic response shortly after the earthquake and
the hydrology of the region several years after the earthquake are most
readily explained by earthquake-induced, permeability changes in the
shallow subsurface that are persistent and widespread.<P>

	This study was conducted to determine historical trends in subsidence in
the Delta and their environmental controls.  Historical subsidence was
determined by measuring soil surface elevation-loss near electrical tower
foundations and by evaluating survey data between 1922 and 1981.  The data
indicated that subsidence slowed over time.  In the western Delta, average
subsidence rates were 2.3 cm yr-1 from 1910-1988 and 1.5 cm yr-1 from
1952-1988.  Spatially variability in subsidence was correlated with
organic-matter content of soil  (r2=0.62) which in turn was related to the
depositional and drainage history of the Delta.  Subsidence rates appeared
to be independent of crops grown.<P>

 Air diffusivity in two zones over a 4.6 m interval of the unsaturated zone
was determined through analysis of atmospheric pressure and soil gas
pressure time series.  Regression analysis was used to calculate the ratio
of amplitudes (admittance) and phase lag between these series at diurnal
and semi-diurnal frequencies.  The admittance for each of the monitoring
zones was close to unity for both frequencies.  Phase lags between the two
time series were statistically equivalent to zero at the diurnal frequency,
but were as large as 20 7  at the semi-diurnal frequency. The phase lag at
diurnal and semi-diurnal frequencies for each zone was compared to a
diffusional model of soil gas pressure response to atmospheric loading. 
>From this comparison, a composite air diffusivity was determined for each
zone.  Composite air diffusivity ranged from 14 cm2/s  over the depth
interval 0-0.8 m to 70 cm2/s over the depth interval 0-4.6 m.  The absence
of large variability in air diffusivity and the trends in phase shift with
depth suggests that macropores or fractures propagate through a clay layer
at a depth of 0.5-1.2 m.  The length of the time series (110 days), allowed
for the examination of the magnitude of temporal changes in air
diffusivity.  Phase lag and apparent diffusivities decrease over time. 
However, the trends in phase lag are smaller than the error bounds in the
phase estimates and conflict with an apparent drying of the soil over time.
 Air diffusivity determined from the entire time record deviated only
slightly from the average diffusivity determined from the analysis of a
sequence of partial records.<P>

<DD>William Schlesinger, a joint appointee in the Department of Botany and the Division of Earth Sciences, is interested in global biogeochemistry, particularly the role of soils in global element cycles.  In a variety of synthetic papers, he has provided estimates of the amount of organic matter in world soils, the rate of change in this pool due to human activities, and the transport of organic compounds from land to sea in riverflow.  The pool of carbon in soils is one of the largest surface reservoirs in the global carbon cycle, and losses of soil organic matter upon cultivation contribute to the increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Many of Dr. Schlesinger's estimates are frequently seen in models of the global carbon cycle.
<P>
Much of his recent field work has focussed on the southwestern United States, where he studies the changes in soils associated with the transition between semiarid grasslands and desert shrublands in the process of desertification. In these studies, he has examined the role of overland runoff in controlling the distribution and abundance of shrubs in the Mojave Desert.  Runoff patterns also affect soil chemistry in deserts, including the deposition of calcium carbonate, or caliche, in desert soils.  Recently, in southern New Mexico, he has examined the production of gaseous ammonia in desert soils.  This process represents a loss of soil fertility to deserts, and it affects rainfall chemistry in regions that are downwind of desert ecosystems.  Dr. Schlesinger's desert research is supported by the Long-term Ecological Research Program (LTER) of the National Science Foundation.

<H4>ABSTRACT
</H4></CENTER>
One index of the stability of desert pavements is the presence of seated,
well-varnished surface clasts with orange undersides. The stability of
these clasts in terms of orientation must exceed the time for varnish
formation, probably several thousand years. An index of the instability of
desert pavements is the presence of surface clasts with orange varnish
layers oriented upwards, indicating that the clasts have been overturned.
Observations in 1994 and 1995 showed that some pavement surfaces in the
Mojave Desert, California, had been recently disturbed by animal activity,
probably by kangaroo rats (Dipodomys), with widespread overturning of
varnished clasts up to 5 cm in diameter and exposure of orange bottoms.
Clasts that can be identified as overturned must have been sufficiently
stable prior to overturning to grow a coat of varnish, implying that the
observed widespread overturning events are infrequent. Disturbed areas were
not randomly distributed, but were apparently associated with animal
foraging in patches of sparse annual vegetation (Oligomeris linifolia). Up
to 60% of some pavement surfaces were subject to disturbance. Because
pavements are mechanically weak, relatively small perturbations, such as a
heavier than usual growth of Oligomeris, can lead to substantial disruption
after millennia of stability. Pavement longevity is more a function of
stability of the surrounding environment, including climate, than of
mechanical strength of the surface. Old but delicate desert pavement
surfaces may be a kind of geologic "canary", responding rapidly to small
changes in environmental conditions.<P>

probability of displacement each year. <A HREF = "/gifs/haff4.gif"><IMG SRC = "/gifs/haff4tn.gif">Fig. 4 </A>shows (black bars) the
distribution of sizes for stones on a small patch of pavement that were not
displaced over a twelve month period, and (gray bars) the distribution of
sizes for that fraction of stones that did move detectably over this same
time period. Displacement is apparently due mostly to agitation by small
animals such as kangaroo rats and rabbits, and to raindrop impact. Stones
in this mobile population are often either unvarnished, or varnished
equally on all sides. However, somewhat larger clasts, with diameters
greater than about 3 or 4 cm, are often coated with a layer of brown
manganese-rich varnish on the upper (subaerial) surface, and a reddish or
orange iron-rich and manganese-poor layer on their buried bottom side.
Formation of desert varnish is thought to take thousands of years of
subaerial exposure to form, suggesting that clasts with brown varnish on
their upper surface and with buried orange undersides have been seated in
their present orientation for millennia.<P>



Observations of pavement surfaces in Greenwater Valley, California, in 1994
and 1995 showed widespread areas of dislodgement and displacement of stones
up to 5 cm in diameter.<A HREF = "/gifs/haff5.gif"><IMG SRC = "/gifs/haff5tn.gif"> Fig. 5</A> shows an area of pavement subject to such
disturbances. The disturbed areas (arrow) stand out by their slightly
rougher appearance in the photograph. The increased pavement roughness is
due to the presence of many unseated, uptilted, and overturned stones,

a pen. The lower panel of Fig. 9 shows that intact pavement contains some
loose stones (gray bars); these correspond to the mobile-size fraction
common to all pavement surfaces, as shown in<A HREF = "/gifs/haff4.gif"><IMG SRC = "/gifs/haff4tn.gif">Fig. 4.</A> In contrast, the upper
panel shows that seated and unseated clasts on disturbed pavement have
comparable size distributions, and that the mean clast sizes of both
populations are greater than that of the mean clast size of seated stones
on the undisturbed pavement.<P>


Localized unseating and overturning of stones as large as 5 cm in diameter
is thought to be due to animal activity. No other agency of disruption is
known that could account for such displacements while leaving adjacent
pavement intact. Such disturbances to the pavement must be infrequent,
since clasts with orange undersides that probably have been in situ for a
thousand years or more have been displaced and overturned.<P>

The origin of clast displacement is thought to be associated with foraging
activity of rodents such as the kangaroo rat (Dipodomys), a common
inhabitant of areas in the Mojave Desert where pavement occurs. Foraging is
not random, but is focussed where suitable vegetation grows. Rooted
fragments of small annual plants are abundant on disturbed pavement
patches. Intact pavement may or may not support annual plants. Oligomeris
linifolia is a common annual identified on disturbed pavement, <A HREF = "/gifs/haff10.gif"><IMG SRC = "/gifs/haff10tn.gif">Fig. 10. </A>and

<H4>SUMMARY</H4>
</CENTER>
On some pavements, large (up to 5 cm) varnished clasts that have presumably
been in situ and in the same orientation for on the order of a few thousand
years, have recently (within last few years, probably in 1993 or possibly
in 1994) been dislodged and overturned. This can have been accomplished
only by animal activity of a kind distinct from the usual cross-pavement
travel which is known [Haff, unpub.] to dislodge small stones (typically
less than about 1 cm, as in <A HREF = "/gifs/haff4.gif"><IMG SRC = "/gifs/haff4tn.gif">Fig. 4 </A>or bottom panel <A HREF = "/gifs/haff9.gif"><IMG SRC = "/gifs/haff9tn.gif">Fig. 9).</A> Localized,
energetic bioturbation was probably caused by the availability of food in
the form of abundant annual plants (Oligomeris), remnants of which were
still visible in 1994 and 1995 on disturbed pavement patches, but not
elsewhere. Oligomeris grows preferentially, for reasons unknown, on
pavement surfaces characterized by a slight but distinct increase in clast
size, which consequently is the type of surface most likely to be
disrupted, even though its larger clast size would otherwise imply a
greater stability.<P>

<CENTER><H4> CONCLUSIONS</H4></CENTER>

The cause of the heavy Oligomeris growth is unknown, but may be linked to
climate fluctuations such as increased precipitation. Both 1993 and 1994
were generally wet winters in the desert southwest. The occurrence of the
Hanta virus in New Mexico has been directly linked to expansions of rodent
populations driven by increases in the biomass of annual vegetation.
Although desert pavements are stable over many millennia, they are
mechanically weak. Their stability is due mostly to stability of the local
environment, not to mechanical strength. Small changes in the forces
exerted on pavement surfaces, such as those due to relatively small changes
in climate, can be expected to exert large disruptive effects on pavement
morphology and integrity. In other words, desert pavement surfaces may play
the role of a "canary", sensitive to some aspects of environmental change.
Long-term monitoring of selected pavement surfaces might be a worthwhile
undertaking.<P>

Repeat photography and other experiments on desert pavement surfaces in the
Mojave Desert have shown that smaller pavement stones suffer frequent
displacement. Trafficking by animals such as kangaroo rats and rabbits,
together with raindrop impact, are thought to be energy sources for this
cross-pavement flux of stones. Lateral diffusion of surface stones
represents a powerful smoothing and repair mechanism for pavement surfaces.
Diffusing clasts are measurably smaller than average-sized stones on the
ambient pavement (0.9 cm vs. 1.2 cm in one case). Topographic depressions,
including gully heads, tend to collect this smaller material. Finer-grained
diffusive infill is widely distributed in gully-heads across the Mojave
Desert. Mean gully-head position is determined by competition between
diffusion and erosion by overland flow. Overland flow discharge rates
necessary to dislodge and transport gully pavement infill can be estimated
through flow experiments in the field. Preliminary experiments with a
portable flume deployed on an infilled gully-head in Greenwater Valley,
California, suggest that a localized, short time-scale, rainfall intensity
on the order of 20cm/hr is needed to mobilize the infill gravel. Infill
times are estimated, on the basis of long-term (decadal) experiments
measuring modern diffusion rates, to be on the order of a few thousand
years. These preliminary results indicate that assessment of local
paleo-storm intensities might be possible across a wide geographic area
defined by the occurrence of desert pavement.<P>

<H2>Test of Scale Invariance of Hydrological Constitutive Laws

</B><P>
Hydrological constitutive laws relate basin area to
stream flow and sediment flux.  Historically,
power-law forms of such relationships have been
preferred.  While some justification for such
assumptions could be sought in (relatively) recent
results regarding scale invariance in basin topography,
in related solid -state transport problems, such
scale invariance often proves irrelevant to transport
properties.  A test of the relevance of scale-invariance
to transport is based on a real-space renormalization
procedure in a heterogeneous basin with no infiltration.
The renormalization characterizes the flow of a region
of area $n^2A$ as equal to the largest contributing
stream flow within the n subregions of identical areas,
$A$.  Extreme-value statistics relate the renormalizaed
distribution of stream flows to the original, the
factor $n^2$ renormalizes the area.  The conditions
under which power-law forms for the constitutive laws
result will be defined.

<H2>Constitutive Laws and Prediction in Granular Systems</H2>
</CENTER>
<B>P. K. Haff</B>


        Constitutive properties of large-scale granular systems are likely
to be unique or ill-defined as the result of history effects, compositional
variation, and absence of suitable averaging volumes. In consequence,
fundamental physical studies of granular systems at laboratory scale can
contribute in only a limited way to quantitative numerical prediction of
the behavior of large-scale granular systems.<P>

        To what extent is the behavior of large complex systems reducible
to the underlying physics? If theoretical models of a well-characterized
physical system at the laboratory scale are found to describe its behavior
over a wide range of conditions, can this understanding be scaled up and
used as the basis of predictive numerical models to describe large-scale
systems that might be characteristic of engineering or geological
applications?  Such scaling is usually attempted on the basis of
constitutive laws. Constitutive "laws" are the interface between the
microscale dynamical behavior that is normally invisible (unresolved) in
ordinary applications and the macroscopic scale at which we choose to
formulate a predictive framework such as a partial differential equation.
Laboratory flume experiments and computer simulations on the transport of
sand and gravel by water provide insight into mechanisms and the mechanics
of bedload transport. Such studies provide the basis for the development of
constitutive rules [Vanoni, 1977] that are taken to summarize transport
behavior in a compact form for use in practical transport studies. In fluid
mechanics, the stress-strain term in the Navier-Stokes equation (or some
approximation thereto) is such a constitutive law for Newtonian flows. If a
constitutive relation is valid for a given system, then physical
large-scale modeling (e.g., estuary flushing, ocean currents, or bridge
scour, reservoir sedimentation) can be attempted with the relatively small
number of degrees of freedom of the macroscopic equation. The question
raised here is whether such a constitutive strategy, in which the basic
physical behavior of many degrees of freedom is summarized at the small
scale via a simple rule or "law", is likely to be effective as a basis for
constructing numerical predictive models of granular systems.<P>
        The answer is likely to be "no"; that large-scale granular systems
may, in general, not be susceptible to predictive modeling in the same way
that fluid systems and other classical physical systems are. The
fundamental reason is that granular behavior often cannot be summarized in
simple and universal constitutive laws that can then used as the basis of
large-scale prediction.<P>
        In a container of water the fundamental constituents (molecules of
water) are all identical. Over a wide range of conditions (e.g., pressure,
shear rate) the constitutive relation for fluid flow changes only slightly.
Thus, the constitutive laws for water in different containers are found to
be essentially identical. Water is a material with universal and
(relatively) simple flow properties.<P>
        This is generally not the case for granular materials. Granules are
not identical; each one is unique. Two containers of nominally the "same"
granular material are different from one another at the granular level, and
they also differ macroscopically because of history effects (discussed
below). Of course, two containers of granular material can be prepared so
that they are similar in many respects. Do residual "small" differences
between the "similar" granular systems make a significant difference in the
constitutive behavior of the systems? Probably not if the systems are
prepared carefully enough, else repeatable laboratory experiments would not
be possible. However, in large-scale applications where the displacements
of large volumes of materials occur, the physical systems are not usually
carefully prepared. In geological systems (e.g., landslides) there is
essentially no control over system "preparation". The term "large-scale"
inevitably implies a substantial lack of knowledge about the small-scale
nature of the medium, and constitutive laws are therefore likely to be
poorly known.<P>
        One illustration of "small" variations in system constitution
leading to large constitutive effects, and hence large macroscopic effects,
is the role of moisture in granular systems. Sand transport by the wind
[Bagnold, 1984] is sensitive to small amounts of surface moisture on grains
[Horikawa, 1988]. A water content of 10% can lead to an increase in
threshold transport velocities from 3m/s to 20m/s, compared to dry sand.
This corresponds to a huge effect on total transport rates. The most common
constitutive laws for sand transport [Bagnold, 1984] are functions of wind
speed, grain size, and surface roughness. In well-controlled laboratory
studies, there is little doubt that the effects of specified moisture
content of the sand could be determined, and more complex constitutive laws
developed. However, in actual applications of interest - for example,
erosion studies of sand transport across a beach - the moisture content is
not known. The moisture content may be highly variable and changing by the
hour. Empirical constitutive rules could be derived for selected localities
under specified conditions that helped account for moisture effects, and
indeed, empirical analysis that relies on local observation and makes use
of past experience is a valid way of analyzing such complex systems. But
this approach is very different from an attempt to take a fundamental
physical understanding of a system at a small scale, and then to "scale it
up" into a quantitative large-scale predictive model.<P>
        This example illustrates the problem for constitutive modeling of
systems where small-scale granular properties are not controlled. The point
is that such properties cannot be controlled for large-scale granular
systems. Moisture, surface contaminants, abrasion and fracture of grains,
uncertainties in size and shape distribution of grains, and the variation
of these factors in space and time, all lead to difficulties in defining
specifically the system composition. The constitutive laws are
correspondingly difficult to specify.<P>
        A second difficulty in defining granular constitutive laws arises
from the question of averaging volume. In continuum mechanics, one is used
to assuming the existence of a small volume over which appropriate average
values of relevant variables (pressure, temperature, etc.) can be defined.
This volume is taken to be very small with respect to the dimensions of the
macroscopic system, and very large with respect to the size of the
microscopic constituents (e.g., molecules). For many granular systems, such
a volume may not exist, either because substantial variations in flow or
deformation occur across lengths measured in small numbers of grain
diameters (this is typical granular behavior arising from the inelasticity
of grain-grain interactions), or because structure appears in the flow at a
variety of length scales. For example, two-dimensional chute flows show the
existence of macroscopic "crystalline" regions of highly correlated grain
motion which are large compared to system dimensions, but not necessarily
large on the scale of a grain diameter. Whereas structure arises
spontaneously in turbulent fluid flow (e.g., eddies), appropriate averaging
volumes exist in that case that are much smaller than the smallest eddy,
and consequently the fundamental stress-strain relations remain valid. For
granular systems, it is not always clear whether such averaging volumes
exist. Since it is at the level of the averaging volume that constitutive
laws are usually expressed, constitutive laws for some granular systems may
contain inherent inaccuracies based upon inappropriate assumptions about
averaging.<P>
        Finally, the history of a granular system can strongly affect its
constitutive properties. The variability of properties of individual
constituent grains allows for segregation of particles according to size,
shape and other parameters. In shear flows or in vibrated media large
particles often rise toward the free surface. In shear-bands, enhanced
erosion and comminution of grains, as well as dynamical segregation
processes, can lead to localized grain-size variations. Therefore, strong
intrinsic history effects are present in essentially all granular materials
in the form of internal structures reflecting past deformational or
depositional processes. These structures may strongly influence
constitutive behavior. Thus, abandoned shear zones may be loci of incipient
weakness that can drastically affect system behavior if activated. In
large-scale granular systems, extrinsic history effects may also be
present. The weathering of particulates in a geologic deposit due to
infiltration of water and chemicals from outside the system leads to local
changes with time of granular properties and hence of constitutive
relations. (On the contrary, the constitutive behavior of non-history
dependent materials, like water, remains constant with time, even in large
"unprepared" systems.)  For such reasons most large-scale granular systems
are sufficiently heterogeneous that they are characterized not by a single
constitutive law, but by a distribution of constitutive laws. These
distributions may be unique for each system, so that, unlike in small-scale
experiments, the behavior of large-scale systems may not be repeatable.<P>
         As a consequence of nonuniqueness in system composition,
uncertainty in internal structure arising from system history, and possible
lack of suitable averaging strategies, models based on underlying physics
may not play the same predictive role in geological and large-scale
engineering systems involving granular materials that they do in
small-scale well-controlled laboratory systems or in large systems where
constitutive behavior is uniform and fixed (e.g., fluids).<P>

  Gullies incised into mature desert pavement often head in paved shallow
bowls or swales. Pebbles comprising the swale pavement are slightly smaller
in diameter on average (1.1 cm in one location) than pebbles forming the
surrounding ambient pavement (1.6 cm). Excavation of some pavement swales
reveals the presence of buried pavement stones with a size distribution
similar to that of the ambient pavement. The buried stones in some cases
form an intact desert pavement surface, while in other cases they seem to
represent a disaggregated pavement.<P>
  Measurements of modern rates of clast displacement on desert pavements
show that diffusive dispersion of small stones, similar in size to those in
gully swales, is an active process today. Mechanisms responsible for clast
diffusion include animal activity and probably raindrop impact. Burial of
swale pavement and generation of a new overlying paved surface is
indicative of an increase over time in the effectiveness of diffusive
processes relative to the advective hydraulic processes that are
responsible for gully incision.<P>
  Discharges required to initiate movement of clasts of the modern infill
pavement are likely to be less than discharges that were once needed to
mobilize buried pavement (when it was exposed). Measurements of critical
discharges necessary for clast displacements on modern gully-swale
pavements and on excavated pavements may be able to provide quantitative
information on the maximum intensity of local storm events occurring in an
earlier period when flow was sufficient to compete effectively with
diffusion.<P>

        One index of the stability of desert pavements is the presence of
seated, well-varnished surface clasts with orange undersides. The stability
of these clasts in terms of orientation must exceed the time for varnish
formation, probably several thousand years. An index of the instability of
desert pavements is the presence of surface clasts with orange varnish
layers oriented upwards, indicating that the clasts have been overturned.
Observations in 1994 and 1995 showed that some pavement surfaces in the
Mojave Desert, California, had been recently disturbed by animal activity,
probably by kangaroo rats (Dipodomys), with widespread overturning of
varnished clasts up to 5 cm in diameter and exposure of orange bottoms.
Disturbed areas were not randomly distributed, but were associated with
patches of sparse annual vegetation (Oligomeris linifolia). Boundaries
between vegetation growth and unvegetated areas were usually sharp, as were
boundaries between disturbed and undisturbed pavement. Up to 60% of some
pavement surfaces were subject to disturbance. Clasts that can be
identified as overturned must have been sufficiently stable prior to
overturning to grow a coat of varnish, implying that the observed
widespread overturning events are infrequent. If animal disturbance of
pavement were in fact promoted by an unusual abundance of annual
vegetation, then the modern distribution of well-seated and varnished
pavement may reflect the same factors that control the occurrence of such
vegetation. To the extent that climate is such a factor, limitations on the
magnitude of past climatic fluctuations in the Mojave Desert are implied by
the presence of mature desert pavement today.

Sources of uncertainty or error that arise in attempting to scale-up the
results of laboratory-scale sediment transport studies for purposes of
large-scale simulation include: (i) model imperfection, (ii) omission of
important processes, (iii) lack of knowledge of initial conditions, (iv)
sensitivity to initial conditions, (v) unresolved heterogeneity, (vi)
occurrence of external forcing, and (vii) inapplicability of the factor of
safety concept. Sources of uncertainty that are unimportant or that can be
controlled at small scales and over short times become important in
large-scale applications and over long time scales. Control and
repeatability, hallmarks of laboratory-scale experiments, are usually
lacking at sufficiently large scales. Heterogeneity is an important
concomitant of size, and tends to make large systems unique. Uniqueness
implies that prediction cannot be based upon first-principles quantitative
modeling alone, but must be a function of system history as well.  Periodic
data collection, feedback, and model updating are essential where
site-specific prediction is required. In large sediment transport systems,
the construction of successful predictive models is likely to be based upon
discovery of emergent variables and a corresponding dynamics, rather than
upon scaling-up the results of well-controlled laboratory-scale studies.<P>

<P>
<DD>Dale Gillette recently was appointed an Adjunct Professor of Geology.  He is interested in eolian processes and has concentrated on mechanisms of wind erosion and applications to geology and ecology.   He has provided information of many of the mechanisms of wind erosion..  Among those mechanisms are sandblasting (production of fine particles by saltating (hopping) sand grains),  protection of the soil by plants and lag deposits, and  resistance soils to wind erosion.  A major application of the work was in making estimates for alkaline substances capable of neutralizing acid rain for the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program.    

<DD>Much of his recent activity centers around field experiments at Owens Lake, California, and starting in Spring 1994, the Jornada del Muerto Long Term Ecological Research Program headed by Duke Professor William Schlesinger.  Dr. Gillette headed the multinational wind erosion/dust emission experiment called Lake Owens Dust Experiment (LODE) which is being analyzed currently.    One of the primary areas of focus was the mechanics of wind erosion and dust production. 

      Work was finished on analysis of the cause of the fetch effect.   The fetch effect (the
increase or decrease of mass flux of airborne eroded soil particles with downwind distance) was
shown to be caused by three mechanisms:  (a) "avalanching" of soil particles where one particle
would dislodge one or more particles upon impact of the surface;  (b) aerodynamic feedback
where aerodynamic properties are changed by the airborne particles; and  (c)  change of soil
resistance with change  of the soil composition and size distribution.

"America's foremost philosopher of the beaches, the sea bottoms and the
coastal sands...is challenging some long-held notions about the ways in
which people use and maintain beaches.  A decade ago, when [Pilkey] began
warning of the dangers of 'beach degradation,' he found little public
support.  Today, as concern for our shore environment grows, people are
listening."
<UL>
<LI>Barnard L. Collier, The New York Times Magazine
</UL>
<P>
"Maps show what is happening on each stretch of the beach, in enough
detail to cover specific homesites.  The book offers guidelines for
buying and building at the shore.  They list federal, state and local
agencies that are involved in coastal development as well as give
up-to-date information on laws that regulate land use."

<DT><B><H5>SEISMOLOGY AND TECTONICS OF THE EARTH'S CRUST</H5>
</B>
<DD>Peter Malin joined Duke Geology in 1991 after more than a decade as a research seismologist at the University of Southern California and the University of California. His interests include tectonics, seismic wave propagation, and earthquakes, with current focus on central California. Since seismic waves are inseparable from the geology in which they originate and travel, his research has become increasingly interdisciplinary, emphasizing the application of structural and mechanical models to seismic observations.

Current projects at Duke include the mechanics of the San Andreas fault at Parkfield, the seismotectonics of the Coso Geothermal area, and seismic exploration of the southern Sierra Nevada, Owens Valley, and San Joaquin regions. The Duke associated downhole seismometer networks at Parkfield and Coso have revealed patterns in seismicity that suggest the interaction of aseismic and seismic fault slip. This interaction may account for the transfer of fault strain over many seismic-rupture lengths and at non- elastic speeds.

The lines on the relief map in the photo to the left show the location of the crossed, 300 km long refraction profiles being collected in the Sierra Nevada/ Death Valley region by Duke and several other universities in 1993. The geodynamic question they address is the relationship of simultaneous Tertiary uplift of the Sierras and extension of Death Valley, which are separated by only 2 times the local crustal thickness. End member models with and without an isostatic root to the Sierras have been proposed by others. The seismic profiles have been designed to resolve between them.

Duke students and staff have joined in all aspects of these projects. The seismic networks offer the chance for hands-on study of seismicity and earthquake mechanics. The active seismic profiling projects provide experience with seismic imaging of crustal structure. <P>

<h2>About KidSource OnLine </h2>
</center>

<blockquote>

<h3> Our Vision</h3>

<p>Welcome to KidSource OnLine!  We are a group of parents who want to make a positive and lasting difference in the lives of parents and children.  We've created an online community that shares our values and goals in raising, educating and providing for our children. We believe that parents and caregivers want to take greater responsibility for their children's health and education, but don't always have the right information, resources or advice to do so.  Our goal is to provide that knowledge and  advice to help you better raise and educate your children. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Our Focus </h3>

<p>As you visit our site, you'll see we focus primarily on health and education related issues. We've found that these are the number one concerns for many parents today.  And, it has been much too difficult for the typical parent to find timely, accurate and helpful information in these areas.
So, our goal is to find the best of the healthcare and education information for you and deliver it to you in new and innovative ways that will make it of greater benefit to you and your family.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>

We are a group of parents who love our children and after many years have come to the conclusion that we need to "love what we do and do what we love". So we combined our love of our children with our expertise with computers and marketing and created KidSource OnLine.   
<br><br>
We bring with us a wide range of talents.  Not only are we parents, we also have extensive experience in computers, marketing, engineering, healthcare, education and other related areas.       
<hr>
<h3>Our Site </h3>

<p>We're organized in two parts - our content (or answers) and our discussion (or Forums). Each provides different information and  different views on raising and educating our children.  We tie these areas together so that when you need help, you can find it from all possible sources. </p>

<p>You'll notice that we're light on graphics and have a straightforward layout.  This is intentional (much to the chagrin of our graphic artist friends).  Most of our visiting parents, do not have time to wait for extensive graphics to download, especially when they are connected via a 14.4 or a 28.8 modem, or through an online service.    We respect the time and performance constraints of our visiting parents and will upgrade our design as our visitors upgrade their systems. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Our Public Service Area</h3>

<p>We also want to make a difference in the lives of other children - not just those of the KidSource OnLine family.  So we've started a series of public service forums.  The first of these is Computing EDGE - a donation program that matches needy schools with the used, obsolete or excess computing equipment from corporations or individuals. It is our way of giving back to the community.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Sponsorship Opportunities </h3>

<p>KidSource OnLine has a variety of sponsorship programs.  Contact us for a rate card and a demographic profile of our visitors. We'll be glad to work with you to design a sponsorship program to match your needs.

Girls' mathematic achievement in the elementary gradesisequal to boys' but decreases in the middle school  (Callahan&amp;Clements, 1984; Dossey et al., 1988). An analysis of mathachievementof twelfth grade girls in 15 countries revealed that in all butthreecountries girls were less successful than boys (Hanna, Kundiger,&amp;Larouche, 1990). That gender differences seem not to surface untilageten (Callahan &amp; Clements, 1984; Dossey, Mulis, Lindquist, &amp;Chambers,1988) suggests that the decline of female achievement is theresult ofa strong pattern of socialization to mathematics success orfailurerather than to gender differences in innate ability.</P><P>Asgirls progress through school, they are less likely to continuetheir matheducation, either taking more rudimentary courses ordropping the subjectaltogether (Pallas &amp; Alexander, 1983).</P><P>This digest reviewscommon teaching practices and methods ofcommunication in theclassroom--known as discourse--to indicate thetreatment of female studentsthat inhibits their ability tosuccessfully learn math. It also identifiessome negative attitudesabout female mathematics achievement held byteachers and parents thatmay deter girls from continuing their matheducation.</P><HR><a name="Socialization"></a><H3>Socialization IssuesIn Female Mathematics Achievement</H3><P>Why females lose interest inmath is the result of a number offactors, among them a decline inself-esteem and capitulation to theforces of socialization that encouragegirls to focus on their bodiesat the expense of a whole-person orachievement orientation.Historically, the adage, "math is not for girls,"and the belief thatgirls should not reveal their intelligence lest itcompromise theirsexual desirability (and, thus, their social role aswife/mother),have combined to squelch girls' interest in advancedmathematics.Moreover, girls often are not given information aboutcareerpossibilities requiring competence in advanced mathematics.Neitherare they introduced to women role models with successful mathcareers,although, in general, role models can be an important factorinelevating a young person's aspirations.</P><P>At home, parents mayunconsciously fail to provide support for theirdaughters' interest inmath, either by directing their interestselsewhere or by giving all theirsupport for education to their sons.The attitudes of teachers and malestudents usually reinforce parents'message.</P><a href="#contents">Backto the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="Gender"></a><H3>GenderDifferences In Learning Styles</H3><P>Evidence exists that males andfemales tend to approach learning froma different perspective, althoughthe reasons for the differencescontinue to be debated.</P><P>In theclassroom, females prefer to use a conversational style thatfosters groupconsensus and builds ideas on top of each other; theinterrelationship ofthoughts and actions is paramount. Males,conversely, learn throughargument and individual activity--behaviorsfostered early. Most classroomdiscourse is organized to accommodatemale learning patterns (Ong,1981).</P><P>In addition, females are not likely to believe that math hasutilityin their lives (Fennema &amp; Sherman, 1978); they see math asunconnectedto a relationship model of thinking. Even if they persist intakingmath courses, girls are apt to find that they don't like them,andliking a subject is key to succeeding at it (Lockhead,Thorpe,Brooks-Gunn, Casserly, &amp; McAloon, 1985).</P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="Traditional"></a><H3>TraditionalTeaching Methods And Curricula</H3><P>The classroom structure, designedto foster independentnon-collaborative thinking, is most supportive ofwhite male,middle-class socialization models, and it continues throughuniversity(Pearson &amp; West, 1991). It encourages sex-role stereotypedforms ofcommunication--independence, dominance, assumption ofleadership--inwhich males have been trained to excel. Women, conversely,feeluncomfortable and excluded in situations requiring such behavior;yet,their participation--as questioners as well asnewly-mintedauthorities--may be critical to knowledge acquisition andschoolsuccess. The importance that women place on mutual support,buildingcollaborative knowledge, and applying it practically is devaluedincomparison with the importance of individual expertise to malesandtheir inclination to debate abstract concepts.</P><P>Math curriculaoften exploit the differences between males and femalesby drawing on theirdifferent early play experiences. Action toys forboys teach coremathematics concepts (velocity, angles,three-dimensional configurations),while girls usually experiencethese concepts for the first time in aclassroom.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR><hr></td></tr></table> <table border=0 valign="top"halign="left" cellpadding="5"><tr><td valign=top halign=leftwidth=100><img src="/images/spacer.gif" haligh=left>           </td><td valign=top><a name="Role"></a><H3>The Role Of Teachers InLearning</H3><P>In a classroom, teachers set the standard fordiscourse. Theirreliance on teaching methods that adhere to traditionalnorms andbeliefs about gender differences, and that benefit only malestudents,can create a "chilly climate" for girls (Sandler, 1982; Kramaerae&amp;Treichler, 1990).</P><P>Teachers, believing that participation isan indicator of learning,are likely to ignore females because theyparticipate less than males.Moreover, teachers are often unaware that theyare concentrating onteaching males because the process of classroominteraction isunconscious, and they respond automatically to studentdemands forattention. Males demand more attention, complain more that theyarenot receiving enough, and their teachers and female peers expectthemto get it. Analyses of classroom discussions involvingchildrenbetween the ages of 9 and 11 in different settings revealed thatboystook three times as many turns speaking (Redpath &amp; Claire, 1989),anda study of college-age students demonstrated that mendominatediscussions even more as they get older, in some classes speakingasmuch as 12 times longer than women (Krupnick, 1985).</P><P>Even whenfemales do participate in classroom talk, their approach maysuggest toteachers they have less command over the subject matterthan males. Girlsare more likely to ask questions, acknowledge thecomments of previousspeakers, and refrain from interrupting exchangesin progress. In otherwords, their classroom conduct is consonant withaccepted sex-role behaviorthat compromises women's assertiveness(Hendrick &amp; Strange, 1989). Incomparing the participation patterns ofmales and females, teachers are aptto treat females' discoursecontributions with less respect because girlsexhibit less authority.In allowing classroom discourse to parallelsex-role differences insociety, teachers unconsciously pass on negativeexpectations forgirls.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR><hr><aname="Recommendations"></a><H3>Recommendations For Encouraging MathematicsAchievement</H3><P>Since a goal of "Education 2000: An EducationStrategy" is to promotestudents' science and mathematics achievement, andsince sex equity ingeneral is a societal goal, it is crucial to remove thebarriers thatprevent females from learning advanced mathematics.</P><P>Afirst step is an ATTITUDE CHANGE. If parents believe that theirdaughterscan succeed in math and master technology, they will providethem with toysthat promote math learning readiness and will encouragethem to sustaintheir perseverance in math courses. If teachersunderstand and respectfemale learning styles, they will alterclassroom discourse to accommodategirls' participation and provide amessage to both males and females thatno single learning behavior issuperior to another.</P><P>Equallyimportant are concrete CHANGES IN TEACHING METHODS ANDCURRICULA.Cooperative learning that promotes collegiality betweenmale and femalestudents is one approach. Structuring lessons aroundthe thinking processesneeded to arrive at answers to questions ratherthan focusing solely on theanswer itself is another. Math problemscan reflect girls' experience(although they should not be limited tostereotypically female concerns,such as cooking and sewing) and canemphasize practical, real lifeapplications.</P><P>PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GIRLS TO INTERACT ASPEERSseparate from the co-ed classroom, can also strengthen theirinterestand participation in math as well as other schoolsubjects.</P><P>Finally, GENDER BIAS IN EDUCATION AND CAREER COUNSELINGSHOULD BEELIMINATED. Only when females are convinced that they can bothlearnadvanced mathematics and use it for professional success willfullintegration of math classrooms occur.</P><a href="#contents">Back tothe Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><aname="References"></a><H3>References</H3><P>Callahan, L.

Thisdigest explores factors that affect creativity inchildren and techniquesfor fostering this quality. The need to studycreativity, and thedefinition of creativity within a developmentalframework, are alsodiscussed.</P><HR><a name="Why"></a><H3>Why Study Creativity In YoungChildren?</H3><P>Just as all children are not equally intelligent, allchildren are notequally creative. But just as all children exhibitbehaviors whichevidence intelligence from birth, they also exhibitbehaviors whichevidence the potential for creativity.</P><P>Creativityis essentially a form of problem-solving. But it is aspecial type ofproblem-solving--one that involves problems for whichthere are no easyanswers: that is, problems for which popular orconventional responses donot work. Creativity involves adaptabilityand flexibility of thought.These are the same types of skills thatnumerous reports on education(e.g., the Carnegie Report, 1986) havesuggested are critical forstudents.</P><HR><a name="What"></a><H3>What IsCreativity?</H3><P>Creativity has been considered in terms of process,product or person(Barron and Harrington, 1981) and has been defined astheinterpersonal and intrapersonal process by means of whichoriginal,high quality, and genuinely significant products are developed.Indealing with young children, the focus should be on the process,i.e.,developing and generating original ideas, which is seen as thebasisof creative potential. When trying to understand this process, itishelpful to consider Guilford's (1956) differentiation betweenconvergentand divergent thought. Problems associated with convergentthought oftenhave one correct solution. But problems associated withdivergent thoughtrequire the problem-solver to generate manysolutions, a few of which willbe novel, of high quality, andworkable--hence creative.</P><P>For aproper understanding of children's creativity, one mustdistinguishcreativity from intelligence and talent. Ward (1974)expressed concernabout whether creativity in young children could bedifferentiated fromother cognitive abilities. More recent studies(for example, Moran andothers, 1983) have shown that components ofcreative potential can indeedbe distinguished from intelligence. Theterm "gifted" is often used toimply high intelligence. But Wallach(1970) has argued that intelligenceand creativity are independent ofeach other, and a highly creative childmay or may not be highlyintelligent.</P><P>Creativity goes beyondpossession and use of artistic or musicaltalent. In this context, talentrefers to the possession of a highdegree of technical skill in aspecialized area. Thus an artist mayhave wonderful technical skills, butmay not succeed in evoking theemotional response that makes the viewerfeel that a painting, forexample, is unique. It is important to keep inmind that creativity isevidenced not only in music, art, or writing, butthroughout thecurriculum, in science, social studies and otherareas.</P><P>Most measures of children's creativity have focused onideationalfluency. Ideational fluency tasks require children to generateas manyresponses as they can to a particular stimulus, as is doneinbrainstorming. Ideational fluency is generally considered to beacritical feature of the creative process. Children's responses maybeeither popular or original, with the latter considered evidenceofcreative potential. Thus when we ask four-year-olds to tell us "allthethings they can think of that are red," we find that children notonly listwagons, apples and cardinals, but also chicken pox andcoldhands.</P><P>For young children, the focus of creativity shouldremain on process:the generation of ideas. Adult acceptance of multipleideas in anon-evaluative atmosphere will help children generate more ideasormove to the next stage of self-evaluation. As children developtheability for self-evaluation, issues of quality and the generationofproducts become more important. The emphasis at this age should beonself-evaluation, for these children are exploring their abilitiestogenerate and evaluate hypotheses, and revise their ideas based onthatevaluation. Evaluation by others and criteria forgenuinelysignificant products should be used only with older adolescentsoradults.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="Affects"></a><H3>What Affects TheExpression Of Creativity?</H3><P>For young children, a non-evaluativeatmosphere appears to be acritical factor in avoiding what Treffinger(1984) labels as the"right answer fixation." Through the socializationprocess, childrenmove toward conformity during the elementary schoolyears. Thepercentage of original responses in ideational fluency tasksdropsfrom about 50% among four-year-olds to 25% during elementaryschool,then returns to 50% among college students (Moran et al., 1983). Itisimportant that children be given the opportunity to expressdivergentthought and to find more than one route to thesolution.</P><P>Rewards or incentives for children appear to interferewith thecreative process. Although rewards may not affect the numberofresponses on ideational fluency tasks, they seem to reduce thequalityof children's responses and the flexibility of their thought. Inotherwords, rewards reduce children's ability to shift from categorytocategory in their responses (Groves, Sawyers, and Moran, 1987).Indeed,any external constraint seems to reduce this flexibility.Other studieshave shown that structured materials, especially whencombined withstructured instructions, reduce flexibility infour-year-old children(Moran, Sawyers, and Moore, in press). In onecase, structured instructionsconsisted only in the demonstration ofhow to put together a model.Teachers need to remember that thestructure of children's responses isvery subtle. Research suggeststhat children who appear to be creative areoften involved inimaginative play, and are motivated by internal factorsrather thanexternal factors, such as rewards and incentives.</P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="Adults"></a><H3>How Can AdultsEncourage Creativity?</H3><UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI> Provide an environmentthat allows the child to explore and play	without unduerestraints.<BR><BR>	<LI> Adapt to children's ideas rather than trying tostructure the	child's ideas to fit the adult's.<BR><BR>	<LI> Acceptunusual ideas from children by suspending judgement of	children'sdivergent problem-solving.<BR><BR>	<LI> Use creative problem-solving inall parts of the curriculum.

Adults can also try toensure that children have theopportunity and confidence to takerisks, challenge assumptions, and seethings in a new way.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR></td></tr></table> <table border=0 valign="top"halign="left" cellpadding="5"><tr><td valign=top halign=leftwidth=100><img src="/images/spacer.gif" haligh=left>           </td><td valign=top><hr><a name="Information"></a><H3>For MoreInformation</H3><P>Barron, Frank and David M.

But how doyou as a parent go about findingthe information you need to do a goodjob at such an important task? Whichorganizations will be the mosthelpful? What resources are available tohelp you fulfill thisimportant responsibility? Here is a quick digest ofideas andresources to get you started.</P><a name="Visit"></a><H3>VisitYour Local Library</H3><P>First of all, your local public library is oneof your best--and leastexpensive--resources. Libraries, even small ones,have shelves ofbooks for parents and children. Consult a librarian if youdo not findthe materials you're looking for, or aren't sure what'savailable. Thelibrarian may be willing to order some of the resourceslisted in thisDigest or tell you how to obtain them through inter-libraryloan. Yourschool library and nearby college library are other possiblesourcesof information.</P><a name="Reading"></a><H3>Reading Aloud AndModeling Reading</H3><P>Reading aloud to your children, and letting themsee you reading, aretwo of the best ways to help them on the road toliteracy. It's nevertoo early to start! Two particularly useful books,which have beenpopular for many years and are probably available in yourlocallibrary, are "The New Read-Aloud Handbook," by Jim Trelease (2ndrev.ed., 1989, Penguin Books) and "A Parent's Guide toChildren'sReading," by Nancy Larrick (5th ed., 1982, BantamBooks).</P><P>As Barbara Bush wrote recently, "Above all, children loveto be readto. It is a special time for them to be close to the grown-upswhocare for them, and a wonderful way to feel loved." (Bush,1993)</P><P>Many books for both children and adults are available ina"read-along" format using audio cassettes. These are often availableinyour public library and may be especially useful in the car or whenyou andyour child would like to listen together to a tape whilefollowing along inthe book.</P><a name="Playing"></a><H3>Playing With YourChildren</H3><P>Small children generally learn best while playing,rather than bybeing "instructed." Knowing this, you can involve your childin lotsof day-to-day activities and conversations that will helpdevelopher/his literacy. You can talk to the child while playing,aboutwhatever is of interest to you both. Nursery rhymes and songs arefunto learn and say or sing together.</P><P>Ordinary daily activitiescan also be an occasion for learning. Forexample, recognizing commercialsigns and logos while out walking ordriving is one of the first steps inlearning to read. A simple tripto the grocery store is more fun if youtalk with your child about thethings you're seeing and doing when he'slittle, about colors andshapes; later on, about the many places from whichgrocery items come;when he's older, about box sizes and unit costs and thenutritionalvalue of items in the store.</P><a href="#contents">Back tothe Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><aname="Listening"></a><H3>Listening To Your Children Read</H3><P>Once achild learns to read, she needs lots of practice. The more thebetter! Theold saying about "practice makes perfect" applies toreading as well as tomost other activities. If a child has frequentopportunities to read aloudto a willing listener--often a parent orgrand-parent or a sibling--she ismore likely to become a fluentreader. Most children enjoy reading everyother page with anadult--you read the first page, she reads the second,and so forth.With an older child, you might each read a chapter.</P><P>You maywant to help your child get "over the hump" of starting a newbook byoffering to read the first few chapters aloud at bedtime (oralternatepages with your child). When you finish, you may hear, "Doyou mind if Iread the next chapter by myself before I go to sleep?"and you will knowyou have succeeded in your endeavor.</p> <a href="#contents">Back to the Tableof Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="Conversations"></a><H3>Having BookConversations With Your Child</H3><P>Sharing may take place in manyways--book conversations, journals,drawing, and improvisational drama.Participants in the ParentsSharing Books program developed by the FamilyLiteracy Center atIndiana University program have found that the amount ofreading bychildren in the program increases markedly. They also report, asanadded benefit, a dramatic improvement in family communication.Parentsmay be interested in a book describing this program. The bookiscalled "Connect! How to Get Your Kids to Talk to You." It isavailablefrom the Family Literacy Center for $14.95.</P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><aname="Helping"></a><H3>Helping Your Children Write</H3><P>With alittle encouragement, your children's reading and writingdevelopment willproceed on parallel tracks. Even a very young childwho sees the adults inher life writing letters and grocery lists andtelephone messages will wantto try writing also (Baghban, 1989). Atfirst, to an adult, the effortslook like scribbles, but before longyour child will be trying tocommunicate with pictures and words.Encourage her efforts. Before long,sending letters and stories tograndparents or to some other relative canbe a reason for writing.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR></td></tr></table> <table border=0 valign="top"halign="left" cellpadding="5"><tr><td valign=top halign=leftwidth=100><img src="/images/spacer.gif" haligh=left>           </td><td valign=top><hr><a name="Materials"></a><H3>Materials ForParents--A Sampling</H3><P>"Little Beginnings: Starting Your Child on aLifetime of Learning.

<P>    WASHINGTON, Dec. 30, 1996 -- The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) today issued a final regulation and two proposed
regulations in its continuing effort to preserve the benefits of air bags,
while minimizing their danger to children and at-risk adults.</P>

<P>    The two proposed regulations include plans for the depowering of air bags
and procedures for deactivation of air bags in certain circumstances.  In a
continuation of the administration's comprehensive approach, the final rule
adopted today continues the automakers' option of installing cut-off switches
in vehicles without a rear seat for children.  There will be a 30-day comment
period, shortened to expedite completion, for the proposals before the
issuance of final rules.</P>

<P>    "By the end of this year, air bags will have saved more than 1,700 lives,
but we can and will do more to minimize their potential hazards.  These
proposals are the next step in the rapid execution of our comprehensive
strategy to address the air bag issues of today and enhance car safety for the
future, culminating in the smart systems which will appear in model year
1999," said NHTSA Administrator Ricardo Martinez, M.D.</P>

<P>    Following is a summary of the regulatory actions announced today by NHTSA:</P>

  <ul>
  
    <li> Extended availability of switches.  A final rule extends the agency's
         existing policy of permitting manufacturers to install manual cut-off
         switches in vehicles without a back seat, or with a back seat that is
         too small to install a child safety seat.  A cut-off switch enables
         the driver of a pickup truck, for example, to disable the passenger
         side air bag when a child is in the front seat, and turn it back on
         for an adult passenger. </p>

     <li>   Depowering for safety.  A notice of proposed rulemaking that would
         authorize manufacturers to depower air bags temporarily an average of
         20-35 percent, thereby reducing the deployment force.  This proposal
         would be in place until smart air bag technology is phased into new
         motor vehicles.  NHTSA believes that this level of depowering will
         reduce the incidence of injury and improve the performance of air
         bags for children, small stature adults and other belted occupants,
         while still providing significant protection for unbelted occupants.
         NHTSA is seeking comments on its proposed changes to the federal
         standards and it expects them to be implemented before the start of
         model year 1998.</p>

     <li>   Deactivation for special cases.  A notice of proposed rulemaking
         would permit dealers and repair shops to deactivate the air bags of
         any owner who requests it.  As opposed to the current policy of
         case-by-case approval by NHTSA, the proposal is intended to provide
         families who need to transport infants in the front seat, individuals
         with certain medical conditions, and others who are concerned about
         potential air bag dangers, with an expedited legal avenue to turn
         them off.  Existing federal law prohibits dealers from making any
         safety equipment inoperative.  If this proposal becomes final,
         automobile dealers and repair shops will be asked to help their
         customers make informed decisions by providing them with NHTSA
         guidance on the pros and cons of deactivating the air bag system.
         The agency expects that very few will need to take this extreme
         action, and those who do will be made aware of the risks involved.
         The dealers and repair shops will be permitted to deactivate the air
         bags upon the written authorization of their customer.  They must
         also install labels indicating that air bags have been disabled.</p>
         
      </ul>   

<P>    Today's action is part of a multi-pronged strategy including a labeling
proposal published in November and a forthcoming proposal that will mandate
"smart" air bags starting in Model Year 1999, Dr. Martinez added.</P>

<P>    "It is important to add that children age 12 and under should always ride
in the back seat, buckled up, and away from the air bag.  Regulatory actions
will make tomorrow's air bags safer for children, but too many are at risk in
the interim if parents do not insist children ride in the back seat," Dr.
Martinez said.</P>

<P>    NHTSA officials noted that overall, air bags are working well and are
responsible for an 11 percent reduction in driver fatalities in passenger
cars, including a 30 percent reduction in fatalities in head-on crashes.</P>

<P>    Consumers who have questions or concerns about air bags should contact the
agency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at:  800-424-9393.  For up-to-date
information on air bag issues, contact NHTSA's World Wide Web site at:

rulemaking announced today should be sent by Feb. 5, 1997 to NHTSA, Technical
Reference Division, Docket Numbers 74-14-107, 74-14-108, 74-14-109, 400

<P>EACH YEAR, MORE CHILDREN DIE IN HOME ACCIDENTS THAN FROM ALL
CHILDHOOD DISEASES COMBINED.  WATCH YOUR CHILDREN AS THEY PLAY -
NOTHING CAN SUBSTITUTE FOR CAREFUL SUPERVISION.</P>

<P><B>HOUSEHOLD DANGERS</B></P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Know where the "danger" items are- medicines, toxic
     bleaches, oven and drain cleaners, paint solvents, polishes,
     and waxes.  Look for items packaged in CHILD-RESISTANT
     containers.  Don't leave them under a sink or in plain view
     in a garage - lock them away in a secure place, out of your
     child's sight and reach.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Keep all thin plastic wrapping materials, such as dry
     cleaning, produce, or trash bags away from children.  NEVER
     USE THIN PLASTIC MATERIAL TO COVER MATTRESSES OR PILLOWS -
     the plastic film can cling to a child's face causing
     suffocation.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Guard against electrical shocks.  Cover unused outlets with
     safety caps.  DISCONNECT electric rollers or hairdryers when
     not in use; some children have been electrocuted when
     hairdryers that were left plugged-in fell into bathroom
     sinks or tubs.<BR><BR>

<LI>  Keep children away from open windows to prevent falls.
     Don't depend on screens to keep the child from falling out
     of the window.  They are designed to keep insects out, not
     children in.  Avoid placing furniture near windows to keep
     children from climbing to a window seat or sill.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P><B>NURSERY EQUIPMENT</B></P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>    Many nursery products have a long life and may be stored in
     anticipation of future use.  When choosing USED or NEW
     nursery equipment, check for sturdy construction and
     stability.  Avoid exposed screws, bolts, or fasteners with
     sharp edges or points; avoid scissor-like mechanisms which
     could crush fingers; and avoid cutout designs that could
     entrap a child's head.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Safety straps on high chairs and strollers are a must.  Look
     for straps that are easy to fasten and unfasten so that you
     will be sure to use them properly each time.<BR><BR>

<LI>    Mesh playpens and portable cribs SHOULD NEVER BE USED WITH A
     SIDE LEFT DOWN.  They can pose a serious hazard to newborns
     and infants because the mesh forms a loose pocket into which
     an infant can roll and suffocate.<BR><BR>



<LI>    Use baby walkers only on smooth surfaces.  Edges of carpets,
     throw rugs, or raised thresholds can cause a walker to tip
     over.  Remove throw rugs when a walker is in use, and block
     the tops of stairways.  Children have fallen down stairs in
     walkers.<BR><BR>

<LI>   If cribs or playpens are placed near a window, make sure
     there are no drapery or venetian blind cords hanging within
     your baby's reach.  Don't hang objects with strings or
     elastics (toys or laundry bags, for example) around cribs or
     playpens where your child might become entangled and choke
     to death.<BR><BR>

<LI>    When children begin to climb and explore, they can become
     caught in small or narrow openings.  Some have been
     strangled when they caught their heads or necks in the open
     "V" shapes atop expandable wooden gates or enclosures, or in
     decorative cutouts in cribs.<BR><BR>

<LI>   NEVER TIE PACIFIERS OR OTHER ITEMS AROUND YOUR BABY'S NECK.
     Cords and ribbons can become tightly twisted, or can catch
     on crib cornerposts or other protrusions, causing
     strangulation.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P><B>TOYS, TOY CHESTS AND LABELING
</B></P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>    Keep small objects out of your child's reach.  Tiny toys,
     and toys with small, removable parts can be swallowed or
     become lodged in a child's windpipe, ears, or nose.  Check
     to see that toys have not broken or come apart at the seams,
     exposing small pellets that might be swallowed or inhaled.
     Even such common items as coins, pins, buttons, or small
     batteries can choke a child.<BR><BR>

<LI>   When choosing toys, look for labels that give age
     recommendations such as "Recommended for Children Tree to
     Five Years Old."  Some toys or games which are safe for
     older children may contain small parts which are hazardous
     in a younger child's hands.<BR><BR>

<LI>   If a toy chest, trunk or other container for storing toys
     has a freefalling lid, REMOVE THE LID.  A lid can drop on a
     child's head or neck, and some children have been killed or
     seriously injured.  Look for a chest which has supports to
     hold the lid open an any position, or choose one with
     sliding panels or a lightweight, removable lid.

<P>    CHICAGO, Dec. 12, 1996 -- The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
today stated that any effective television ratings system should be content
based to offer parents guidance on a program's level of sex, violence and
language.  The action is in response to recent media reports on the television
industry's efforts to institute a ratings system that labels programs by age
groups, similar to the current ratings system by the movie industry.</P>

<P>    The AAP says that content-based systems, such as those developed by the
Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC) and the cable system, are
effective in helping parents make informed decisions about program selections.
The RSAC guidelines address sex, violence and language by utilizing a symbol
for each category.  Parents use symbols to gauge whether a program is
appropriate for their children.  These systems should be used as a benchmark
in judging any ratings because they are objective and informative without
being judgmental.</P>

<P>    The AAP has long recommended that parents should monitor the content of
what their children see on television in policy statements entitled "Media
Violence;" "Sexuality, Contraception and the Media;" and "Children,
Adolescents and Television."  The AAP says that next to the family, television
is the most important influence on child development and behavior in our
society.  As an example, AAP policies cite the following statistics:</P>

<ul>

    <li> By age 18, the average American teenager will have spent more time
watching television than learning in the classroom. </p>

    <li> American teenagers see an estimated 14,000 sexual references and
innuendoes per year on television, yet only 150 references deal with sexual
responsibility, abstinence or contraception.</p>

    <li> The level of violence during Saturday morning cartoons is higher than
the level of violence during prime time.  There are three to five violent acts
per hour in prime time vs. 20 to 25 acts per hour on Saturday morning.
</p>
</ul>

<P>    To counter these media messages, parents need to teach children to be
"media literate" and to differentiate between fantasy and reality.  The AAP
encourages all parents to talk with their child's pediatrician about ways to
respond to the television messages that children receive in the home.</P>

<P>    For a single free copy of a brochure on television, parents may send a
self-addressed, stamped business size envelope to: American Academy of
Pediatrics, Dept. C: Television &amp; the Family, PO Box 927, Elk Grove Village,
IL 60009-0927.</P>

<P>    The American Academy of Pediatrics is an organization of
51,000 pediatricians dedicated to the health, safety and well-being of
infants, children, adolescents and young adults.</P>

<P>    SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 17, 1996 -- Playing is an important part of a
child's development, and toys can help stimulate creative play. But the
American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) cautions parents to select toys
carefully this holiday season. Toys are responsible for thousands of eye
injuries each year.</P>

<P>    The following are AAO tips for preventing toy-related eye injuries:</P>

<ul>

   <li><B> Avoid Dangerous Toys.</B> Do not purchase shooting toys or toys that include
detachable parts that can fly into an eye. BB guns, slingshots, and water guns
are just some examples. Never buy hobby kits, such as chemistry sets, for any
child younger than 12 years of age. </p>
      <li> <B> Inspect for Durability.</B> Toys for young children should not contain sharp
points or edges and should be able to withstand continual impact.</p>
       <li> <B>Look at the label.</B> Toys for children should match a child's abilities.
Manufacturer instructions provide information on suggested age level for use.
The symbol, ASTM, indicates that the product meets the national safety
standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials.</p>
       <li>  <B>Ensure Proper Storage.</B> Teach children to store toys effectively when
they are not in use, so children do not trip and fall over a toy.</p>
       <li> <B> Perform Routine Inspections.</B> Maintain toys by checking them periodically
for broken and/or damaged parts.

</ul>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) advises owners
of children's tubular metal bunk beds to inspect the beds for
metal or weld cracks which may lead to collapse and serious
injury. The bunk beds may have been welded poorly or have
inadequate material thickness around the mattress support fins,
which connect to the side rails.</P>

<P>The Commission is aware of numerous incidents in which the bunk
beds collapsed during use. Many of the incidents occurred on the
currently popular twin-size on top/full-size on bottom bunk beds.
Injuries reported include broken bones, lacerations, bruises, and
sprains.</P>

<P>These bunk beds are often imported from Malaysia, Taiwan, and
Mexico. They are distributed in the United States by a large
number of importers and retailers and sold to consumers
nationwide. The beds are constructed of tubular metal and are
usually painted with high gloss red, white, blue, or black paint.
They have been sold for approximately $150 to $250 each. The beds
frequently have no identifying markings or manufacturer labels.</P>

<P>To help avoid bunk bed collapse, CPSC urges consumers to inspect
all eight mattress support fin tabs and pockets for breaks or
cracks in the metal and welds. The fin tabs are inserted into a
pocket located near each of the bed's eight corners. Consumers
should stop using damaged beds as bunks and put both beds on the
floor until CPSC completes its investigation. Collapsing
incidents should be reported to CPSC by calling toll-free
1-800-638-2772. The CPSC is conducting follow-up investigations
of several consumer reports of bunk bed collapse.</P>

<P>Although most of the reported collapsing incidents occurred with
the currently popular twin-size top bunk and full-size bottom
bunk beds, the twin/twin size bunk beds may also be affected and
should be closely examined as well. The Commission adds that not
all children's metal bunk beds present this problem. This alert
is being issued as a precautionary measure until specific brands
and models of bunk beds can be identified.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Levi Strauss &amp;Co. of
San Francisco, Calif., is voluntarily recalling about 3,000
Little Levi's Koveralls and Shortalls. The snap fasteners on
the inside legs of these garments may separate, creating a
potential choking risk to children.</P>

<P>     CPSC and Levi Strauss are not aware of any injuries
involving these garments. This recall is being conducted to
prevent the possibility of injury.</P>

<P>     The recalled Little Levi's  brand Koveralls and
Shortalls styled for boys in sizes 12 to 24 months and 2T to
4T were all sold in indigo denim with product codes:
29028-2891 and 22028-2891 (Koveralls) and 22020-2891 and
29020-2891 (Shortalls). Koveralls is a youth version of
traditional adult overalls and Shortalls is a short pant
length version.</P>

<P>     Levi Strauss is also recalling infant sizes 12 to 24
months of its Levi's brand Girlswear Koveralls and Shortalls
with product codes:  38806-0817 and 38806-0881 (Koveralls)
and 39867-0881, 39867-0817, and 39867-9281 (Shortalls). The
girls garments were sold in stonebleach denim, pink twill,
or pink check fabric with an elastic back. The product codes
are located on the back of the care label sewn in an inside
seam of each garment.</P>

<P>     Retail stores sold the garments nationwide beginning in
November 1996.</P>

<P>     Consumers should immediately stop using these garments
and return them to the store where purchased for a full
refund. Consumers with questions about the recall may call
Levi Strauss &amp;Co. at 1-(800)USA-LEVI, or write to the
company at: Levi's Plaza, P.O. Box 7215, San Francisco,
Calif.  94120.</P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public
from the unreasonable risk of injury or death from 15,000 types
of consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction.  To report 
a dangerous product or a product-related injury and for 
information on CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline
at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270.  
To order a press release through fax-on-demand, call
(301) 504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release
number.  Consumers can obtain this release and recall information via
Internet gopher services at cpsc.gov or report product hazards to

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Mattel, Inc. today
announced that Mattel will attach warning labels to all Cabbage Patch
Snacktime Kids dolls following reports of children getting their hair and
fingers caught in the doll's mouth.</P>

<P>"Mattel will put labels on all the dolls still on store shelves and on all
future production," according to CPSC Chairman Ann Brown. "The information
will warn that long hair and fingers can get caught in the doll's mouth,
and will tell consumers that the doll's chewing action can be stopped
immediately by removing the backpack.  The doll will not operate
without the backpack in place."</P>

<P>Brown added that the CPSC is continuing to investigate possible safety
risks posed by the doll.  Mattel is pursuing its own investigation.</P>

<P>Glen Bozarth, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications for Mattel
said: "This issue is of great concern to us and we are taking actions to
address it immediately."</P>

<P>The CPSC and Mattel, Inc. are aware of 35 incidents where a child's hair
or finger was caught in the mouths of these dolls.  No serious injuries
have been reported. </P>

<P>Mattel has distributed 700,000 Snacktime Kids since August 1996. Mattel
will also provide the safety information and warnings to consumers who
call 1-800-524-TOYS.  The media contact for Mattel is Lisa McKendall,
310-252-4592.</P>

<P>For safety information about these dolls, or to register a complaint,
consumers can call the CPSC Hotline at 1-800-638-2772.  </P>

<td valign=top>

<p> Many parents believe that they take adequate precautions in protecting their young child from the potentially deadly E. Coli bacteria.  We've heard that we shouldn't feed our children undercooked hamburger.  But did you know that unpasteurized apple juice and other fruits and vegetables can also carry this deadly bacteria? Do you know that the symptoms of an E. Coli infection are very similar to other problems and that it is very difficult to detect and diagnose? And that it can lead to a complication that is the leading cause of kidney failure in young children?</p>

<p>You think such  problems can never happen to you or to someone you know.   Anna, a child of a good friend of ours, was recently stricken by E. Coli. This frightening episode taught us how insidious this bacteria is and how devastating it can be to a young child.  As we tried to learn about what was happening to Anna, we found how much we as parents do not know about preventing and identifying E.Coli infections. We realized that there is a great need to increase awareness, so we started this area.</p>

<a name="goals"></a>
<h4>Our Goals</h4>

<p>We have three specific goals for this area that will help all parents of young children. We want to -
	<ul>
	<li> Reduce the risk of E.Coli infections in our own children
	<li> Know what to do if we believe our child is infected with E.Coli
	<li> Help prevent these problems in the future and improve the public systems that track these infections
	</ul>
	
<p>We will continue to develop and expand this area in the coming weeks to not only help parents become better educated, but in the long run, to better protect our children. As usual, we await your comments, suggestions and feedback. Thank you for visiting. </p>

<a name="Key"></a>
<h3>What We Learned about E. Coli Infections </h3>

<p> In talking with those involved in the recent outbreak and in reading the literature, we've learned that:
<ul>
<li>While a common source of E. Coli infections is undercooked hamburger, the bacteria can survive in other products - unpasteurized dairy and apple juice products for example.  Parents are not typically aware of how many different types of food products can be easily contaminated. We need to learn what everyday things we can  do to reduce the risk of E. Coli infections.</p>
<li>An E.Coli infection hurts young children and elderly people the most. When it leads to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), it can be fatal and is the leading cause of renal failure in young children.</p>
<li>The symptoms of this infection, such as stomach cramps and diarrhea, are similar to other problems.  Not all medical professionals think of E.Coli infections early on, since this infection is not common. Parents need to familiarize themselves with the symptoms and learn what questions to ask their medical professionals.</p>
<li>Symptoms can manifest themselves from around 1 to 9 days after ingestion of contaminated food. So you may have no idea what caused the infection, or if you do, any food samples required for testing may be long gone. </p>
<li>It is very difficult to accurately diagnose an E.Coli infection. However, it can quickly turn into HUS. So, what seems to be "just a sick child", can become a major medical emergency requiring blood transfusions and dialysis. Medical professionals may not be familiar with the diagnosis or treatments. </p>
<li> Governmental tracking of these infection is required to accurately pinpoint the source of contamination. But the medical, governmental and testing systems are not presently adequate to track these infections in a timely manner to quickly help those who are infected. </p>
</uL>
<P>This is just a sample of the key points you'll find in the following articles, stories and websites. We suggest that you read them, familiarize yourself with the prevention methods, the symptoms and treatments.</P>

<p>3 year old Anna was stricken with an E. Coli infection in mid October of this year. Here, her mother, Laurie tells about this harrowing experience, and what the family learned as the infection led to Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). HUS is a potentially deadly complication that is the leading cause of kidney failure in young children.  It is believed that Anna contracted the infection from drinking a popular brand of unpasteurized apple juice.  When you read this story,  you'll realize how easily it could have been your child. </p>

<h3>What's New </h3>

<ul>

<li><A href="/kidsource/content2/equal_math_girls.html"> Equal Mathematics Education for Female Students </a>

<P>Research over the last decade has shown that males and females have different classroom experiences because they approach learning differently and because teachers tend to treat them differently. As girls progress through school, they are less likely to continue their math education, either taking more rudimentary courses or dropping the subject altogether.  This article identifies the specific
treatment of female students that inhibits their ability to successfully learn math and steps to remove the barriers that prevent females from learning advanced mathematics.</P>

<li><A href="/kidsource/content2/creativity_in_kids.html"> Creativity in Young Children  </a>

<P>The precursors of adult creativity are clearly evident in young children.  Adults can encourage creativity by emphasizing the generation and expression of ideas in a non-evaluative framework and by concentrating on both divergent and convergent thinking. Adults can also try to ensure that children have the opportunity and confidence to take risks, challenge assumptions, and see things in a new way.</P>


<li><A href="/kidsource/content2/children's_literacy.html">
 Children's Literacy Development: Suggestions for Parent Involvement  </a>

<P>Parents are a child's first and most influential teachers! Free and inexpensive resources are available to help you fulfill the important responsibility of raising a literate child. This article gives a quick digest of ideas and resources to get you started.</P>

<img src="/images/BNR-ComputingEDGE.gif" alt = "EDGE, Equipment Donation and Grants to Education" height=110 width=400> </H1>
</center>
<h2> What's New </h2>
<ul>
<li>We have a new section - equipment that's available for donation!
<li>Check out each equipment area to see the latest requests!
<li>Read about our <a href="/kidsource/pages/donation.news.html">latest donation! </a> 

</ul>

<h2> Equipment Donations and Grants to Education </h2>


<P> Welcome!  Computing EDGE helps match needy schools with excess, unused or obsolete computer equipment.  It's a free public service that matches the technology needs of schools with computer equipment and technology of individuals and corporations.  This is a brand new program and the listings are growing daily!  
<br>
<br>
Below, you'll find listings by school of what types of computer equipment they would like to have.  These schools have submitted their specific requests and have described briefly why the equipment is needed and how it will be used.   
<br>
<br>
If you are an educator and wish to submit a listing, check out the details below.  If you have equipment you wish to donate to a needy school, then jump to the equipment listings! 
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Equipment Available for Donation </h2>

<blockquote>
<P> We are a small independent school in Berkeley, CA with several Apple 
IIE's, disk drives, monitors (black and white and color), printers, 
and lots of software.  We are looking for a local target to donate 
this equipment to avoid any shipping charges.  </P>

<P>Contact: Lee Tempkin at <a href="mailto:berk6@sirius.com">  berk6@sirius.com </a></P>
</blockquote>

<hr>


<H2> Equipment Listing </h2>
<p>
The following equipment listings are sorted by computer categories.  If a particular school is in need of equipment that spans different categories, the listing is repeated in each category.  Requests for needed computers have been coming in from around the world and the international requests are listed within the appropriate computer category.
 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/Mac.html">Macintosh </A>
<li>
<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/AppleII.html">Apple II </A>
<li>
<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/PC.html">PC-Compatibles (DOS/Windows) </A>
<li>
<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/Other.html">Other Equipment </A>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2> Tax Benefits </h2>
Considering donating computer equipment to a school as part of the EDGE program, but aren't sure of the <a href="/kidsource/content/taxes.html">tax regulations and procedures </a>?  Check out an article written for KidSource OnLine by Thomas Kearns, a CPA and tax accountant.
<hr>
<H2>Here's how EDGE works</H2>      
<p> If you are an educator, school or teacher: <p>
<OL>
<li>Send mail to <a href ="mailto:support@kidsource.com">support@kidsource.com.</a> outlining what you need.  Helpful details to include:
<UL>
<li>Type of computer (i.e. Mac, Apple II, Windows, DOS)
<li>Specific needs (i.e. software, CD-ROM drive, sound card)
<li>Who will use it or why it's needed (be creative here!) 
<li>Contact information (i.e. name, title, school-name, e-mail address or phone-number)
</UL>
<li>Wait for someone to call.....
<li>Send mail to me letting me know that the request has been filled.  
</OL>

<p>If you wish to donate equipment: <p>
<OL>
<li>Review the above list of needs
<li>Contact the school or educator directly using the above information
<li>Work out the details with them
<li>Let me know at  <a href ="mailto:EDGE@kidsource.com">EDGE@kidsource.com.</a> that it worked! 
</OL>
<hr>
<h2> The details </h2>
<p> Here's what I do:<OL>
<li>The listings will be posted as received. No editing or verification will be done
<li>They will be sorted by category to make it easier for people looking to donate specific equipment.
<li>The listings will remain posted until they are filled. 
<li>Listings will be updated frequently.  Posting dates will be used.    
</OL>
<p> 
<hr>
<H3>The necessary legal caveats </H3>
<p> The parties involved in the transaction are responsible for verifying or determining the veracity of the request, the working condition of the equipment and the logistics of the transaction (what's included, how is it sent, who pays for shipping, etc.).  This web site is only providing a space to match up interested parties.  It and all parties involved directly or indirectly do not take responsibility for validating the request, the working condition of the equipment and establishing the logistics of the transaction. 

<h3> Thanks </h3>
<p> Thanks to Laurie Girand of <a href ="mailto:laurie@beyondmarketing.com">Beyond Marketing Strategies </a> for this idea! </p>

<H3>Making the Most of Math Software</H3>

<p>Chances are, your kids did some reading over the holidays.  Listened to cherished tales that you read aloud.  Or perhaps got a gift of some storybook software.  But did they do any math?</p>

 <p>Somehow it's harder to make math a source of family fun the way reading can be!</p>

But take heart:  there's an increasing number of inventive mathematics programs that are both educationally strong and irresistible to kids.  You'll find many of them reviewed in a lively, authoritative resource - <EM>The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids</EM> - that combines the expertise of an incredible museum plus the insights of real-life parents and kids like yours.  And as a service to you, the authors of the Guide have created some special advice about math software for KidSource OnLine: 

<ul>
<li><a href="/kidsource/software/greattips.html">Great Tips for Choosing Math Software</a>
<li><a href="/kidsource/software/mathfun.html">Plus "Non-Math" Programs with Terrific Math Challenges</a>
<li><a href="/kidsource/software/bestmathlist.html">The Best Math Programs</a>

<P>Learning to read begins well before the first day of school.  When Ron
and Donna tell nursery rhymes to their baby, Mia,  they are beginning
to teach Mia to read.  They are helping her to hear the similarities
and differences in the sounds of words. She will begin to manipulate
and understand sounds in spoken language, and she will practice this
understanding by making up rhymes and new words of her own.   She will
learn the names of the letters and she will learn the different sounds
each letter represents.  As she gets a little older, Ron and Donna
will teach her to write letters and numbers that she will already
recognize by their shapes. Finally, she will associate the letters of
the alphabet with the sounds of the words she uses when she speaks.
At this point, she is on her way to learning to read!</P>

<P>When she tries to read books with her parents, at school, and on her
own, Mia will learn how to learn new words by sounding them out.  With
more practice, she will begin to recognize familiar words easily and
quickly, and she will know the patterns of spelling that appear in
words and the patterns of words as they appear in sentences. She will
be able to pay attention not just to the letters and words, but to the
meanings they represent.  Ultimately, Mia will be able to think about
the meaning of the text as she reads.   </P>

<HR>

<a name="Phonological"></a>
<H3>Where Does Phonological Awareness Fit Into This Process? </H3>



<P>Key to the process of learning to read is Mia's ability to identify
the different sounds that make words  and to associate these sounds
with written words.  In order to learn to read, Mia must be aware of
phonemes.  A phoneme is the smallest functional unit of sound.  For
example, the word cat contains three distinctly different sounds.
There are 44 phonemes in the English language, including letter
combinations such as /th/.  </P>

<P>In addition to identifying these sounds, Mia must also be able to
manipulate them.  Word play involving segmenting words into their
constituent sounds, rhyming words, and blending sounds to make words
is also essential to the reading process.  The ability to identify and
manipulate the sounds of language is called phonological awareness.
Adams (1990) described five levels of phonological awareness ranging
from an awareness of rhyme to being able to switch or substitute the
components in a word.  While phonological awareness affects early
reading ability, the ability to read also increases phonological
awareness (Smith, Simmons, &amp; Kameenui, 1995).   </P>

<P>Many children with learning disabilities have deficiencies in their
ability to process phonological information.  Thus, they do not
readily learn how to relate letters of the alphabet to the sounds of
language (Lyon, 1995).  For all students, the processes of
phonological awareness, including phonemic awareness, must be
explicitly taught. </P>

<P>Children from culturally diverse backgrounds may have particular
difficulties with phonological awareness.  Exposure to language at
home, exposure to reading at an early age, and dialect all affect the
ability of children to understand the phonological distinctions on
which the English language is built. Teachers must apply sensitive
effort and use a variety of  techniques to help children learn these
skills when standard English is not spoken at home (Lyon, 1994). </P>

<HR>

<a name="Awareness"></a>
<H3>How Is Phonological Awareness Taught?  </H3>



<P>To teach phonological awareness,  begin by demonstrating the
relationships of parts to wholes.  Then model and demonstrate how to
segment short sentences into individual words, showing how the
sentence is made up of words.  Use chips or other manipulatives to
represent the number of words in the sentence. Once the students
understand part-whole relationships at the sentence level,  move on to
the word level, introducing multisyllable words for segmentation into
syllables.  Finally, move to phoneme tasks by  modeling a specific
sound and asking the students to produce that sound both in isolation
and in a variety of words and syllables.</P>

<P>It is best to begin with easier words and then move on to more
difficult ones.  Five characteristics make a word easier or more
difficult (Kameenui, 1995):</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>	The size of the phonological unit (e.g., it is easier to break

sentences into words and words into syllables than to break syllables
into phonemes).

<LI>	The number of phonemes in the word (e.g., it is easier to
break phonemically short words such as no, see and cap than snort,
sleep or scrap).

<LI>	Phoneme position in words (e.g., initial consonants are easier
than final consonants and middle consonants are most difficult).

<LI>	Phonological properties of words (e.g., continuant such as
/s/ and /m/ are easier than very brief sounds such as /t/).

<LI>	Phonological awareness challenges. (e.g., rhyming and initial
phoneme identification are easier than blending and segmenting.)
</OL>

<P>Examples of phonological awareness tasks include phoneme deletion
("What word would be left if the /k/ sound were taken away from
cat?");  Word to word matching ("Do pen and pipe begin with the same
sound?"); Blending ("What word would we have if we blended these
sounds together: /m/ /o/ /p/?"); phoneme segmentation ("What sounds do
you hear in the word hot?"); phoneme counting ("How many sounds do you
hear in the word cake?"); and rhyming ("Tell me all of the words that
you know that rhyme with the word cat?") (Stanovich, 1994).   </P>

<P>Beginning readers require more direct instructional support from
teachers in the early stages of teaching.  This is illustrated in the
following example:  The teacher models the sound or the strategy for
making the sound, and has the children use the strategy to produce the
sound.  It is very important that the teacher model the correct
sounds.  This is done using several examples for each dimension and
level of difficulty.  The children are prompted to use the strategy
during guided practice and more difficult examples are introduced.  A
sequence and schedule of opportunities for children to apply and
develop facility with sounds should be tailored to each child's needs,
and should be given top priority.  Opportunities to engage in
phonological awareness activities should be plentiful, frequent, and
fun (Kameenui, 1995). </P>

<P>
    According to the CDC, the first flu outbreak has hit -- with 19 states
reporting cases of influenza.  Close to 50% of kids will get the flu or flu-
like symptoms this winter.
</P>

<P>
    Dr. Paula Elbirt-Bender, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Mount Sinai
School of Medicine, provides "flu recovery tips" for parents on how to
detect the flu in kids, how to treat it and when to notify the doctor.

        <B> What Every Parent Should Know About Dehydration and the Flu</B>
</P>

	
<P>
 Keeping Kids Out of Danger, Treating the Flu and Notifying the Doctor 
</P>

<UL>
    <LI> An average of 48% of children have flu or flu-like symptoms each
winter.<SUP>(1)</SUP><BR><BR>

    <LI> Studies show that during a flu epidemic, illness occurs first and most
frequently among school-age children (ages 5-18) as compared with other age
groups.<SUP>(2)</SUP><BR><BR>

    <LI> Cold and flu related diarrhea and vomiting is a significant cause of
dehydration in children under 6 years of age.<BR><BR>

    <LI> Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluid than it is able to
take in.  This is often accompanied by an imbalance of body salts such as
potassium or sodium.<BR><BR>

    <LI> Signs of dehydration include: dry mouth, no tears when crying,
decreased urination, lethargy and skin that is less elastic than usual.  In
infants, failure to produce a wet diaper after 8 hours or a sunken soft spot
on the top of the head are additional signs of dehydration.<BR><BR>

    <LI> Dehydration is a particular threat to infants and small children, whose
loss of fluids is greater in proportion to their body weight than older
children.  Also, they are unable to communicate their lack of fluids
effectively.<BR><BR>

    <LI> Flu season officially begins in October and runs through the following
April.<BR><BR>

    <LI> Flu viruses are divided into three types - A, B and C. The viruses
change from year to year, resulting in strains that have different symptoms
each year.  As a result, children seem to get the flu repeatedly, when in fact
they are contracting different strains of the virus.<BR><BR>

    <LI> While flu vaccinations are widely available, it is estimated that only
1%-7% of children receive them each year.<SUP>(3)</SUP><BR><BR>

    <LI> Children may also be at more risk for the complications of flu, such as
bronchitis, pneumonia, and secondary bacterial infection, and thus for a
greater number of hospital visits and absences from school.<SUP>(4)</SUP><BR><BR>

<P>
     SOUTHFIELD, Mich., Dec. 12, 1996 -- Blue Care Network reports that
its affiliated physician practices and medical centers are seeing an influx of
Michigan residents with cold weather illnesses.  While Blue Care Network does
not keep data on illness trends, the HMO's doctors are seeing a high incidence
of members with respiratory infections, gastrointestinal illnesses and sinus
discomforts.  This is expected to continue through the holidays, predicts Blue
Care Network-Health Central medical director G. Dale Rice, DO.
</P>

<P>
    "We all need to remember to take care of ourselves during the holidays,"
said Dr. Rice recently.  "Good lifestyle habits can pay off in avoiding
illnesses."
</P>

<P>
    Dr. Rice offers these tips on how to stay healthy during the cold and flu
season:
</P>

<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
 	<LI>Wash hands frequently and thoroughly.  Hand contact is known to be
         the number one cause of becoming infected with a virus.
	<LI>Be aware of crowded public places as breeding grounds for germs.
         After you have touched the grocery cart handle or the mall rest room
         	door, see number one above.

 	<LI>Take care of yourself.  Enjoy holiday revelry, but get plenty of
         rest.  In addition to holiday sweets, eat a balanced diet.  Fruits
        and vegetables are thought to boost the body's natural immune system.

 	<LI>Humidify your home.  Dryness caused by home heating systems can cause
         irritation to delicate linings of nose and sinus areas.
</OL>

<a name="Focus"></a>
<H3>Focus On Behaviors That Need To Be Changed</H3>




<P>Students who are referred to as having "conduct disorders" and
students who  are referred to as having "emotional disabilities,"
"behavioral disorders," "serious  emotional disturbances," or
"emotional and behavioral disorders" have two  common  elements that
are instructionally relevant: (1) they demonstrate behavior that is
noticeably different from that expected in school or the community and
(2) they are in  need of remediation.</P>

<P>In each instance, the student is exhibiting some form of behavior that
is judged to  be different from that which is expected in the
classroom. The best way to  approach a student with a "conduct
disorder" and a student with a "behavioral disorder" is to
operationally define exactly what it is that each student does that is
discrepant with the expected standard. Once it has been expressed in
terms of behaviors that can be  directly observed, the task of
remediation becomes clearer. A student's verbally abusive behavior can
be addressed, whereas it is difficult to directly identify  or
remediate  a student's "conduct disorder," since that term may refer
to a variety of  behaviors of widely different magnitudes. The most
effective and efficient approach is to pinpoint the specific
behavioral problem and apply data-based instruction to remediate it.
(Lewis, Heflin, &amp; DiGangi, 1991, p.9)</P>

<HR>

<a name="Identify"></a>
<H3>Identify New Behaviors To Be Developed  </H3>

<P>Two questions need to be addressed in developing any behavior change
procedure regardless of the student's current behavioral difficulty:
"What do I want the student  to do instead?" and "What is the most
effective and efficient means to help the student reach his or her
goals?" Regardless of whether the student is withdrawn or aggressive,
the objective is to exhibit a response instead of the current
behavior. We may want the student to play with peers on the playground
instead of  playing alone. We may want the student to play
appropriately with peers on the playground instead of hitting peers
during games. For both behavior patterns, we have  identified what  we
want them to do instead of the current problem behavior. (Lewis,
Heflin, &amp; DiGangi, 1991, p.14)</P>

<P>Using effective teaching strategies will promote student academic and
social behavioral success. Teachers should avoid focusing on students'
inappropriate behavior and, instead, focus on desirable replacement
behaviors. Focusing behavior management systems on positive, prosocial
replacement responses will provide students with the opportunity to
practice and be reinforced for appropriate behaviors. Above all else,
have fun with students!  Humor in the classroom lets students view
school and learning as fun. Humor can also be used to avoid escalating
behaviors by removing the negative focus from the problem. (Lewis,
Heflin, &amp; DiGangi, 1991, p.26).</P>

<HR>

<a name="Provide"></a>
<H3>Provide Opportunities To Practice New Behaviors  </H3>



<P>If we expect students to learn appropriate social skills we must
structure the learning environment so that these skills can be
addressed and practiced. We need to increase the opportunity for
students to interact within the school environment so that prosocial
skills can be learned. If all a student does is perform as a passive
participant in the classroom, then little growth in social skill
acquisition can be  expected. Just as  students improve in reading
when they are given the opportunity to read, they get  better at
interacting when given the opportunity to initiate or respond to
others' interactions.</P>

<P>It is necessary to target specific prosocial behaviors for appropriate
instruction and assessment to occur. Prosocial behavior includes such
things as </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> Taking turns, working with partner, following directions. <BR><BR>

	<LI> Working in group or with others. <BR><BR>

	<LI> Displaying appropriate behavior toward peers and adults. <BR><BR>

	<LI> Increasing positive relationships. <BR><BR>

	<LI> Demonstrating positive verbal and nonverbal relationships. <BR><BR>

	<LI> Showing interest and caring. <BR><BR>

	<LI> Settling conflicts without fighting. <BR><BR>

	<LI> Displaying appropriate affect. (Algozzine, Ruhl, &amp; Ramsey, 1991, pp.
	22-23)
</UL>

<HR>

<a name="Treat"></a>
<H3>Treat Social Skills Deficits As Errors In Learning </H3>



<P>Social skills deficits or problems can be viewed as errors in
learning; therefore, the appropriate skills need to be taught directly
and actively. It is important to base all social skill instructional
decisions on individual student needs. In developing a social skill
curriculum it is important to follow a systematic behavior change
plan.</P>

<P>During assessment of a student's present level of functioning, two
factors should be addressed. First, the teacher must determine whether
the social skill problem is due  to a skill deficit or a performance
deficit. The teacher can test the student by directly asking what he
or she would do or can have the student role play responses in several
social situations (e.g., "A peer on the bus calls you a name. What
should  you do?"). </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> If the student can give the correct response but does not display
the behavior outside the testing situation, the social skill problem
is probably due to a performance deficit. <BR><BR>

<LI> If the student cannot produce the socially correct response, the
social skill problem may be due to a skill deficit.
</UL>
<P>More direct instruction may be required to overcome the skill
deficits, while a performance deficit may simply require increasing
positive contingencies to increase the rate of displaying the
appropriate social response. During assessment, it is  important to
identify critical skill areas in which the student is having problems.</P>

<P>Once assessment is complete, the student should be provided with
direct social skill instruction. At this point, the teacher has the
option of using a prepared social skill curriculum or developing one
independently. It is important to remember that since  no single
published curriculum will meet the needs of all students, it should be
supplemented with teacher-developed or teacher-modified lessons.</P>

<P>Social skill lessons are best implemented in groups of 3 to 5 students
and optimally should include socially competent peers to serve as
models. The first social skill group lesson should focus on three
things: </P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> an explanation of why the group is  meeting,

	<LI> a definition of what social skills are, and


<LI> an explanation of what is expected of each student during the
group. It may also be helpful to implement behavior management
procedures for the group (i.e., contingencies for for compliance  and
non- compliance).
</OL>
<P>It is important to prompt the students to use newly learned skills
throughout the day and across settings to promote maintenance and
generalization. It is also important to reinforce the students when
they use new skills. (Lewis, Heflin, &amp; DiGangi, 1991, pp.17-18)</P>

<HR>

<a name="Teach"></a>
<H3>Teach Students To Take Responsibility For Their Own Learning  </H3>



<P>Often overlooked is the need to increase student independence in
learning. Students with BD may be particularly uninvolved in their
learning due to problems with self-concept, lack of a feeling of
belonging to the school, and repeated failures in school.
Instructional strategies involving self-control, self-reinforcement,
self-monitoring, self-management, problem solving, cognitive behavior
modification, and metacognitive skills focus primarily on teaching
students the skills necessary for taking responsibility and showing
initiative in making decisions regarding their own instruction. These
strategies, typically used in combination or in a "package format"
that incorporates extrinsic reinforcement, have shown promise for
enhancing student learning and independence. (Gable, Laycock, Maroney,
&amp; Smith, 1991, p.24)</P>

<HR>

<a name="Functional"></a>
<H3>Focus On Functional Skills That Will Have Broad Applications  </H3>


<P>Essential in a curriculum for students with behavioral problems are
skills that can directly improve the ultimate functioning of the
student and the quality of his or her life. The concept of functional
skills is not limited to the areas of self-help or community mobility,
but also include skills such as those required to seek and access
assistance, be life-long independent learners, respond to changes in
the  environment, succeed in employment, be adequately functioning
adults and parents, and achieve satisfying and productive lives. The
concepts of the functional curriculum approach, the criterion of
ultimate functioning, and participation to the highest degree possible
in life must be extended to students with BD, many of whom will
otherwise fail to fulfill their potential. (Gable, Laycock, Maroney, &amp;
Smith, 1991, p.28)</P>

<P>
    AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Dec. 13, 1996 -- In the wake of recent public
concern about air bags and children, Chrysler Corporation (NYSE: C), the
American Automobile Association (AAA), and the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP) announced today that schools and day care centers across the U.S. will
receive special educational materials on air bag safety.  The campaign is one
of the largest efforts of its kind ever conducted, and will be supported by a
host of other prominent safety, law enforcement and medical organizations.
</P>

<P>
    A letter announcing the "ABC's of Air Bag Safety -- The Back is Where It's
At" educational program will be sent to more than 300,000 teachers,
principals, school board and PTA presidents representing some 160,000 day
care and private and public elementary schools across the nation.  The
materials developed by Chrysler and Lifetime Learning Systems of Fairfield,
Connecticut, and with guidance from safety experts and educators, will be
delivered to schools in January.
</P>

<P>
    "Our message is simple: air bags are life-saving devices and saving lives
every day," said Chrysler Chairman and CEO Robert J. Eaton.  "But special
precautions must be taken when driving children in air bag equipped vehicles.
Children risk injury if they are unbelted, belted improperly or otherwise too
close to the instrument panel when an air bag inflates.  Parents and children
alike need to know that to play it safe, kids need to ride in the back seat
whenever possible.  Infants in rear-facing child seats must ride in the back
seat, no exceptions."
</P>

<P>
    The ABCs of Air Bag Safety is structured to encourage good safety habits
in children through traditional classroom learning.  Concerns about air bags,
prompted by the deaths of more than 30 children, motivated Chrysler, AAA, AAP
and other organizations to join forces to educate parents and children alike
on proper occupant protection.  Teaching safety in the classroom during the
formative years provides an opportunity to instill positive attitudes and
behavior that students will retain for life.  Professionally-developed
instructional materials ensure that the lessons are age-appropriate and
prepared in usable formats for teachers.
</P>

<P>
    "It's never too early to begin teaching children about the importance of
auto safety," said AAA President Robert L. Darbelnet.  "Despite all of our
efforts, almost 60% of children killed in vehicle crashes are unrestrained.
We believe this training program will go a long way toward reducing these
numbers.  Our involvement continues AAA's long history of work in child
passenger safety."
</P>

<P>
    "As a child health safety advocate, the AAP enthusiastically supports ways
to educate both children and parents about automobile safety," said AAP
President Robert Hannenmann, M.D.  "The ABCs of Air Bag Safety materials
emphasize the importance of children riding in the rear seat of an automobile
because it is the safest place for them to be."
</P>

<P>
    The National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also is
supporting the program and asking its ten regional offices to promote it in
states and communities.  NHTSA reports that air bags have saved more than
1,500 lives, but warns that certain safety rules need to be followed for
maximum benefit and to prevent injury or death to children.  The agency
advises that children age 12 and under should ride in the back seat, either in
a child safety seat or using the vehicle's lap/shoulder belts, depending on
the child's age and weight.
</P>

<P>
    "Many parents understandably are concerned about air bags and want
information on how their children can ride safely," said NHTSA administrator
Dr. Ricardo Martinez, a board-certified emergency physician.  "They also want
their children to be able to make smart choices about personal safety.  This
important educational campaign delivers on that need, and should become the
forerunner of continuous efforts to make safety a routine part of classroom
learning."
</P>

<P>
    The ABCs of Air Bag Safety educational materials will seek to convince
children that it is "cool" to sit in the back seat, using the slogan, The
Back is Where It's At!  Included in the comprehensive package for teachers
are brochures explaining why the back seat is the safest place for children to
ride, an instructional video, teachers' guides, wall posters, colorful
stickers for the children to use, and more than 30 million take-home pamphlets
so parents will better understand the importance of requiring their children
to ride in the back seat.
</P>

<P>
    In addition, each student will receive a "Family's New Year Resolution"
pledge form designed to encourage a family discussion -- and decision -- that
all children will ride in the back seat, buckled up.
</P>

<P>
    Although Chrysler is enabling the program by providing the funding, with
the advice and counsel of the AAA and the AAP, many other organizations with
an interest in education and highway safety, in addition to NHTSA, are
supporting it enthusiastically.  Included are the American Federation of
Teachers, Emergency Nurses CARE, International Association of Chiefs of
Police, Fraternal Order of Police, National Association of Governors' Highway
Safety Representatives, the Air Bag Safety Campaign, National Safety Council,
Optimist International, and the American Medical Association.

<P>
    NEW YORK, Dec. 12, 1996/ Five to seven million children wake up
every morning in a wet bed.  A new survey of 9,000 families found that despite
the prevalence of the condition, only some parents understand that
bed-wetting, medically known as primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE), may be a
medical --not behavioral-- condition that can be treated.
</P>

<P>
    Nearly half the people surveyed (47 percent)<SUP>A</SUP> mistakenly believe
bed-wetting, or primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE), is a condition associated
solely with drinking too many liquids before going to bed.  "Although limiting
liquids with caffeine before bedtime should be encouraged, parents should
understand that bed-wetting may be a common medical problem, and their child's
physician is the best source of information about treatment for a
bed-wetting child," confirms Marc Cendron, M.D., Pediatric Urologist at
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire.
</P>

<P>
    "Last year at my son's school physical, we were pleased to discover that
there are treatments available for bed-wetting," said Mrs. Dillehay, a
Tennessee resident and mother of two.  "Treating my son's bed-wetting problem
has changed his whole outlook on life; he can now attend sleepovers and the
entire family doesn't worry about his condition anymore."
</P>

<P>
    Other Findings, According To The Poll:
</P>
<UL>
	



    <LI> MYTH:  Child wets the bed on purpose.  <BR>FACT:  Bed-wetting is not the
         child's fault, and is known to run in families.  In fact, researchers
         have identified the first direct genetic link to PNE on a single
         region of chromosome 13.  "We now have scientific evidence that many
         cases of bed-wetting are caused by genetic factors beyond a child's
         and parent's control," said Hans Eiberg, associate professor at the
         Danish Centre for Genome Research, who discovered the specific
         genetic marker.  Research suggests that if both parents have a
         history of bed-wetting, their child has a 77 percent chance of
         wetting the bed.  If only one parent was a bed-wetter, a child has a
         44 percent chance of wetting the bed.  There is only a 15 percent
         chance of a child bed-wetting if neither parent has a history of the
         problem.
<BR><BR>


    <LI> MYTH:  Child is lazy.  <BR>FACT:  While the exact cause of PNE has not
         been identified, research indicates that bed-wetting is usually a
         physiological and not a behavioral problem.  Recent studies have
         found that some children who wet the bed lack a normal increase in
         antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which controls urine production at night.
        "In non bed-wetters, ADH levels increase at night, leading to a
         decrease in urine production.  In some bed-wetters, there is no
         increase, or it's insufficient, resulting in an overproduction of
         urine and, thus, bed-wetting," said Lane Robson, M.D., Pediatric
         Nephrologist at The Children's Hospital in Greenville, South
         Carolina.<BR><BR>



    <LI> MYTH:  Bed-wetting is a result of deep sleeping patterns;  fully
         waking a child is helpful.  <BR>FACT:  Although 44 percent<SUP>A</SUP> of the
         parents surveyed believe bed-wetting is caused by a child's deep
         sleeping patterns, studies have shown that fully waking a child
         throughout the night to urinate is not a useful intervention.
        "Parents who wake bed-wetting children interrupt the child's sleeping
         patterns, as well as their own.  Waking the child to full
         consciousness repeatedly is a disruption, and may lead to sleep
         deprivation for the entire family," said Dr. Robson.
<BR><BR>
</UL>
<P>
    Two-thirds (70 percent)<SUP>A</SUP> of parents surveyed indicated they do not worry
about their child's bed-wetting and assume their child will outgrow the
problem.  Yet, only 15 percent of bed-wetting children will spontaneously
outgrow the condition each year, and some continue to be affected until
adulthood.
</P>

<P>
    "It is important that parents have compassion and care when dealing with a
bed-wetting child so as to avoid feelings of shame, which is the number one
emotion associated with enuresis," said Brian F. Greer, M.D., a child
psychiatrist in private practice in Boca Raton, Florida.  "Of all the negative
emotions, shame is the most devastating for the child, as it often leads to
the greatest number of disruptions in personality development.  Such
disruptions may reveal themselves in poor school performance, antisocial
behavior, isolation, and depression."  Twenty-one percent<SUP>A</SUP> of parents
surveyed say they punish their child when he or she wets the bed.  "There is
absolutely no role for punishment in the treatment of bed-wetting," said Dr.
Greer.
</P>

<P>
    Treatment begins with a thorough history, a physical exam, and a
urinalysis.  The physician will then decide how the child should be treated
and provide the parents and child with information and counseling.  Treatments
for PNE may include behavioral modification and drug therapy.  The main
behavioral modification technique used is a signal alarm device or moisture
alarm, where a child gradually learns to associate bladder fullness with a
conditioned response.  Many medications have been recommended for treating the
bed-wetting child.  The most commonly used medications may include nasal
sprays and tricyclic antidepressants.  Contact your physician for more
information.
</P>

<P>
    <SUP>(A) </SUP>Respondents could choose more than one option, and thus, percentages
exceed one hundred.
</P>

<P>
    The National Kidney Foundation has an informational hotline where the
public can obtain free literature on enuresis.  The toll-free number is
800-622-9010.
</P>


                        <H3>Bed-Wetting:  Do's And Don'ts</H3>


<P>
    William J. Cromie, M.D., Chief, Section of Pediatric and Reconstructive
Urology and Vice Chairman, Department of Surgery at the University of Chicago,
offers the following practical tips to help the parents of bed-wetters:
</P>
<UL>
	



    <LI> Do talk to your doctor about bed-wetting.  Even if your physician
         doesn't mention the condition, don't be afraid to ask questions about
         this common problem.  A urine test is important to rule out medical
         conditions, such as urinary tract infection and diabetes.<BR><BR>
        
    <LI> Do give your child an explanation of what is happening to him/her.
         You could be the positive role model your child needs.  Learning
         about the problem helps both the child and family cope with their
         natural concerns.<BR><BR>
    <LI> If you were a former bed-wetter, share your experience with your
         child.  Making sure that your child understands that bed-wetting may
         be hereditary can ease your child's anxiety and better help him/her
         cope with this condition.<BR><BR>
    <LI> Do change your child's habits.  Encourage the child to urinate before
         going to bed.  Have him/her avoid foods and drinks containing
         caffeine, which can increase the output of urine.<BR><BR>
        
    <LI> Most importantly, don't punish or belittle your child as it only adds
         to the child's embarrassment.  Support your child by seeking the
         professional advice of a pediatric urologist or an expert in the
         field.<BR><BR>

<P>
    SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 5, 1996/ -- Imagine a child who can't ride a
rocking horse or one who can't grasp the little wooden pieces of a puzzle, or
a child who can't locate a tiny on/off switch underneath a mechanical toy.
These situations are far too real for hundreds of children with disabilities.
</P>

<P>
    Occupational therapists and technicians from Allied Services
rehabilitation hospitals in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pa., have developed a way
to make playtime fun and rewarding for these special children.  Through
Allied's Annual Holiday Toy Adaptation Program, children with special needs
can have their toys custom-modified so that they can use and enjoy them.
</P>

<P>
    According to James L. Brady, president of Allied Services, a rocking horse
can be fitted with an elevated seat-back, a lap belt, and larger hand grips,
so that a child with limited trunk control can feel secure while he or she
rocks away.  Parents also benefit, because they no longer have to hang onto
the child all of the time for fear that he or she will fall off.
</P>

<P>
    "Our dream is to establish a National Toy Adaptation Network, where
healthcare providers across the country can provide this much needed service
for children in their communities," Brady says.
</P>

<P>
    Brady cites additional examples of how toys can be modified to better
facilitate play:  Puzzles can have wooden or plastic knobs attached to the top
of each piece, so that a child with reduced dexterity can more easily grasp
the pieces.  Mechanical toys, like a motorized plush animal, can be activated
by attaching a large external switchpad, that a child can press down on with
his or her hand, elbow, forehead, etc.
</P>

<P>
    Most modifications are inexpensive to make, use very basic materials and
have resulted from a combination of need and a little ingenuity, Brady says.
All modifications are provided free of charge to children and their families.
Allied's program runs from November through January, a crucial time for
holiday toy purchases.
</P>

<P>
    Therapists and technicians not only modify existing toys, but they provide
parents with pre-shopping advice about which toys are best suited for their
child's specific needs.  All parents have to do is pick up the phone and make
an appointment to stop by with their children.
</P>

<P>
    Allied also has two toy lending libraries at its rehabilitation hospitals
where youngsters with disabilities can "sign out" specially modified toys in
much the same way that books are borrowed from a traditional library.
</P>

<P>
    Since 1984, dozens of children with arthritis, cerebral palsy, Down's
syndrome, multiple sclerosis and other diagnoses have been able to experience
the benefits and excitement of play thanks to the program.
</P>

<P>
    "We're pleased to offer this program to children with disabilities," says
Brady.  "It gives us great satisfaction when we can modify a child's toy so
that he or she can enjoy it during the holidays and all year long."
</P>

<P>
    For more information on the Holiday Toy Adaptation Program, or how to
establish a toy adaptation program in your community, contact Allied Services
at 717-348-1300.

<P>
   DALLAS, Nov. 22, 1996 -- Children's bright eyes epitomize the
holiday season, but they can quickly become weary eyes without careful parent
involvement.  From toy safety to the effects of computer games, children's
vision is particularly vulnerable at this time of year.  In fact, a recent
survey cites toys as the number one cause of eye injury to children.  In 1995,
over 15,000 eye injuries involving toys were reported in hospital emergency
rooms, according to Prevent Blindness.
</P>

<P>
    "Most eye injuries caused by toys are completely preventable," said Jeff
Smith, 0.D. and vice president of professional affairs for Pearle Vision.
"Many parents are simply unaware of what to look for to maximize eye safety."
</P>

<P>
    Some tips that Dr. Smith suggests parents consider before purchasing toys
for their children include:
<UL>
    	<LI>Avoid toys that shoot objects, have parts that fly off or have sharp
       	edges.
    	<LI>Look for the ASTM label, which means the product meets the safety
       	standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials.
     	<LI>Follow manufacturer's suggested age level for a toy.
     	<LI>Make sure toys are well made and durable.
</UL>
</P>

<P>
    Children do not need physical contact with a toy for it to be dangerous.
Another potential eye hazard called Computer Vision Syndrome can result from
the countless hours children are likely to spend playing new computer games
received over the holidays.  "Extended exposure to computer screens is
particularly straining on children's eyes because they are still developing,"
said Dr. Smith.  "Focusing on an object in close proximity for an extended
amount of time can cause eye fatigue, headaches or spasms in children's eyes."
</P>

<P>
    Some tips that Dr. Smith suggests parents consider when children are
spending time on the computer:
</P>

<P>
<UL>
    	<LI>Be sure a child sits at least an arm's length away from the computer
       	monitor or television screen when playing computer or video games.
   	<LI>Put reference material next to the screen on a copy stand to reduce eye
       stress caused by looking down repetitively.
    	<LI>Encourage intermittent breaks away from the computer screen to give
       	eyes a chance to rest.
   	<LI>Position the monitor perpendicular to windows and place a glare reduction filter over the computer screen.  (Look for a filter that has
       	received the American Optometric Association Seal of Acceptance.)
</UL>
</P>

<P>
    Pearle Vision's Focus On America's Youth initiative is working to educate
parents about toy safety and computer eyecare tips.  The program was created
to help raise awareness of the importance of preventative eyecare for
children.
</P>

<P>
    Dr. Smith added that the school vacation for the holidays is a great time
to take a child for their annual eye exam.  The American Optometric
Association recommends that a child's eyes be examined once by the time they
are six months, again at age three and annually after the age of five.

<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Evenflo Company Inc. of
Piqua, Ohio is warning consumers that some of its Houdini
Portable Playyards may present a potential small parts
choking hazard and a sharp edge hazard.  Approximately
205,000 of these playyards were sold. Small plastic covers
from "push caps" used to secure various parts of the
playyards together may crack and separate.
</P>

<P>
     Evenflo and the CPSC are aware of a number of reports
of the plastic caps separating.  Although no injuries have
been reported, this action is being taken to prevent young
children from choking or cutting themselves.  
</P>

<P>
     All Houdini model numbers beginning with 332 are
involved in this warning.  The model number is located on a
tag attached to the bottom of the unit. The playyards sold
nationwide for about $45 from 1994 through 1996. CPSC and
Evenflo are advising all Houdini owners to inspect the
pushcaps on their playyards.
</P>

<P>
     The push caps on Houdini Playyards are small metal
washers covered by a plastic clip.  In some cases, these
plastic clips have cracked and separated from the metal
washer. The plastic clip could then present a choking
hazard, and the exposed metal washer may be sharp
enough to cut a child. The exposed metal washer will
continue to hold the playyard securely together.
</P>

<P>
     Each playyard contains 16 push caps with three located
in each corner of the top rail, and one in the center of
each top rail. Consumers should look for loose, cracked, or
missing plastic covers. If any are found, consumers should
call Evenflo at (800) 490-7549 immediately to obtain free
replacement push caps and installation instructions. Even if
no loose, cracked, or missing plastic covers are found,
consumers should call for a free warning label.
</P>

<P>
     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death from
15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's
fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772
or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To order a press
release through fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051 from the
handset of your fax machine and enter the release number.
Consumers can obtain this release and recall information at
CPSC's web site at http://www.cpsc.gov or via Internet
gopher services at cpsc.gov. Consumers can report
product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), Oriental Trading Company of Omaha, Neb., is voluntarily
recalling approximately 44,400 wooden toys because some of the paint on
the toys contains high levels of lead.  CPSC standards ban toys containing
high levels of lead.  Young children might swallow lead if they chewed on
these toys.  Although no reports of illness or injury have been received,
this recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of lead
poisoning.
</P>

<P>
     Two types of wooden toys are involved in this recall.  One toy is a
set of 32 wooden beads with a cord for stringing the beads, packaged in a
clear plastic bag labeled (in part): "OTC Item No. M-027/653 QTY: 1PC MADE
IN CHINA."  The other toy is a set of six spinning tops, packaged in a
clear plastic bag labeled (in part): "OTC ITEM NO: M-027/294 QTY: 1 SET
MADE IN CHINA."
</P>

<P>
     These two toys were sold from September 1994 to November 1996 through
the firm's catalogs for under $4 and through retail stores.
</P>

<P>
     Consumers who purchased these wooden toys from toy stores should
return them for a full refund or full credit.  Consumers who purchased the
toys through Oriental Trading's catalog should call the company at (800)
228-0045 to obtain refund instructions.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC), Speidel of Providence, R.I., is
recalling about 211,000 children's identification bracelets sold
under the name My First ID. The bracelets present a choking
hazard to children under age 3.
</P>

<P>
     The bracelets are marketed for children packaged in a
cardboard gift box shaped like a wooden alphabet block labeled,
"MY FIRST ID by Speidel." A label attached to the bracelet
warning that the bracelet is not intended for children under age
3 is not visible at the point of sale. Some bracelets were
additionally labeled, "...Specially sized for little
ones...Perfect for commemorative first occasions like:...First
Birthdays...First Words...First Steps..."
</P>

<P>
     CPSC and Speidel are not aware of any injuries involving
these bracelets. This recall is being conducted to prevent the
possibility of injury.
</P>

<P>
     The gold- or silver-tone metal bracelets, measuring 5 to 5
1/2 inches long, can be engraved with identification or
commemorative information. The bracelets came in the following
eight styles (model numbers are found on a sticker on the box):
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>   Model 2350 is a metal chain of small, simulated pearls in
	linked, metal settings with a heart-shaped charm. 

	<LI>    Models 2351 through 2354 are metal chains with a thin curved
plate (measuring between 3/4 and 1 3/8 inches long by 3/16 and
	1/2 inch wide) for engraving, with a heart, cross, or bear charm
	attached.

	<LI>    Models 2355, 2589, and 2590 are metal chains with a thin
	curved plate (measuring between 3/4 and 1 3/8 inches long by 3/16
	and 1/2 inch wide) for engraving. Model 2355 has a heart-shaped
	cut out on the plate.
</UL>

<P>
     The bracelets sold at Wal-Mart, JCPenney, Hills, Cole Gift
Centers, and Meijer stores along with other department, discount,
and jewelry stores nationwide from June 1995 through December
1996 for about $11 to $16.
</P>

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC) announced today the stop sale and recall
of more than 32,000 dangerously flammable chenille sweaters
sized for girls and women. The sale of these sweaters
violates the federal Flammable Fabrics Act, and the sweaters
present a serious risk of burn injuries. In fact, these
sweaters burn faster than newspaper.
</P>

<P>
     Although CPSC has not received reports of injuries from
these sweaters to date, the agency is issuing this safety
notice and recalling the sweaters to prevent injuries from
these dangerous products.
</P>

<P>
     The sweaters, which were made in China, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, and the United States, are made in a variety of
colors of very soft textured chenille. Sweater styles are
primarily long sleeved or short sleeved with a crew or
turtle neckline; although, there is also a  v-neck vest
style and a mock wrap style. The sweaters sold for between
$38 and $130 at large department stores and small boutiques
nationwide. Nearly all of these sweaters are made
of 65 percent rayon/35 percent nylon; although, a few styles
are made of 90 percent rayon/10 percent nylon, 67 percent
rayon/33 percent nylon, or 100 percent rayon. 
</P>

<P>
     CPSC is working with a number of importers and
retailers to recall these sweaters.
CPSC surveyed over 100 retail stores in major U.S. cities to
test for the fire hazard.   
</P>

<P>
     CPSC urges consumers to immediately stop wearing
sweaters they believe may be involved in this recall. These
flammable sweaters should be returned to the retailers
where purchased.  Retailers taking part in this recall will
provide a refund or credit.  
</P>

<P>
     The following major retailers sold the sweaters:

WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), Shelby Ltd., Division of Wang's International, of
Memphis, Tenn., is recalling about 40,000 paperweights and pens because
they contain kerosene or other petroleum distillates and many were sold to
children. If the paperweights or pens break and leak, the liquid can be
hazardous if inhaled into the lungs or swallowed. The liquid could also be
combustible, presenting a flammability hazard.
</P>

<P>
     Shelby Ltd. has received at least 10 reports of the paperweights
breaking and releasing their contents. No injuries have been reported. 
</P>

<P>
     The plastic paperweights came in the following five styles: Ocean In
The Box, Floating Eye, Antique Car, Magic Diamond, and Water Timer. The
paperweights were individually packaged in cardboard boxes bearing the
name of the style. The pen, which is clear plastic with an eyeball in the
middle, is packaged in a cellophane wrap and bears no labeling.
</P>

<P>
     The paperweights and pen were sold nationwide through school stores
to children from kindergarten through the sixth grade from October through
December 1996 for about $4 to $5.
</P>

<P>
     Consumers should take the paperweights and pens away from children
immediately, and call Wang's at (800) 829-2647 for instructions on
returning the items for a full refund.
</P>

<P>    NEW YORK, Dec. 4, 1996 -- There's no time for dawdling during these
final weeks before the holidays.  So if you find yourself dazed and confused,
meandering endlessly through toy stores, you may appreciate this advice.</P>

<P>    Toy experts Joanne and Stephanie Oppenheim are encouraging parents to
remember six important criteria when shopping for quality holiday toys:</P>

<ol>

 <li>Safety -- Is the product well-designed?  Can it withstand the
unexpected? </p>
 <li>Age-appropriateness -- Does it fit the developmental needs, interests
and typical skills of the children for whom it was designed? </p>
  <li> Lasting play value -- What will a child learn from the toy?  Is it a
"smart" product that will engage the child's mind, or simply a novelty with
limited play value? </p>
   <li> Entertainment value -- No matter how "educational" a toy is, it should
never be boring.  Battery-operated toys with bells and whistles can engage,
educate and entertain a child. </p>
 <li> Messages conveyed -- What values and messages is a child going to
learn from the toy? </p>
   <li> Assembly and batteries -- Read labels carefully so there are no
assembly surprises, and keep plenty of batteries on-hand so play keeps going
and going.

</ol>

<P>    "Remembering six basic tips won't add more than a few moments to your
holiday shopping," said Joanne Oppenheim.  "But it can add a lifetime to your
children's play and the toys' play value."</P>

<P>    The Oppenheims tested thousands of toys using these criteria and wrote
about the results in their new book "The Best Toys, Books, Videos &amp;  Software
for Kids 1997," which highlights 1,000 of the highest quality classic and new
products for children through age 10.</P>

<P>    The Oppenheims have high standards for top-quality products, so they
tested dozens of battery-operated toys with Energizer(R) brand Batteries.</P>

<P>    "We used the Energizer on-battery tester during our toy tests," said
Stephanie Oppenheim.  "It satisfied our most important criteria for batteries:
they kept our toys going and were easy-to-use."</P>

<P>    With the new Energizer on-battery tester, consumers can test battery power
on the spot by pressing two green dots.  At full power, the word "Good"
appears in the tester window.  When the tester stays completely black, less
than 25 percent of the power remains and the battery may soon need replacing.
The on-battery tester is available in AA, C and D cell sizes.</P>

<P>    The Oppenheims' complete list of shopping criteria and other great toy
suggestions are profiled in a free consumer brochure, "Toys with Play Power:
A Grown-ups' Guide to Great Kids' Stuff."  The brochure also includes a
special coupon for a free copy of the Oppenheims' book (a $13.00 value),
available with two proofs of purchase from any Energizer on-battery tester
pack plus $1.50 shipping and handling.  To order the brochure, call
1-800-KIDS-450.</P>

<P>    CONTACT:  Kate Peters of Golin-Harris, 312-836-7272, or
Harriet Blickenstaff of Energizer, 314-995-3939, or Stephanie Oppenheim of the
Oppenheim Toy Portfolio, 212-598-0502</P>

<P>
Children with low self-esteem often feel like they're drowning ocean of inadequacy. This is the fourth in a series of articles based upon the workshop presented at our Conference by our past president, Pat Palmer. <address>( KidSource Editor's note: the other 3 articles, are listed on the left) </address>
</P>
<P>
A sure sign of low self-esteem is the child who says &quot;I'm dumb,&quot; &quot;I'm ugly,'' or who blames others for their mistakes. Both parents and teachers can help children overcome these negative self-images. Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
<B>Give the child responsibilities.
</B>
</P>
<P>
Self esteem grows when a child feels he makes a contribution.
</P>
<P>
<B>Allow the child to make choices.</B>
</P>
<P>
Can the child request time-out if <b>he</b> feels the need?
</P>
<P><B>Show appreciation. </B>
</P>

<P>
It's important to catch the child doing something right. Be generous with thanks and compliments, but be honest. A child knows when you are insincere.
</P>

<P>
<B>Treat mistakes positively.</B>
</P>

<P>
Children should know that mistakes are expected and are experiences to learn from. Correct them in a way that encourages: &quot;You almost got it.&quot; &quot;That was a good guess.
</P>

<P>
<B>Role playing</B>
</P>

<P>
This technique can explore alternatives to aggressive behavior, and help the children to understand the other person's feelings and actions. Use instant replay for planning the next time the child is faced with a similar problem.
</P>

<P>
<B>Validate the child's feelings.</B>
</P>

<P>
When she says something negative, acknowledge this with a response like, &quot;I can see how unhappy you are. Let's figure out how to make things better.&quot; 
</P>

<P>

Similarly, don't make light of a childhood trauma which may seem silly to you.
</P>

<P>
Tell the child he is brave and honest to admit his feelings. Show the children in your class that emotions are honest feelings, and how we deal with these feelings is the most important issue.
</P>

<P>
Help the children understand that happiness will return.
</P>

<P>    ELK GROVE, Ill., Nov. 25, 1996-- Several recent media reports have
erroneously stated the position of the American Academy of Pediatrics on
discipline for children and teens.  To clarify, the Academy position is that
alternatives to physical punishment are preferable means of discipline.</P>

<P>    The American Academy of Pediatrics has long advised parents to find
non-physical alternatives to spanking.  Hitting, slapping, or spanking
children as punishment shows them that it's okay to hit others to solve
problems, and can train them to punish others in the same way they were
punished.</P>

<P>    The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a variety of discipline
techniques, including "time-out."  "Time-out" is what we call a "behavior
modification technique."  When used correctly, "time-out" is effective from
the preschool period through early adolescence.  It works because it simply
removes the child from situations he or she is handling inappropriately, and
it keeps the child from getting attention that could otherwise reinforce bad
behavior.</P>

<P>    Parents should feel free to talk to their child's pediatrician about ways
to avoid inappropriate behavior by children, and about other alternatives to
spanking by parents.</P>

<P>    The root of the English word "discipline" is the Latin verb,
"disciplinare" which means to teach or instruct.  The goal of effective
discipline for children is to teach them acceptable and desired behavior.
That lesson comes from appropriate parental expectations, rules and behavior.</P>

<P>    Punishment should be a small component of an overall strategy to help
children develop self-discipline.  The role played by physical punishment is
still highly disputed and, in its harshest form, has been found to be harmful
to later development.  Punishment only informs children of what behavior is
unacceptable; it does not teach them what behavior their parents would like to
encourage.</P>

<P>    In 1991, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy calling for a
ban on corporal punishment in the schools.  At this time, the Academy is
drafting a new policy statement on effective discipline.  Although the policy
has not yet been finalized, it is anticipated that pediatricians will continue
to advise parents to find alternatives to physical punishment.</P>

<P>    Remember, discipline is supposed to teach and instruct.  Parents should
think about the lesson they are teaching their children through punishment,
and make sure it's the lesson they really want their children to learn.</P>

<P>    The American Academy of Pediatrics is an organization of
51,000 pediatricians dedicated to the health, safety and well-being of
infants, children, adolescents and young adults.</P>

<P>    LEXINGTON, Ky., Dec. 4, 1996 -- Computer units are altering
how families interact with each other and other technologies, which may result
in positive change for the American family.   This is among the principle
findings of a major new survey of 1,000 American households with a personal
computer, conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide for Lexmark International, a
leading printing solutions company.</P>

<P>    The survey, entitled "Lexmark Report on Computing and the American Family"
provides evidence that computer units are having far-reaching and often
positive impacts on families and are helping to provide solutions for some of
the most important challenges facing families today, including education,
communication and financial issues.</P>

<P>    "Just as the hearth acted as the focal point for the American family in
the 19th century, and television was in the 20th century, computer units are
rapidly becoming the centerpiece for the American family in 21st century,"
says Nick Tortorello, senior vice president of Roper Starch Worldwide and one
of the principle authors of the survey.  "Unlike the television itself,
computer units are not passive entertainment, and are therefore transforming
the paradigm of how people interact with technology and each other.  Computer
units are unleashing the collective imagination of families and the effects
are just now becoming discernible."</P>

<P>    In key areas critical to American families, the survey found computer
units are making a positive impact, specifically:</P>

 <ul>
 <li><b>Education:  Computer Units Help Make the Grade</b></p>
    
<P>    Nearly three-quarters of parents (72%) agree that using a PC unit has
helped their children become more creative, and nearly half (48%) say their
children would not do as well in school if they did not own a personal
computer (43% say their children's grades have improved through use of a
computer printer). And in the overwhelming majority (82%) of such households,
the computer printers have been used for school reports or projects.</P>

<P>    "The wide variety of print applications now available to students and
their parents provides an ideal forum for the sharing of ideas and the
creation of new and interesting projects for school and home," says Susan
Gauff, vice president of communications at Lexmark.  "The falling prices and
increased features of today's computers and color printers means that students
can easily afford products that will allow them to create whatever they can
imagine."</P>

<P>    Education benefits seem to stem from the common ways respondents report
using computer units to spend time with children. 68% report helping with
homework and 65% report running educational programs/CD-ROMS.  Parents also
report that computer ownership has also caused their children to spend less
time watching television (42%).</P>

<P>    Children also do not seem as afflicted by technology-phobia as some of the
rest of the family.  One third (33%) of parents report that their child feels
more comfortable using the computer than they, themselves, do especially if
they are 50 years old or older (44%).</P>

    <li><b>Communication:  Computer Units Give Families Quality Time Together</b>
    
<P>    Men may be from Mars, and women from Venus, but with computers they are at
least communicating more.  Keeping in touch with family and friends is one of
the most frequently mentioned aspects of computer ownership.  Among those who
are connected to an on-line service, 74% report using e-mail to keep in
touch with their friends and family.  In fact, 63% of those on the Internet
agree they are better able to stay in contact with these people
specifically because of on-line access.</P>

<P>    In households overall -- whether on-line or not -- computer units have
been used to produce personal correspondence to friends (77%) or family (71%)
and, in nearly one-quarter (23%) of homes, they are used to produce a family
newsletter.  Family newsletters are particularly popular in the West (28%) and
Midwest (27%), compared to the Northeast (17%) and South (20%) average.</P>

<P>    The survey found that, on average, parents spend 2.4 hours a week using
the computer with their children and, in about one in six families (16%),
parents log at least  five hours a week at the screen with their child.
(Parents in the South spend the most time each week at the computer with their
children 3.0 hours, on average.) In comparison, married (or living-as-married)
adults spend an average of 1.7 hours using a computer with their spouse or
"significant other."</P>

 <li><b>Financial Security:  Computer Units Help Families Get Ahead</b>
    
<P>    The survey found that computer units help family financial issues by
helping users become more successful in business, and by better managing
family finances. 59% of respondents agree that being on-line has helped them
get ahead in business, and 38% agree being on-line has helped them better
communicate with overseas colleagues.</P>

<P>    Respondents also report a measure of control over their present and future
finances.</P>

<P>    About half (52%) of American PC-owners who are married/living-as-married
and/or parents agree that they are better able to plan their family's
financial future because they own a computer.  Among all American PC-owners,
specific uses of financial applications include keeping finances in order
(59%), doing taxes (37%), and tracking investments (19%).</P>

<P>    Use of computer units also seems not to be divided by affluence.
Households with reported annual incomes under $40,000 are nearly as
likely to use their home computer for keeping track of finances than are
households with larger annual incomes (56% vs. 61%, respectively). But not
surprisingly, given the likelihood of their more complicated tax scenarios,
Americans with annual household incomes of at least $40,000 are more likely
than those with lower incomes to use their computers to do their taxes (40%
vs. 27%, respectively).</P>

</ul>

  <H3>  Methodology</H3>
<P>    The Lexmark International/Roper Starch Worldwide random telephone survey
of 1,000 Americans with a PC in their household was conducted by telephone in
August, 1996, and is representative of the American PC-owning household
population at large.  The sampling tolerance for this survey is
+/- 3.1 percentage points at a 95% confidence level.</P>

<H3>Introduction </H3>

<P>E. Coli is one of many diarrheal illnesses a child can contract; yet, its
severity warrants special attention. As a parent, you may be interested
in:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> how to help prevent E. Coli infections in your children
	<LI> what to do if you think your child has E. Coli
	<LI> how parents can help prevent and halt E. Coli epidemics
</UL>

<HR>
 <a name="Prevent"></a>
<H3>Possible Ways To Prevent E. Coli Infection In Young Children:</H3>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	
<LI> Give your child only pasteurized or sterilized fluids. In a grocery
store, pasteurized juices can be found in the unrefrigerated sections at a
grocery store, in a bottle, can or "box."  Pasteurized juices or milk
found in the refrigerated section should be labeled as such.  Interestingly,
only recently was milk required to be pasteurized throughout the U.S.<BR><BR>
<LI> Cook all beef products that your children eat until they are gray.<BR><BR>
<LI> Educate yourself about the sources of your fresh foods and how they can
become contaminated on their way to your child.<BR><BR>
<LI> Wash all fresh fruit and vegetables with and without inedible skins.
Some foods with skins, such as melons, grow on the ground and can be
contaminated with unsterilized manure. "According to Dean Cliver, a
professor of food safety at the University of California at Davis, no
research has been done to answer this question.  If you have reason to be
suspicious, he says, you should wash your fruit and vegetables with a
brush and water mixed with a capful of bleach per gallon... Cliver says it's
hoped that bleach is enough." (Source: San Jose Mercury News 11/20/96")<BR><BR>

<LI> Don't let your children swim, walk or otherwise come into contact with
any natural bodies of fresh water.  If they do, verify that the water has
been checked and ok'd by a health department.<BR><BR>
<LI> Insist on handwashing and avoidance of oral-fecal contact with other
children, especially in a daycare setting.<BR><BR>
<LI>Don't eat out, or if you do, be certain about the sanitary practices of
the restaurant.<BR><BR>
<LI> Feed your children only foods that have been cooked thoroughly.
</OL>

<P>If this sounds hard to do, it is. Until something is done about
contamination of the food supply, you simply cannot be certain that this
virulent bacteria will not affect your child.</P>

<P>Technology is bursting into the classroom at all levels, as a tool for
teachers to develop, monitor, and provide instructions, and for
students to access and engage in learning.  P.L. 100-407, The
Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of
1988 (Tech Act) was designed to enhance the availability and quality
of assistive technology (AT) devices and services to all individuals
and their families throughout the United States.</P>



<HR>

<a name="Assistive"></a>
<H3>What Are Assistive Technology (AT) Devices?  </H3>


<P>The Tech Act defines AT devices as any item, piece of equipment, or
product system (whether acquired off the shelf, modified, or
customized) that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional
capabilities of individuals with disabilities.  AT devices may be
categorized as high technology and low technology. Many low-tech
devices can be purchased at a hardware store, selected from a catalog,
or fabricated using tools and materials found in home workshops
(Franklin, 1991). Examples might be note-taking cassette recorders,
pencil grips, NCR paper/copy machine, simple switches, head pointers,
picture boards, taped instructions, or workbooks.  High-tech devices
frequently incorporate some type of computer chip, such as a hand-held
calculator or a "talking clock." Examples might be optical character
recognition (OCR) calculators, word processors with spelling and
grammar checking, word prediction, voice recognition, speech
synthesizers, augmentative communication devices, alternative
keyboards, or instructional software.</P>

<HR>

<a name="Applied"></a>
<H3>How Can AT Be Applied in Instruction? </H3>



<P>Lahm and Morrissette (1994) outlined seven areas of instruction where
AT could assist students with mild disabilities.  These areas include
organization, note taking, writing assistance, productivity, access to
reference materials, cognitive assistance, and materials modification.
A number of approaches are available to assist students with mild
disabilities in these areas of instruction.</P>

<P><B>Organization:</B>  Low-tech solutions include teaching students to
organize their thoughts or work using flow charting, task analysis,
webbing or networking ideas, and outlining.  These strategies can be
accomplished using graphic organizers to visually assist students in
developing and structuring ideas. A high-tech solution might be the
outline function of word processing software, which lets students set
out major ideas or topics and then add subcategories of information.</P>

<P><B>Note Taking: </B> A simple approach is for the teacher to provide copies
of structured outlines for students to use in filling in information.
A high-tech approach might include optical character recognition,
which is software that can transform typewritten material into
computer-readable text using a scanner. </P>

<P>A teacher's typewritten notes can be duplicated using either NCR paper
(carbonless copies) or a copy machine. A slightly more high-tech
method is to use microcassette recorders.  Or, notes can be read by a
voice synthesizer, allowing students with reading difficulty to review
the notes much the same as reviewing a tape recording.  Recorders are
beneficial for students with auditory receptive strength, but they may
be less useful for those needing visual input.  Videotaping class
sessions may be helpful for visual learners who pick up on images or
body language, or for students who are unable to attend class for
extended periods of time. </P>

<P>Laptop or notebook computers can provide high-tech note taking for
many students with disabilities.  An inexpensive alternative to a
full-function portable computer is the portable keyboard.  The
limitations of these keyboards are in formatting information and a
screen display limited to four lines of text.</P>

<P><B>Writing Assistance:</B> Word processing may be the most important
application of assistive technology for students with mild
disabilities.  Many of these students have been identified as needing
assistance in the language arts, specifically in writing.  Computers
and word processing software enable students to put ideas on paper
without the barriers imposed by paper and pencil.  Writing barriers
for students with mild disabilities include mechanics: spelling,
grammar and punctuation errors; process:  generating ideas,
organizing, drafting, editing, and revising; and motivation: clarity
and neatness of final copy, reading ability, and interest in writing.</P>

<P>Grammar/spellcheckers, dictionaries, and thesaurus programs assist in
the mechanics of writing.  Macros, a feature that allows keystrokes to
be recorded in a file that can be used over and over, also assist in
mechanics.  Macros can be used for spelling difficult text, for
repetitive strings of words, or for formatting paragraphs and pages.
Macros also save time for students who have difficulty with either the
cognitive or motor (keyboarding) requirements of writing.  Word
prediction is assistive software that functions similarly to macros.
If a student has difficulty with word recall or spelling and cannot
easily use the dictionary or thesaurus feature, then word prediction
software offers several choices of words that can be selected.  </P>

<P>Teachers can use the editing capabilities of the word processor during
the writing process, making electronic suggestions on the student's
disk.  If the computer is on a network, students can read each other's
work and make comments for revision.  Painter (1994) indicated that
peer feedback was an effective way to assist students in generating
and revising text.  Computer editing also reduces or eliminates
problems such as multiple erasures, torn papers, poor handwriting, and
the need to constantly rewrite text that needs only minor
modifications.  The final copy is neat and legible. </P>

<P>Motivation is often increased through the desktop-publishing and
multimedia capabilities of newer computers.  A variety of fonts and
styles are available, allowing students to customize their writing and
highlight important features.  Graphic images, drawings, and even
video and audio can be added to the project to provide interest or
highlight ideas.  Multimedia often gives the student the means and the
motivation to generate new and more complex ideas.  </P>

<P><B>Productivity: </B> Assistive productivity tools can be hardware-based,
software-based, or both. Calculators, for example, can be the
credit-card type or software based, which can be popped up and used
during word processing. Spreadsheets, databases, and graphics software
also offer productivity tools, enabling students to work on math or
other subjects that may require calculating, categorizing, grouping,
and predicting events. Productivity tools also can be found in small,
portable devices called personal digital assistants (PDAs). Newer PDAs
can be used as notetaking devices via a small keyboard or
graphics-based pen input. Some PDAs can translate words printed with
the pen input device to computer-readable text, which can then be
edited with the word processor and transmitted to a full function
computer.  </P>

<P>Access to Reference Materials:  Many students with mild disabilities
have difficulty gathering and synthesizing information for their
academic work.  In this arena, telecommunications and multimedia are
providing new learning tools for the students.</P>

<P>A computer and a modem can transport students beyond their physical
environment to access electronic information.  This is particularly
appropriate for individuals who are easily distracted when going to
new and busy environments such as the library.  Telecommunications
networks offer access to the information superhighway.  Students can
establish "CompuPals" with other students, which often motivates them
to generate more text and thus gain more experience in writing.
Students can also access electronic encyclopedias, library references,
and online publications.  However, these experiences should be
structured, because the information highway is complex and it is easy
to get distracted or lost as opportunities are explored.  </P>

<P>Multimedia-based tools are another way in which information can be
made accessible to students.  Multimedia's use of text, speech,
graphics, pictures, audio, and video in reference-based software is
especially effective in meeting the heterogeneous learning needs of
students with mild disabilities.  </P>

<P><B>Cognitive Assistance:</B>  A vast array of application program software is
available for instructing students through tutorials, drill and
practice, problem-solving, and simulations.  Many of the assistive
technologies described previously can be combined with instructional
programs to develop and improve cognitive and problem-solving skills. </P>


<P>Multimedia CD-ROM-based application programs offer another tool for
assisted reading. Similar to talking word processors, CD-based books
include high-interest stories that use the power of multimedia to
motivate students to read.  These books read each page of the story,
highlighting the words as they are read.  Additional clicks of the
mouse result in pronunciation of syllables and a definition of the
word.  When the student clicks on a picture, a label appears.  A
verbal pronunciation of the label is offered when the student clicks
the mouse again.  These books are available in both English and
Spanish, so students can read in their native language while being
exposed to a second language.
    </P>
<P><B>Materials Modification:</B> Special educators are familiar with the need
to create instructional materials or customize materials to meet the
varied needs of students with disabilities. Today there are powerful
multimedia authoring and presentation tools that educators can use to
develop and modify computer-based instructional materials for students
with mild disabilities, providing a learning tool that these students
can access and use to balance their weak areas of learning with their
strong areas.</P>

<P>Authoring software allows teachers and students to develop
instructional software that can incorporate video, pictures,
animation, and text into hypermedia-based instruction.  Multimedia
authoring software is very easy to learn and use.  In fact, authoring
software packages are even available for young children. For example,
if the objective is to teach map reading, an image of a local map can
be scanned in and specific locations can be made into buttons that the
students can click on, causing a short video clip playing of the
familiar location.  A set of questions might be asked using both text
and synthesized speech to have students give directions on how to get
the location shown on the video.  Students could then write directions
(or draw their own map).  Digitized pictures of landmarks could also
be incorporated into the directions.  These directions, along with the
images, could then be printed for use in completing the assignment.
Without the ability to author and incorporate multimedia easily into
instructional software, such computer-based training would be
impossible because of the need to incorporate the shared learning
concepts inherent in local environments into the assisted-learning
process.  Such instruction can make learning more efficient and
certainly more real for students for whom abstract learning and
generalization may be difficult.</P>

<P>
One of the most difficult tasks following the death of a loved one is discussing and explaining the death with the children in the family. This task is even more distressing when the parents are in the midst of their own grief.
</P>
<P>
Because many adults have problems dealing with death, they assume that children cannot cope with it. They may try to protect children by leaving them out of the discussions and rituals associated with death. Thus, children may feel anxious, bewildered, and alone. They may be left on their own to seek answers to their questions at a time when they most need the help and reassurance of those around them.
</P>
<P>
All children will be affected in some way by a death in the family. Above all, children who are too young for explanations need love from the significant people in their lives to maintain their own security. Young children may not verbalize their feelings about a death in the family. Holding back their feelings because they are so overwhelming, children may appear to be unaffected. It is more common for them to express their feelings through behavior and play. Regardless of this ability or inability to express themselves, children <b>do </b>grieve, often very deeply.
</P>
<P>
<hr>
<H3>Some Common Expressions Of Children's Grief</H3>
</P>
<P>
Experts have determined that those in grief pass through four major emotions: fear, anger, guilt, and sadness. It should be remembered that everyone who is touched by a death experiences these emotions to some degree - grandparents, friends, physicians, nurses, and children. Each adult's and child's reactions to death are individual in nature. However, some common reactions are:
</P>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>Shock.</B> The child may not believe the death really happened and will act as though it did not. This is usually because the thought of death is too overwhelming.<BR><BR>
	<LI><B>Physical Symptoms.</B> The child may have various complaints, such as headache or stomach-ache, and may fear that he too will die.<BR><BR>
	<LI><B>Anger.</B> Being mostly concerned with his own needs, the child may be angry at the person who died because he feels he has been left &quot;all alone,&quot; or that God didn't &quot;make the person well.&quot;<BR><BR>
	<LI><B>Sadness.</B>The child may show a decrease in activity - being &quot;too quiet.&quot;<BR><BR>
	<LI><B>Guilt.</B> The child may think that he caused the death by having been angry with the person who dies, or he may feel responsible for not having been &quot;better&quot; in some way.<BR><BR>
	<LI><B>Anxiety and Fear.</B>The child may wonder who will take care of him now, or fear that some other person he loves will die. He may cling to his parents or ask other people who play an important role in his life if they love him.<BR><BR>
	<LI><B>Regression.</B>The child may revert to behaviors he had previously outgrown, such as bed-wetting or thumb-sucking.<BR><BR>
</UL>
<P>
It is important to remember that all of the reactions outlined above are normal expressions of grief in children. In the grief process, time is an important factor. Experts have said that six months after a significant death in a child's life, normal routine should be resuming. If the child's reaction seems to be prolonged, seeking professional advice of those who are familiar with the child (e.g., teachers, pediatricians, clergy) may be helpful.
</P>
<P>
<hr>
<H3>Explanations That May Not Help</H3>
</P>
<P>
Outlined below are explanations that adults may give a child, hoping to explain why a person they loved has died. Unfortunately, simple but dishonest answers can only serve to increase the fear and uncertainty that the child is feeling. Children tend to be very literal - if an adult says that &quot;Grandpa died because he was old and tired,&quot; the child may wonder when he too will be too old; he certainly gets tired - what is tired enough to die?
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>&quot;Grandpa will sleep in peace forever.&quot; </B>This explanation may result in the child's fear of going to bed or to sleep.
<br><br>

	<LI><B>&quot;Daddy went away on a long trip and won't be back for a long time.&quot; </B>The child may wonder why the person left without saying good-bye. Eventually he will realize Daddy isn't coming back and feel that something he did caused Daddy to leave.<br><br>

	<LI><B>&quot;It is God's will.&quot; </B>The child will not understand a God who takes a loved one because He needs that person Himself; or <B>&quot;God took him because he was so good.&quot; </B>The child may decide to be bad so God won t take him, too.<br><br>

	<LI><B>&quot;John was sick and went to the hospital where he died. &quot; </B>The child will need an explanation about 'little&quot; and &quot;big&quot; sicknesses. Otherwise, he may be extremely fearful if he or someone he loves has to go to the hospital in the future.<br><br>

</UL>
<P>
<hr>
<H3>Ways To Help Children</H3>
</P>
<P>
As in all situations, the best way to deal with children is honestly. Talk to the child in a language that he can understand. Remember to listen to the child and try to understand what the child is saying and, just as importantly, what he's not saving. Children need to feel that death is an open subject and that they can express their thoughts or questions as they arise. Below are just a few ways adults can help children face the death of someone close to them:
</P>
<P>
<B>The child's first concern may be, &quot;Who will take care of me now?&quot;
</B></P>
<UL>
 	<LI>Maintain usual routines as much as possible.<BR><BR>
	<LI>Show affection, and assure the child that those who love him still do and that they <b>will </b>take care of him.<BR><BR>
</UL>
<P>
<B>The child will probably have many questions and may need to ask them again and again.
</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI>Encourage the child to ask questions and give honest, simple answers that can be understood. Repeated questions require patience and continued expression of caring.<BR><BR>
	<LI>Answers should be based on the needs the child seems to be expressing, not necessarily on the exact words used.<BR><BR>
</UL>
<P>
<B>The child will not know appropriate behavior for the situation.
</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI>Encourage the child to talk about his feelings and share with him how you feel. You are a model for how one expresses feelings. It is helpful to cry. It is not helpful to be told how one should or should not feel.<BR><BR>
	<LI>Allow the child to express his caring for you. Loving is giving <b>and </b>taking.<BR><BR>
</UL>
<P>
<B>The child may fear that he also may die, or that he somehow caused the death.</B>
</P>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Reassure the child about the cause of the death and explain that any thoughts he may have had about the person who died did <b>not</b> cause the death.<BR><BR>
	<LI>Reassure him that this does <b>not</b> mean someone else he loves is likely to die soon.<BR><BR>
</UL>
<P>
<B>The child may wish to be a part of the family rituals.
</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI>Explain these to him and include him in deciding how he will participate. Remember that he should be prepared beforehand, told what to expect, and have a supporting adult with him. Do not force him to do anything he doesn't feel comfortable doing.
</UL>
<P>
<B>	The child may show regressive behavior.
</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI>A common reaction to stress is to revert to an earlier stage of development. (For example, a child may begin thumb-sucking or bed-wetting, or may need to go back into diapers or have a bottle for a time.) Support the child in this and keep in mind that these regressions are temporary.
</UL>
<P>
Adults can help prepare a child to deal with future losses of those who are significant by helping the child handle smaller losses through sharing their feelings when a pet dies or when death is discussed in a story or on television.
</P>
<P>
In helping children understand and cope with death, remember four key concepts: be loving, be accepting, be truthful, and be consistent.

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. -  In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Price Stern Sloan Inc. of
Los Angeles is voluntarily recalling more than 34,000
Exploring Nature Funstation science activity book kits. The
kit is packaged with a compass that may leak fluid
containing kerosene. The compass can be hazardous to young
children if they ingest the kerosene or inhale it into their
lungs.</P>

<P>     Price Stern Sloan Inc. has received one report of  a
16-month-old child who vomited after ingesting fluid from
the compass. The kit is intended for children 8 and older.</P>

<P>     The Exploring Nature Funstation (ISBN # 08431-3942-0)
contains a book with a number of science projects and items
to perform the science projects including a compass,
magnifying glass, petri dish, crayons, a tweezers, test
tube, a thermometer, and stickers. Warehouse clubs,
bookstores, chain stores, and wholesalers sold the kits
nationwide from March 1996 through August 1996 for about $13
to $22.</P>

<P>     Consumers should take these recalled kits away from
children immediately. For information on how to exchange the
Exploring Nature Funstation activity kit, consumers can
contact Price Stern Sloan Inc. at (800) 454-1625 or write to
the company at: Price Stern Sloan Inc.,
Department Exploring Nature, 11835 Olympic Blvd. East Tower,
Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90064.</P>

<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death from
15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on
CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800)
638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To
order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301)
504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the
release number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall
information at CPSC's web site at http://www.cpsc.gov or via
Internet gopher services at cpsc.gov. Consumers can report
product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission CPSC), five bunk bed manufacturers
are recalling approximately 100,000 wooden bunk beds.
The bunk beds have openings on the top bunk that present a
potential entrapment hazard to young children. The spaces can
be large enough for a child's body to pass through, but
small enough to entrap the child's head.</P>

<P>     Since November 1994, CPSC and 26 manufacturers have
announced recalls of more han 411,400 wooden bunk beds with
similar entrapment hazards.  In response to this action,
the manufacturers participating in this recall have also
identified bunk beds with similar entrapment hazards.</P>

<P>     Since 1990, CPSC has received reports of 32 children
who died from becoming caught in bunk beds with similar
spaces in the top bunk. Thirty-one of those children were
ages 3 and under. The most recent death occurred on
September 28, 1996. A 3-year-old boy died from becoming
caught in a bunk bed manufactured by the Bedder Bunk
Company.</P>

<P>     The ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials)
voluntary standard for bunk beds requires that, in addition
to having guardrails on both sides of the top bunk, all
spaces between the guardrail and bed frame, and in the head
and foot boards on the top bunk, should be less than 3.5
inches. Bunk beds currently made by the companies listed
below now meet the spacing requirement of the voluntary
standard. The companies are also providing permanent labels
or placing permanent labels on their bunk beds to warn that
children under the age of 6 be prohibited from the upper
bunk. CPSC and the manufacturers continue to urge parents
and caregivers not to put children under the age of 6 on the
top bunk.</P>

<P>     The manufacturers listed below are participating in
this recall to improve the safety of these beds and to meet
the requirements of the voluntary standard. Consumers should
stop using the recalled beds immediately and call the
company or contact the retailer for a replacement guardrail,
retrofit kit, or instructions to help eliminate the
potential entrapment hazard. If consumers are not sure of
the bunk bed manufacturer or have questions about this
recall, they should call CPSC's Hotline at (800) 638-2772. </P>

<P>The primary cause of anxiety for many parents today is protecting
their children from acts of violence at school. In general, parents
and school officials are concerned about preventing children from
becoming either aggressors or victims. This brochure discusses what
steps parents and school administrators can take to make schools
safer.</P>


<HR>
<a name="Safety"></a>
<H3>What Is Being Done To Ensure My Child's Safety in School? </H3>


<P>Despite the extraordinary media coverage of and public concern over
violence in our schools, students are safer there than in any other
place except their homes. Still, school officials recognize the
potential threats to the safety of children attending school and
school-related activities. Many are seeking ways to help school
personnel control the school environment more effectively and to be
more visible and available to students who need better guidance. In
some districts, for example, drivers of school vehicles must
complete rigorous training in managing student behavior as well as
operating their vehicles safely. In addition, more school districts
are requiring routine drug screening for vehicle operators and are
training school personnel in crisis management and violence
intervention. Other violence-reduction strategies include: </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>

<LI><b>Teaching prevention skills</b>. Students are being taught mediation
skills (problem solving and communication) and ways to handle their
emotions--especially anger--without hurting others. These skills
will help them avoid potentially dangerous situations. Students are
also being taught "safe" behaviors such as doing activities in
groups, alerting school personnel if a stranger is on school
grounds, and reporting situations that threaten other students'
safety. <BR><BR>


<LI><b> Providing alternatives to gangs.</b> School districts and communities
are working together to offer students alternatives to gang
membership, including activities that build self-esteem and help
students deal with feelings of powerlessness. Strategies include
providing special assistance to students who are at risk of gang
membership, creating an atmosphere that fosters a sense of
belonging in all students, informing parents and school staff about
gangs and teaching students how to avoid being drawn into them, and
giving students regular opportunities to discuss school experiences
and to plan for future successes and rewards. <BR><BR>

<LI><b> Improving school designs</b>. As school buildings are constructed and
old ones are renovated, safety has become an essential element of
their design. In new schools, office areas are now centrally
located for easy accessibility from other locations in the building
or campus. Hallways have convenient exits and are well lit. Deadend
hallways and staircase hideaways have been eliminated, and
restrooms are located closer to administrators to prevent students
from hanging out.<BR><BR>

 <LI><b> Monitoring visitors carefully</b>. Schools are becoming more
assertive in screening visitors, requiring them to register when
entering the building or campus and by employing security
personnel. Schools can be both secure and friendly by requesting
visitors to check in rather than report to the office. Registered
visitors are given a pass or badge to display prominently to let
staff and students know that they have been acknowledged by the
administration. Staff and students are instructed to report people
without proper identification to a school administrator. In
addition, many schools now ask that parents give the names of
adults who are allowed to pick up a child, and require those
individuals to show identification to school personnel when signing
a student out.

<H3>How Can I Help My Child Practice Safe Behavior? </H3>


<P>Parents can teach their children safe behaviors before enrolling
them in school. Children who know the appropriate action to take in
a given situation are less likely to expose themselves to danger.
Safe behaviors to teach your child are:   </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>

 <LI><b> Not talking to strangers</b>. This warning is more important today
than ever before. Encourage your children to get to know school
staff other than their teachers and get acquainted with them
yourself. Familiarity helps children recognize adults who don't
belong as well as adults who can offer help when needed. As a plus,
children will also learn that the school staff are their friends
and more than just rule enforcers.<BR><BR>

 <LI><b> Taking safety in numbers</b>. Encourage your children to stay close
to friends and to walk in groups in school hallways. Suggest that
they limit their restroom visits to recess and breaks and use
facilities located in high-traffic areas or in areas more likely to
be visited by staff. <BR><BR>

 <LI><b>Choosing friends carefully</b>. Encourage your children to avoid
students who do not handle anger effectively. Ask your children to
be particularly careful with classmates who bring weapons to school
and to report any such incidents to their teachers.

<H3>How Can I Help Ensure Safety In My Child's School?</H3>

<P>As a parent, make it your responsibility to become as active in
your child's school as your schedule permits. Here are some
strategies you can use:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>

  <LI>Visit frequently, being sure to register with administrative
personnel when you arrive. Volunteer to help in your child's
classroom or elsewhere in the school as often as you can and
encourage other parents to visit and volunteer. The more parents
are involved and visible, the safer their children's schools will
be.

 <LI>Become a member of the school's Parent-Teacher Association (PTA)
or other parent-teacher organization. By attending meetings and
participating in its committees and activities, you'll become
acquainted with other parents and with school personnel.

<LI> Get to know your child's friends and their families. Productive
friendships and a sense of common purpose among students, teachers,
and neighbors make schools and neighborhoods safer.

<H3>Where Can I Find More Information About School Safety?</H3>

<P>In general, school personnel are excellent sources of information
and suggestions. You can also contact your state and national PTA
offices, local or state departments of education, or local public
or school district libraries for publications outlining school
safety practices, legislation, and helpful hints for creating a
safer school environment. The following organizations can also

<H4>Listen Better, Learn More </H4>

<P>In one of the Family Circus cartoon strips, the little girl looks up at her
father, who is reading the newspaper, and says:  "Daddy, you have to
listen to me with your eyes as well as your ears."  That statement says
almost all there is to say about listening, whether in our personal
conversations or in learning in school.</P>


<a name="Skills"></a>
<H4>Do Listening Skills Affect Learning? </H4>


<P>Listening is not a school subject like reading and writing.  Many of us
seem to feel it comes naturally and that as long as we can listen to
directions on how to find the restroom, nothing more needs to be said.
The latest studies reveal that listening is a very large part of school
learning and is one of our primary means of interacting with other people
on a personal basis.  It is estimated that between 50 and 75 percent of
students' classroom time is spent listening to the teacher, to other
students, or to audio media.</P>

<a name="Guide"></a>
<H3>Can Parents Guide Their Children To Better Listening? </H3>



<P>According to research on listening skills, being a good listener means
focusing attention on the message and reviewing the important
information.  Parents can model good listening behavior for their children
and advise them on ways to listen as an active learner, pick out
highlights of a conversation, and ask relevant questions.  Sometimes it
helps to "show" children that an active listener is one who looks the
speaker in the eye and is willing to turn the television off to make sure
that the listener is not distracted by outside interference.</P>


<a name="Guidelines"></a>
<H4>Guidelines For Modeling Good Listening Skills</H4>
<UL TYPE=DISC>


<LI><b>Be interested and attentive</b>.  Children can tell whether they have
      a parent's interest and attention by the way the parent replies or
      does not reply.  Forget about the telephone and other
      distractions.  Maintain eye contact to show that you really are
      with the child. <BR><BR>


<LI> <b>Encourage talking.</b>  Some children need an invitation to start
      talking.  You might begin with, "Tell me about your day at
      school."  Children are more likely to share their ideas and
      feelings when others think them important.<BR><BR>

<LI><b>   Listen patiently</b>.  People think faster than they speak.  With
      limited vocabulary and experience in talking, children often take
      longer than adults to find the right word.  Listen as though you
      have plenty of time.<BR><BR>

<LI><b>    Hear children out</b>.  Avoid cutting children off before they have
      finished speaking.  It is easy to form an opinion or reject
      children's views before they finish what they have to say.  It may
      be difficult to listen respectfully and not correct misconceptions,
      but respect their right to have and express their opinions.<BR><BR>

<LI><b>Listen to nonverbal messages.</B>  Many messages children send
      are communicated nonverbally by their tone of voice, their facial
      expressions, their energy level, their posture, or changes in their
      behavior patterns.  You can often tell more from the way a child
      says something than from what is said.  When a child comes in
      obviously upset, be sure to find a quiet time then or sometime
      that day to help explore those feelings.

<H3>Suggestions For Improving Communication With Children </H3>



<UL TYPE=DISC>


<LI><b>Be interested.</b>  Ask about children's ideas and opinions regularly.
      If you show your children that you are really interested in what
      they think, what they feel, and what their opinions are, they will
      become comfortable about expressing their thoughts to you.<BR><BR>

<LI><b>Avoid dead-end questions.  </b>Ask children the kinds of questions
      that will extend interaction rather than cut it off.  Questions that
      require a yes or no or right answer lead a conversation to a
      dead end.  Questions that ask children to describe, explain, or
      share ideas extend the conversation.<BR><BR>

<LI><b>     Extend conversation.</B>  Try to pick up a piece of your child's
      conversation.  Respond to his or her statements by asking a
      question that restates or uses some of the same words your
      child used.  When you use children's own phrasing or terms, you
      strengthen their confidence in their conversational and verbal
      skills and reassure them that their ideas are being listened to
      and valued.<BR><BR>

<LI><b>Share your thoughts.</b>Share what you are thinking with your
      child.  For instance, if you are puzzling over how to rearrange
      your furniture, get your child involved with questions such as,
      "I'm not sure where to put this shelf.  Where do you think would
      be a good place?"<BR><BR>

<LI><b> Observe signs.</b>  Watch the child for signs that it is time to end
      a conversation.  When a child begins to stare into space, give
      silly responses, or ask you to repeat several of your comments,
      it is probably time to stop the exchange.<BR><BR>

<LI><b> Reflect feelings. </b> One of the most important skills good listeners
      have is the ability to put themselves in the shoes of others or
      empathize with the speaker by attempting to understand his or
      her thoughts and feelings.  As a parent, try to mirror your
      children's feelings by repeating them.  You might reflect a child's
      feelings by commenting, "It sounds as if you're angry at your
      math teacher."  Restating or rephrasing what children have said
      is useful when they are experiencing powerful emotions that they
      may not be fully aware of.<BR><BR>

<LI><b>Help clarify and relate experiences. </b> As you listen, try to make
      your child's feelings clear by stating them in your own words.
      Your wider vocabulary can help children express themselves as
      accurately and clearly as possible and give them a deeper
      understanding of words and inner thoughts.

<H3>Why Are Parents Important In Building Children's Communication Skills? </H3>


<P>Parents play an essential role in building children's communication skills
because children spend more time with their parents than with any other
adult.  Children also have a deeper involvement with their parents than
with any other adult, and the family as a unit has lifelong contact with its
members.  Parents control many of the contacts a child has with society
as well as society's contacts with the child. </P>


<P>Adults, parents, and teachers set a powerful example of good or poor
communication.  Communication skills are influenced by the examples
children see and hear.  Parents and teachers who listen to their children
with interest, attention, and patience set a good example.  The greatest
audience children can have is an adult who is important to them and
interested in them.</P>

<P>   

<P>    NEW YORK, Nov. 21, 1996 -- Obesity in children may have as much to
do with what kids drink as it does with what they eat, a new report by The New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center's Nutrition Information Center finds.</P>

<P>    "Liquid intake seriously impacts the overall diet of American children,"
says report author Barbara Levine, Ph.D., R.D. and Director of New York-
Cornell's Nutrition Information Center.  "Pediatricians, nutritionists,
parents and care providers need to make every effort to teach children how to
make healthy beverage choices an essential part of a nutritious, well-balanced
diet."</P>

<P>    By 1994, the average teenager consumed 64.5 gallons of soft drink per
year, triple the amount consumed in 1978 (20.6 gallons).  On average, 75
percent of teenage boys drank almost three 12-ounce cans of soda per day, and
two-thirds of teenage girls drank approximately two cans, this according to
the 1994 United States Department of Agriculture survey, "What We Eat in
America."</P>

<P>    During the same period, soft drink consumption more than doubled in
children ages 6 to 11 and non-citrus juice (those other than 100% juice, like
apple &amp; grape based mixes) consumption among young children also tripled.</P>

<P>    "This dramatic rise in high calorie beverage consumption among children
and teens occurred during approximately the same years as did the most
significant increase in childhood and adolescent obesity," the report states.</P>

   <H3> Curing Obesity In Children Makes for Healthier Lives</H3>
    
<P>    While adulthood obesity has been well-documented, much less attention has
been given to childhood and adolescent obesity.  It is estimated that 21
percent of American children and adolescents ages 12 to 19 are obese.
According to the 1995 study "Childhood Obesity:  Pathophysiology and
Treatment," (Baylor College of Medicine) adolescent obesity is associated with
myriad factors, including; obese parents, a sedentary lifestyle, and young
children's tendency to eat away from home at a childcare center, a friend's
house and/or fast food restaurants.</P>

<P>    A number of negative health consequences have been attributed to improper
liquid nutrition including bone fractures which can lead to osteoporosis due
to deficient calcium intake as well as tooth decay and other tooth wear
problems such as tooth tissue loss due to excess sugar.  Dehydration,
especially during hot weather, is another serious risk.</P>

   <H3> Recommendations for Healthy Beverage Choices</H3>
   
<P>    "We believe it is time to help children and adolescents break the high
calorie fruit drink and soft drink habit," the report states and offers
several key suggestions that can make healthier beverages more tasteful,
available and enjoyable.</P>

<ul>
    <li> <B>Make Healthy Beverage Alternatives More Flavorful</B><br>
       Mix sparkling mineral water and fruit juice.  Diluting high-calorie
       fruit juices with water provides a refreshing beverage alternative. </p>

    <li> <B>Make Healthy Beverage Alternatives Easily Accessible</B><br>
       Keep refrigerated water and water-abundant fruits (watermelon, grapes,
       cantaloupe) easily accessible at home.  Place children's cups and
       drinking glasses near the home water cooler.
</p>
     <li> <B>Incorporate Substitutes Gradually</B><br>
       Substitute 100% juice for sugared drinks and place water in children's
       lunch boxes a few times during the week.</p>

   <li> <B>Make Healthy Beverage Alternatives Appealing</B><br>
       Beverage consumption is as much a social activity as a means to remain
       hydrated and quench thirst.  The very fact that bottled water can be
       purchased in single-serve bottles in a variety of flavors puts it in
       the same league with soft drinks.</p>
       </ul>
       

<P>    The new report appears in the November issue of Current Concepts and
Perspectives in Nutrition, the Center's journal.  Reprints of the report are
available free of charge by contacting New York-Cornell Nutrition Information
Center at 515 East 71 Street, New York, N.Y. 10021; 212-746-1617.
 </P> 
<P>   New York-Cornell's Nutrition Information Center serves as a resource for
gathering and disseminating accurate and current information in nutrition
research, clinical nutrition and basic nutrition principles to health
professionals, and ultimately to the general public.  The primary mission and
highest priority of New York-Cornell's Nutrition Information Center is to
serve as a resource for health professionals, keeping them up-to-date on
important developments in the field of nutrition.</P>

<P>    WASHINGTON, Nov. 22, 1996-- The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) today announced a comprehensive approach to preserve
the important safety benefit of air bags while minimizing their danger to
children and at-risk adults.</P>

<P>    The agency announced its approach centers on accelerating the development
of "smart air bag" technology for future vehicles with the intent of having
the systems available in fall 1998 for 1999 models.  More immediate measures
include adoption of enhanced warning labels, depowering of air bags and
continuing to allow the use of cut-off switches in vehicles without a rear
seat to protect children.</P>

<P>    NHTSA Administrator Ricardo Martinez, M.D., said, "The safety of the
motoring public is our highest priority.  Air bags are working well, but need
to be improved to enhance the safety of children and small stature adults.
These comprehensive measures will maintain the safety benefits of air bags,
decrease their potential hazard to children and at-risk adults, and provide
consumers with important safety information."</P>

<P>    Administrator Martinez added that while these steps will enhance the
safety of vehicle occupants in the interim, the effort can only be fully
completed with the development and use of "smart" air bag technology.</P>

<ul>
    <li> "Smart" air bags.  The agency will propose setting a phase-in schedule
for the next generation of air bags to begin in fall 1998 for 1999 models.
With the growth of research and competition in air bag technology, NHTSA
believes that "smart bags" will provide significantly greater safety in
frontal crash protection, and wants to encourage both their rapid development
and design flexibility.  Smart bags will effectively "tailor" the deployment
to the size of the occupant and the crash circumstances. </p>
</ul>

<P>    The other intermediate safety measures are:</P>
    
    <ul>
    <li> Improved warning labels.  The agency announced the adoption of a final
rule requiring new, highly visible warning labels for all new cars and light
trucks beginning in 90 days and in effect until "smart" air bags are
available.  The labels will be affixed to both sides of the sun visors making
them visible when the visors are either up or down.  In addition, new vehicles
will be required to have a prominent warning label affixed to the center of
the dashboard as a strong, clearly visible reminder at the time of delivery.
This label may only be removed by the vehicle owner. </p>

    A final rule also announced today requires a new, highly visible air bag
danger warning label on child safety seats.  The label will be affixed where
the child's head rests so that it can be seen readily by parents or others who
have child passengers in their vehicle. </p>

    <li> Depowering for safety.  NHTSA will propose that air bags be depowered
between 20-35 percent to reduce the deployment force for added safety.  Once
adopted, depowered air bags would be permitted until smart air bag technology
is phased into new cars.  NHTSA believes that this level of depowering will
reduce the incidence of injury and improve the performance of air bags for
belted occupants, including children, individuals with acute medical
conditions and small stature adults, while still providing significant
protection for unbelted occupants.  NHTSA will seek comments on its proposed
changes to the federal standards with the goal of modifying all new vehicles
within one year.</p>

   <li> Cutoff switches for vehicles with no rear seat.  NHTSA will issue
a final rule extending its existing policy of permitting manufacturers to
install manual cutoff switches in vehicles without a back seat, or with a back
seat that is too small to install a child safety seat.  A cutoff switch
enables the driver of a pickup truck, for example, to disable the air bag when
a child is in the passenger seat, and turn it back on for an adult passenger.</p>

    <li> Option for owners of air bag-equipped vehicles.  The agency will
propose allowing dealers to deactivate the air bags of any owner who requests
it.  Currently, NHTSA permits deactivation on a case-by-case basis.  The new
policy would permit families who need to have children in the front seat for
medical monitoring purposes, car pools with front-seated children,
short-stature individuals, and others who have reasonable concerns about a
potential danger to turn the air bag off.  Automobile dealers will be asked to
help their customers make informed decisions by providing them with NHTSA
guidance on the benefits and dangers of deactivating the air bag system, and
would be required to install a label indicating that the air bag has been
disabled.</p>

    <li> Increased public awareness. NHTSA will increase its own air bag public
awareness activities and coordinate them with information efforts underway by
the national Air Bag Safety Campaign, the coalition that it organized last
year involving car companies, insurers and safety groups.  It also plans a
national distribution of copies of a warning label, using state motor vehicle
offices, fast food chains, convenience stores and other outlets, and is using
its popular public service characters, "Vince and Larry," to help convey
information about air bag dangers as part of their seat belt message.</p>

   <li> Expanded research program.  NHTSA is also announcing an expanded
research program to improve the testing of air bags and crash protection for
children and women.  This program will lead to better dummy and vehicle
designs and improved safety standards.  Last week, NHTSA received the support
of the international research community, including government and industry
representatives, to place a priority on this needed research.</p>
</ul>

<P>    "The most important and immediate part of our strategy is that children
age 12 and under should always ride in the back seat, buckled up.  Regulatory
actions will make tomorrow's air bags safer for children, but too many are at
risk in the interim if parents do not insist their children ride in the back
seat," Dr. Martinez said.</P>

<P>    "Overall, air bags are working well and are responsible for an 11 percent
reduction in driver fatalities in passenger cars, including a 30 percent
reduction in fatalities in head-on crashes.  They are credited with saving
more than 1,500 lives since 1986 when they began appearing in the U.S. fleet,"
Dr. Martinez said.</P>

<P>    "Regarding our proposal to allow air bags to be disconnected, we expect
that very few will need to take this extreme action, and those who do will be
made aware of the risks involved," Dr. Martinez said.  "You can greatly reduce
the risk of air bag injury by being buckled and back from the air bag."</P>

<P>    NHTSA has aggressively issued consumer advisories and worked with the news
media, the highway safety community, auto and insurance industries, and the
medical community to increase public awareness of both the problem and the
immediate solution -- placing children in the back seat, buckled up.</P>

<P>    In August 1996, the agency proposed changes to the federal air bag
requirement to encourage the introduction of "smart" air bag systems and to
provide relief to owners of existing vehicles equipped with air bags.</P>

<P>    The Congress in 1991 directed NHTSA to amend the standard to require air
bags for all new cars manufactured after September 1997 and for light trucks
the following year.  Responding to market demand, manufacturers exceeded that
timetable and today virtually all new cars and trucks offer dual air bags.</P>

<P>    Consumers who have questions or concerns about air bags should contact the
agency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at 800-424-9393.  For up-to-date

Federalsafety standards require that all new passenger cars and light trucks be equippedwith both driver- and passenger-side air bags by 1999. While air bags have agood overall safety record and have saved an estimated 1200 lives as of the endof 1995, they pose several risks for children.</P><P>An infant in a rear-facing safety seat must never be placed in the front seat of amotor vehicle with a passenger-side air bag. During a forward impact, the rapidlyinflating air bag could strike the safety seat with enough force to seriously injureor kill the infant. Infants under one year of age and under about 20 pounds mustride in a rear-facing safety seat placed in the back seat of the vehicle, especially ifthe vehicle is equipped with a passenger-side air bag.</P><P>Forward-facing safety seats, as used with toddlers and older children, typicallyplace children at least several inches closer to the dashboard than the normal adultseating position. Therefore, the safest practice is to place all child safety seats inthe back seat of the vehicle. If it is absolutely necessary to place a forward-facingsafety seat in the front of a vehicle with a passenger-side air bag, the vehicle seatshould be adjusted as far back as possible from the dashboard.</P><P>Air bags pose special hazards for any children who ride unrestrained orincorrectly restrained in the front seat. Like all occupants, children should alwaysbe properly restrained in safety seats or safety belts. Unfortunately, surveysindicate that as many as 35 percent of young children ride unrestrained. Pre-crashbraking may throw an unrestrained child against the dashboard at or near thepassenger air bag location. When this happens, the inflating air bag and its plasticcover can violently impact the out-of-place child with such force that it can injureor even kill the child. The safest place for all children is correctly restrained in theback seat of the vehicle.</P><P>To ensure that your children ride safely, remember these rules:</P><ul>       <li>The back seat is the safest place for children of any age to ride. </p>       <li>Never put an infant (less than one year old) in the front of a car with a       passenger-side air bag. </p>       <li>Infants must always ride in the back seat facing the rear of the car.</p>        <li>Make sure everyone is buckled up.Unbuckled occupants can be hurt or       killed by an air bag. </p>       </ul><hr><a name="credits"></a><h3>Credits</h3><P>For more information regarding children and air bags, call NHTSA's toll-freeAuto Safety Hotline at 1-800-424-9393 or visit their web site at<a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov">http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov</a> or write to:</P><Blockquote><p>Child Safety Seats<br>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration<br>400 7th Street, S.W., NTS-13<br>Washington, DC 20590 </p></blockquote></td></tr></table><hr><center><h4><a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> |<a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |<A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |<a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center><img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left><address>We love to talk with you.

That blast of energy can severely hurt orkill passengers and drivers who are too close to the air bag.  An infant's head in arear-facing safety seat is directly in front of the air bag as it breaks through thedashboard and instantly inflates.  Even some forward facing child safety seats could possiblyplace the child within range of  the air bag before it is fully inflated.  Also, if a childis unbelted, or too small for the lap and shoulder belt to fit properly, or wriggling aroundor leaning forward, there is a danger that the child will be too close to the dashboardduring that instant that the air bag begins to inflate.<hr><H3>Importance Of Safety Belts</H3><P><B>Question: </B>How can an air bag work so well for adults, but hurt children in the frontpassenger seat?<P><B>Answer: </B>An average size adult who is correctly belted is not likely to come incontact with the air bag until it is fully inflated. A fully inflated air bag spreads theforces of the crash across a wide area of the body.  Even an unbelted adult will probablycome in contact with the air bag at the chest area after the bag has at least partiallyinflated.  For greatest protection, both the driver and front passengers should be buckledup and the seats moved back as far as practical to allow ample space for the air bag toexpand.<p>Unbelted or improperly belted children can easily slide off the seat during pre-crashbraking, throwing them against the dashboard where the air bag can strike them on the heador neck with tremendous force before it is fully inflated.<p>The air bag only inflates in front end crashes and collapses immediately. For protectionin all types of collisions -- multiple, rollover, rear end, side and front end -- it isvery important to always use both lap and shoulder belts.<hr><H3>The Back Seat Is The Safest Seat</H3><P><B>Question: </B>Why are children safer in the back seat?</P><P><B>Answer: </B>The rear seat is the safest seat for any passenger. Head-on crashes causethe greatest number of serious injuries.  A person sitting in the back seat is farthestaway from the impact and less likely to be injured.  People sitting in the rear have thesoft back of the front seat in front of them, instead of hard surfaces like the windshield,mirror or dashboard.<p>If it is absolutely necessary for a child age 12 or under to ride in the front seat of acar with a passenger side air bag, secure the child in a restraint system that is correctfor the size of the child -- a front-facing child safety seat, a booster seat, or alap/shoulder belt -- AND move the front seat as far back away from the dashboard aspossible.<p>If the vehicle has no back seat, such as a pickup truck, an infant will be safe in arear-facing child seat only if the vehicle does not have a passenger side air bag or if ithas a cutoff switch for the passenger side air bag.<p>In summary, people riding in the front seat who are most likely to be injured or killedby an inflating air bag are:<UL><p><LI> infants riding in rear-facing car seats;<p><LI> children age 12 and under who are not properly secured in arestraint system that is appropriate for their size -- a forward facing safety seat,booster seat, or correct fitting lap and shoulder belt;<p><LI> children or adults who are not buckled up;<p><LI> children or adults who place the shoulder belt either behind theirback or under their arm; and<p><LI> persons sitting too close to the steering wheel or dashboard sothat they come into contact with the air bag before it is fully inflated. </UL><hr><H3>Being Smothered By an Air Bag is a Myth </H3><P><B>Question: </B>Is it true that a passenger can be smothered by an airbag?</P><P><B>Answer: </B>No! The injuries that occur are caused by the inflatingbag hitting the head and neck of an out-of-position passenger or the inflatingbag hitting the back of an infant seat behind a baby's head. The air bagloses its air right after it inflates, so the stiff fabric does not remainover the passenger's face. </P><hr><H3>Turning an Infant Seat Around</H3><P><B>Question:</B> When parents learn that an air bag can harm a baby ina rear-facing infant seat, many of them want to place the baby facing forward.Is this okay?</P><P><B>Answer:</B> No! Infants must always ride facing the rear in the backseat.</P><P>Both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) warn that babies should ride facingthe back until they are at least one year old and weigh at least 20 pounds.A child under age one does not have strong neck muscles; the head wouldsnap forward in a crash if the baby were facing forward. This could causeserious neck and spinal cord injury.</P><P>When the child is facing the back, the force of the crash is spread acrossthe whole body. The child seat harness must be snug, and the seat shouldbe at a 45-degree angle to support the baby's head and maintain an openairway. Some safety seats have an indicator on the side to show the correctangle. A child seat that installs in a position that is too upright canbe angled properly by using a firmly rolled sheet or towel under the footof the seat.</P><hr><H3>Need to Be Able to See Baby While Driving</H3><P><B>Question: </B>Many parents don't want to put their infants in theback seat because they cannot see them. Shouldn't a parent keep an eye onthe baby to make sure it is not choking or<BR>experiencing some other health problem?</P><P><B>Answer: </B>The risk of a serious injury in a crash is much greaterthan the risk of a healthy baby having a life-threatening problem duringa car ride. A healthy baby correctly buckled in a rear-facing child seatshould be as safe as a child placed in a crib for a nap or an overnightsleep. Parents do not stay in the room to watch a sleeping baby.</P><P>Drivers traveling with children should always allow plenty of time topull off the road if they are concerned about the baby or need to tend tothe child's needs.</P><hr><H3>Using Only the Lap Portion of a Lap/Shoulder BeltSystem</H3><P><B>Question:</B> If a child is too small to wear a shoulder belt correctly,will the lap belt protect the child from an air bag?</P><P><B>Answer:</B> No. If a child uses only the lap portion of a safety belt,his or her upper body will be thrown forward when the driver brakes or duringthe crash itself. The inflating bag will strike the child's head and neckvery hard.</P><P>Whether in the front seat or rear seat, children can suffer serious orfatal injuries if they wear a shoulder belt wrong, such as under the armor behind the back. A child who is too short for the shoulder belt (forexample, the belt cuts across the neck or face) should always use a convertibleor toddler safety seat (if the child is under 40 pounds and 40 inches) ora belt-positioning booster seat (if the child is over 40 pounds and 40 inches).Remember that a belt-positioning booster seat must be used with both thelap and shoulder belts, preferably in the rear seat, which is always saferthan the front seat.</P><hr><H3>Identifying Vehicles with Air Bags</H3><P><B>Question: </B>How can a driver or passenger tell whether a vehiclehas an air bag?</P><P><B>Answer:</B> Vehicles with air bags have one or more of the followingmarkings: </P><UL>  <LI>the words &quot;Air Bag&quot; or the letters &quot;SRS&quot; (Supplemental  Restraint System) or &quot;SIR&quot; (Supplemental Inflatable Restraint)  on the steering wheel and dashboard panel.</LI>  <LI>a warning label on the sun visors or on the sides of the open door  frame.</LI>  <LI>a warning in the vehicle owner's manual.</LI></UL><P>Consult the owner's manual to find information about carrying childrensafely in a vehicle equipped with an air bag.<hr><a name="credits"></a><h3>Credits</h3><P>This FAQ courtesy of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration </P><P> Consumers who have questions or concerns about air bags should contact theagency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at 800-424-9393.

<P>    PENNSAUKEN, N.J., Nov. 15, 1996 -- J &amp; J Snack Foods Corp. is
recalling frozen SUPERPRETZEL(R) SOFTSTIX(R) Cheese Filled Soft Pretzel Sticks
in CHEDDAR flavor because they may contain undeclared peanut butter and jelly
spread.  People who have allergies to peanuts run the risk of serious or life
threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products.</P>

<P>    Frozen Cheddar Cheese Filled SOFTSTIX(R) were distributed through retail
supermarkets.  The areas possibly affected include: North Dakota, South
Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri,
Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania,
Upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.</P>

<P>    The product can be identified by the code number 092197 A or B embossed on
the top long, sealed flap immediately above the main panel.</P>

<P>    No illnesses or allergic reactions have been reported to date, although
there have been several reports of the mislabeled product.</P>

<P>    The recall was initiated after two consumer calls were received indicating
the presence of peanut butter and jelly spread instead of cheddar cheese
filling.  Subsequent investigation revealed no more than 100 cases (1,200
individual boxes) were inadvertently packed with peanut butter and jelly
spread filling.</P>

<P>    J &amp; J representatives are in the process of removing appropriate product
from store freezers.  Consumers who find this product may return it to the
store where it was purchased or call 1-800-989-9534, extension 1-309.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC), Century Products Company of Macedonia,Ohio, is voluntarily providing a free repair kit for about 212,000 Century Fold-N-Go Model 10-710 and 10-810 Travel Playards
(also known as playpens). The top rails on these playards may
collapse unexpectedly, trapping a child at the neck in the "V"
formed by the collapsed top rail.  </P>

<P>An 18-month-old boy died recently in Centreville, Va., when a
Century playard collapsed. The Fairfax County, Va., Police
Department provided information to CPSC regarding the death.</P>

<P>Century is offering a free repair kit, consisting of new Posi-
Locks  top rails to prevent the rails from collapsing when a
child is in the playard. This kit can be installed in the home
using a Phillips head screwdriver. </P>

<P>The Century Model 10-710, measuring 26 inches by 38 inches, was
sold in Toys R Us stores beginning in June 1994 for about $50.
The Model 10-810, measuring 28 inches by 41 inches, was sold
nationwide beginning in February 1993 in juvenile products and
discount stores for about $80. Both models fold compactly and fit
into an accompanying nylon case for storing and carrying. The
model number is located on a label on the floor or on one of the
support tubes under the floor. All Century Fold-N-Go Models 10-
710 and 10-810 are part of this recall. Other Century Fold-N-Go
models have different top rails and are not being recalled.</P>

<P>Consumers with either a Century Model 10-710 or Model 10-810
Fold-N-Go Playard should stop using the product immediately and
call Century at (800) 541-0264 for a free repair kit and
installation instructions or write to Century Products Company,
9600 Valley View Road, Macedonia, OH 44056. Consumers should not
use the playard until the new top rails are installed. </P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. -  In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC),  So's U.S.A. Company Inc.
of Los Angeles is voluntarily recalling over 170,000
bottles of Wood Lock Medicated Balm, imported from China.
The product, containing more than five percent of methyl
salicylate, does not have the required child resistant
packaging.  Methyl Salicylate can poison young children if
ingested, seriously injuring or killing them.
    </P> 
<P>CPSC and So's are not aware of any injuries involving
this product. This recall is being conducted to prevent the
possibility of injury.
    </P> 
<P>Consumers use the medicated balm, packaged in .85- and
1.7-fluid-ounce glass bottles with black plastic caps, to
relieve muscle aches and pains. A label on the bottle reads
in part, "WOOD LOCK   Medicated Balm," with Chinese
characters and a photo of a man's face in the center.
    </P> 
<P>Drug stores, health food stores, Chinese groceries, and
health stores sold the balm in California and Oregon from
1994 through July 1996 for approximately $2.30 for the
.85-oz. bottle and $3.45 for the 1.7-oz. bottle.
    </P> 
<P>Consumers should return the balm to the store where
purchased for a full refund. For more information, consumers
should call So's toll-free at (888) 221-3496 from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m PST.
    </P> 
<P>The Food and Drug Administration referred this matter
to CPSC.
    </P> 
<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death from
15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's
fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772
or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To order a press
release through fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051 from the
handset of your fax machine and enter the release number.
Consumers can obtain this release and recall information at
CPSC's web site at <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov">http://www.cpsc.gov</a> or via Internet

<P>Most parents want their young children to have a healthy sense of
self-esteem. That desire can also be seen in education--schools around the
country include self-esteem among their goals. Many observers believe that
low self-esteem lies at the bottom of many of society's problems. </P>

<P>Even though self-esteem has been studied for more than 100 years,
specialists and educators continue to debate its precise nature and
development. Nevertheless, they generally agree that parents and other
adults who are important to children play a major role in laying a solid
foundation for a child's development. </P>
 <HR>
 <a name="Self"></a>
<H3>What Is Self-Esteem?</H3>


<P>When parents and teachers of young children talk about the need for good
self-esteem, they usually mean that children should have "good feelings"
about themselves. With young children, self-esteem refers to the extent to
which they expect to be accepted and valued by the adults and peers who
are important to them.
    </P>
<P>Children with a healthy sense of self-esteem feel that the important
adults in their lives accept them, care about them, and would go out of
their way to ensure that they are safe and well. They feel that those
adults would be upset if anything happened to them and would miss them if
they were separated. Children with low self-esteem, on the other hand,
feel that the important adults and peers in their lives do not accept
them, do not care about them very much, and would not go out of their way
to ensure their safety and well-being.  </P>

<P>During their early years, young children's self-esteem is based largely on
their perceptions of how the important adults in their lives judge them.
The extent to which children believe they have the characteristics valued
by the important adults and peers in their lives figures greatly in the
development of self-esteem. For example, in families and communities that
value athletic ability highly, children who excel in athletics are likely
to have a high level of self-esteem, whereas children who are less
athletic or who are criticized as being physically inept or clumsy are
likely to suffer from low self-esteem.
    </P>
<P>Families, communities, and ethnic and cultural groups vary in the criteria
on which self-esteem is based. For example, some groups may emphasize
physical appearance, and some may evaluate boys and girls differently.
Stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination are also factors that may
contribute to low self-esteem among children. </P>

<HR>

    <a name="Develop"></a>
<H3>How Can We Help Children Develop a Healthy Sense of Self-Esteem? </H3>


<P>The foundations of self-esteem are laid early in life when infants develop
attachments with the adults who are responsible for them. When adults
readily respond to their cries and smiles, babies learn to feel loved and
valued. Children come to feel loved and accepted by being loved and
accepted by people they look up to. As young children learn to trust their
parents and others who care for them to satisfy their basic needs, they
gradually feel wanted, valued, and loved. </P>

<P>Self-esteem is also related to children's feelings of belonging to a group
and being able to adequately function in their group. When toddlers become
preschoolers, for example, they are expected to control their impulses and
adopt the rules of the family and community in which they are growing.
Successfully adjusting to these groups helps to strengthen feelings of
belonging to them. </P>

<P>One point to make is that young children are unlikely to have their
self-esteem strengthened from excessive praise or flattery. On the
contrary, it may raise some doubts in children; many children can see
through flattery and may even dismiss an adult who heaps on praise as a
poor source of support--one who is not very believable. </P>

<P>The following points may be helpful in strengthening and supporting a
healthy sense of self-esteem in your child: </P>


<P><b>As they grow, children become increasingly sensitive to the evaluations
of their peers</b>. You and your child's teachers can help your child learn to
build healthy relationships with his or her peers. </P>

<P><b>When children develop stronger ties with their peers in school or around
the neighborhood, they may begin to evaluate themselves differently from
the way they were taught at home</b>. You can help your child by being clear
about your own values and keeping the lines of communication open about
experiences outside the home.
    </P>

<P><b>Children do not acquire self-esteem at once nor do they always feel good
about themselves in every situation</b>. A child may feel self-confident and
accepted at home but not around the neighborhood or in a preschool class.
Furthermore, as children interact with their peers or learn to function in
school or some other place, they may feel accepted and liked one moment
and feel different the next. You can help in these instances by reassuring
your child that you support and accept him or her even while others do
not. </P>

<P><b>A child's sense of self-worth is more likely to deepen when adults
respond to the child's interests and efforts with appreciation rather than
just praise</b>. For example, if your child shows interest in something you
are doing, you might include the child in the activity. Or if the child
shows interest in an animal in the garden, you might help the child find
more information about it. In this way, you respond positively to your
child's interest by treating it seriously. Flattery and praise, on the
contrary, distract children from the topics they are interested in.
Children may develop a habit of showing interest in a topic just to
receive flattery. </P>

<P><b>Young children are more likely to benefit from tasks and activities that
offer a real challenge than from those that are merely frivolous or fun. </b>
For example, you can involve your child in chores around the house, such
as preparing meals or caring for pets, that stretch his or her abilities
and give your child a sense of accomplishment. </P>

<P><b>Self-esteem is most likely to be fostered when children are esteemed by
the adults who are important to them</b>. To esteem children means to treat
them respectfully, ask their views and opinions, take their views and
opinions seriously, and give them meaningful and realistic feedback. </P>


<P><b>You can help your child develop and maintain healthy self-esteem by
helping him or her cope with defeats, rather than emphasizing constant
successes and triumphs</b>. During times of disappointment or crisis, your
child's weakened self-esteem can be strengthened when you let the child
know that your love and support remain unchanged. When the crisis has
passed, you can help your child reflect on what went wrong. The next time
a crisis occurs, your child can use the knowledge gained from overcoming
past difficulties to help cope with a new crisis. A child's sense of
self-worth and self-confidence is not likely to deepen when adults deny
that life has its ups and downs.</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>


<P>Parents can play an important role in strengthening children's self-esteem
by treating them respectfully, taking their views and opinions seriously,
and expressing appreciation to them. Above all, parents must keep in mind
that self-esteem is an important part of every child's development.

<P>Children who are "gifted" demonstrate a high
performance capability in intellectual, creative,
or artistic areas, leadership ability, or specific
academic fields. This brochure discusses early
steps parents and their gifted children can take to
prepare for college and to ensure that the college
experience is positive. </P>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Characteristics of Gifted Students May Affect
College Planning?</H3>

<P><b>Multiple talents (sometimes called
multitalentedness or multipotentiality).</b> Gifted
students often have a wide variety of interests,
and they may miss opportunities by focusing too
early on one academic area. Encourage your child to
explore all of the possibilities for his or her
talents. </P>


<P><b>Idealistic thinking. </b>Gifted students often want
to find solutions to global problems and become
deeply invested in exploring ideas to their limits.
To sustain that interest, your child needs strong
academic support. In college, he or she will
benefit from stimulating courses that integrate
disciplines. </P>

<P><b>Sensitivity to expectations. </b>Gifted children tend
to be very sensitive to the expectations of their
parents and teachers. To avoid creating feelings of
guilt or underachievement, be sure to give your
child options and a strong say in every
college-related decision that is made. </P>

<P><b>Isolation from other gifted students.</b>Many gifted
students are not challenged academically by their
peers in high school and enter college unprepared
for competition from other gifted students.
Emphasize that learning--not getting the highest
grades in the class--is what college is about. </P>


<a name="When"></a>
<H3>When Should Gifted Children Begin Preparing for
College?</H3>

<P>By 7th or 8th grade, many gifted children have
departed from their schools' traditional
age-in-grade groupings. These students need a broad
range of academic options--such as advanced
placement courses--to supplement their high school
curriculum. This is a good time to begin thinking
about and preparing your child for the important
decisions he or she soon will face. </P>

<P>Some gifted children are not prepared adequately
for college because counseling programs differ so
much from district to district. To better prepare
every gifted child, a program based on the
following sequence should begin early in
adolescence:</P>

<P><b> Seventh and eighth grades:</b> Emphasis on
self-awareness, time management, work/study skills,
and career awareness. Students design a preliminary
academic plan that includes courses required by the
state and those required for college. </P>

<P><b> Ninth and tenth grades: </b>Emphasis on decision
making and goal setting. Students identify and
pursue their interests and learn how their academic
talents, values, and goals relate to possible
careers. Students begin to recognize that some
talents develop into vocational pursuits while
others develop into leisure activities.</P>

<P><b> Eleventh and twelfth grades: </b>Emphasis on the
practical aspects of college and career planning,
including the college application process, exposure
to occupations and job internships, and mentor
relationships. </P>

<hr>
<a name="How"></a>
<H3>How Can Gifted Children Explore Possible Career Paths?</H3>



<P>Because they have such a broad range of interests
and abilities, some gifted students have difficulty
deciding on a career path. Most colleges, however,
expect students to decide on a course of study by
their third year. You can help by taking these
steps:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Expose your child to a variety of work environments.

	<LI>Ask open-ended questions when your child mentions
	careers and avoid statements that imply expectations.

	<LI>Urge your child to explore as many careers as possible.

	<LI>Encourage your child to volunteer in your community.

	<LI>Encourage your child to join high school internship programs.
</UL>


<a name="Appropriate"></a>
<H3>How Can I Help My Gifted Child Find an Appropriate
College?</H3>



Having the right kind of information about colleges
will help your child make the best decision about
where to go and what to study. Use the following
suggestions to guide your research:

<UL TYPE=DISC>

<LI> Start with information in the school guidance
office and library. Become familiar with college
guides, multimedia resources, and videotapes.<BR><BR>

<LI> Obtain literature from your top 15 to 20 choices
and read it carefully. Organize important
information, such as the colleges' goals,
recruitment procedures, support for incoming
freshmen, location, size, cost, academic life,
course offerings, honors programs, faculty, grading
policies, selection of applicants, and availability
of financial aid. Narrow your list to 5 to 10
colleges.<BR><BR>

<LI>  Visit campuses and talk to admission personnel,
faculty, and students about academic and campus
life.

<P>Parents of children with disabilities have a vital role to play in  the
education of their children. This fact is guaranteed in federal  legislation
that specifies the right of parents to participate in the  educational
decision-making process. As your child progresses  through educational systems,
knowing and following through on  your rights and responsibilities ensures that
you are a  contributing partner with professionals who will influence your
child's future. This brochure provides you with an introduction  to your rights
and responsibilities in the special education  process.   </P>

<HR>
<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Are Your Rights in the Special Education Process?</H3>



<P>Public Law 101-476 (IDEA) clearly defines the rights of  children with
disabilities and their parents. A basic provision of  the law is the right of
parents to participate in the educational  decision-making process. Your rights,
more specifically, include  the following:
</P>

<P><B>  Your child is entitled to a free, appropriate public education</B>
meaning it is at no cost to you as parents, and it meets the unique
educational needs of your child.  </P>

<P><B>  You will be notified whenever the school wishes to  evaluate your
child</B>, wants to change your child's educational placement, or refuses
your request for an evaluation or a change in placement.</P>

<P><b>  You may request an evaluation</B> if you think your child needs
special education or related services.</P>


<P><b>  You should be asked by your school to provide &quot;parent
consent&quot;</B>
meaning you understand and agree in writing to the evaluation and initial
special education placement for your child. Your consent is voluntary and
may be withdrawn at any time.  </P>


<P><b>You may obtain an independent evaluation</B> if you disagree
with the outcome of the school's evaluation.</P>

<P><b>    You may request a reevaluation </B>if you suspect your child's
current educational placement is no longer appropriate. The     school must
reevaluate your child at least every 3 years, but     your child's educational
program must be reviewed at least     once during each calendar year.</P>


<P><b>  You may have your child tested in the language</B> he or she     knows
best. For example, if your child's primary language is Spanish, he or she
must be tested in Spanish. Also, students who are hearing impaired have the
right to an interpreter during the testing.</P>


<P><b>The school must communicate with you in your primary  language.</B>The
school is required to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that you
understand its oral and written communication, including arranging for an
interpreter if you are hearing impaired or if your primary language is not
English </P>


<P><b>  You may review all of your child's records</B> and obtain     copies
of these records, but the school may charge you a     reasonable fee for making
copies. Only you, as parents, and     those persons directly involved in the
education of your child     will be given access to personal records. If you
feel any of     the information in your child's records is inaccurate,
misleading, or violates the privacy or other rights of your     child, you may
request that the information be changed. If     the school refuses your request,
you then have the right to     request a hearing to challenge the questionable
information in     your child's records.</P>

<P><b>  You must be fully informed by the school of all the rights</B>
provided to you and your child under the law.</P>

<P><b>  You may participate in the development of your child's Individualized
Education Program (IEP)</B> or, in the case of a child under
school age, the development of an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP).
The IEP and IFSP are written statements of the educational program designed
to meet your child's unique needs. The school must make every possible
effort to notify you of the IEP or IFSP meeting and arrange it at a time and
place agreeable to you. As an important member of the team, you may attend
the IEP or     IFSP meeting and share your ideas about your child's special
needs, the type of program appropriate to meeting those     needs, and the
related services the school will provide to help your child benefit from
his or her educational program. </P>

<P><b>  You may have your child educated in the least restrictive school
setting possible. </B>Every effort should be made to develop an educational
program that will provide the greatest amount of contact with children who
are not disabled.</P>

<P><b>    You may request a due process hearing</B> to resolve differences
with the school that could not be resolved informally.</P>

<a name="Special"></a>
<H3>What Are Your Responsibilities in the Special Education Process?</H3>


<P> Parental responsibilities to ensure that a child's rights are being
protected
are less clearly defined than are parental rights. These  responsibilities vary
depending on the child's disabling condition  and other factors. Some of the
following suggestions may be  helpful:   </P>

<P><b>    Develop a partnership with the school or agency.</B> You are     now
an important member of the team. Share relevant     information about your
child's education and development.     Your observations and suggestions can be
a valuable resource     to aid your child's progress.</P>

<P><b>    Learn as much as you can about your rights and the     rights of
your child.</B> Ask the school to explain these rights     as well as the
regulations in effect for your district and state     before you agree to a
special education program for your     child. Contact disability organizations
for their publications     on special education rights.</P>

<P><b>     Ask for clarification of any aspect of the program that is
unclear to you.</B>Educational and medical terms can be     confusing, so do not
hesitate to ask.</P>

<P><b>     Make sure you understand the program specified on the     IEP or
IFSP before agreeing to it or signing it.</B> Ask yourself if what is
planned corresponds with your knowledge of your child's needs.</P>

<P><b>      Consider how your child might be included in the regular
school activities program.</B> Do not forget areas such as lunch, recess,
art, music, and physical education.<P> </P>


<P><b>  Monitor your child's progress.</B> If your child is not
progressing, discuss it with the teacher and determine whether the program
should be modified. As a parent, you can initiate review of your child's
educational program.</P>

<P> <B>Discuss with the school or agency any problems that may
 occur with your child's assessment, placement, or educational program. </B>
 It is best to try to resolve problems directly with the agency or school.
In some situations, you     may be
uncertain as to how you should resolve a problem. All states have advocacy
agencies that can usually provide you with the guidance you need to pursue
your case.</P>


<P><B>Keep records. </B>There may be many questions and comments     about your
child that you will want to discuss, as well as     meetings and phone
conversations you will want to     remember. It is easy to forget information
useful to your     child's development and education if it is not written
down.</P>


<P> <B> Join a parent
organization.</B> In addition to the opportunity to     share knowledge and
support, a parent group can be an     effective force on behalf of your child.
Many times parents     find that as a group they have the power to bring about
  needed changes that strengthen special services.</P>


  <HR>
<a name="Offer"></a>
<H3>What Can You Offer the IEP or IFSP Process?  </H3>



<P>        In the final analysis, parents of children with
disabilities should  be involved in the IEP or IFSP process as much as they want
to  be and as much as they can be. The following are suggestions  for ways
parents can become involved:</P>



<P><B>Before attending an IEP or IFSP meeting, make
a list of things you want your child to learn.</b></P>

<P> <B>   Bring any information the school or agency may not already have
to the IEP or IFSP meeting.</b>
Examples include copies of medical records, past school records, and
test and medical evaluation results.</P>

<P><B>    Discuss what related services your
child may need.</b> Your child may need to be involved with many other
specialists and professionals besides his or her teacher, including
occupational therapists, physical therapists, or speech-language
pathologists.</P>

<P> <B> Discuss what assistive technology devices or services your
  child may need and have these listed in your child's IEP     or IFSP.</b> </P>

<P>    <B>    Ask what you can do at home to support the program.     </b>
</P>

<P>    <B>    Make sure the goals
and objectives listed in the IEP or IFSP are specific and measurable.</b></P>

<P> <B>    Periodically, ask for a report on your child's progress.</b>
</P>
<P>  <B>      Regard your
child's education as a cooperative effort. </b>If,     at any point, you and the
school cannot reach an agreement over your child's educational and
developmental needs, ask to have another meeting. Remember, compromise on
your part     and the school's or agency's part may be important in
resolving conflicts and maintaining a good working     relationship. If, after a
second meeting, there is still a     conflict over your child's program, you may
wish to ask for     a state mediator or a due process hearing.</P>

<a name="Resources"></a>
<H3>What Resources Are Available?</H3>




Many organizations have information to help guide
you through  the special education process. Since the specific criteria and
procedures used by school districts vary, it is important to  familiarize
yourself with the information provided by state and  local agencies. You will
find your local school district's director  of special education and his or her
staff helpful in accessing  such information and guiding you through the
process. <p>    Additional resources are available from national disability
organizations. Some of them have state and local chapters that  can provide more
locally based support. All states now have  federally supported parent
information and training centers. The  contacts cited below may be able to help
you locate such a  center in your state:

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), the Dolgencorp Inc. of Scottsville, Ky., is recalling
73,300 "Kid's Phone Beeper Combo" toys. The toy's telephone antenna and
pieces of plastic from around the base of the antenna can break off,
presenting a choking hazard to children under age 3.
    </P> 
<P>CPSC and Dolgencorp Inc. are not aware of any injuries involving these toy
telephones. The recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of
injury.
    </P> 
<P>The toy (item number 63305/7-S) consists of a plastic cellular telephone
and a beeper packaged together. The telephone, measuring 6 inches high by
2.5 inches wide, is made of yellow and white plastic with a red colored
plastic flip-down bottom and blue trim.  The beeper, made of white plastic
with yellow, red, and blue trim, measures 3.5 inches by 2.5 inches. Push
buttons on both cause flashing lights, making either telephone or beeper
sounds.
    </P> 
<P>The toy telephone and beeper are packaged together in a cardboard box
labeled in part, "KID'S PHONE BEEPER COMBO...ITEM NO. 63305/7-S."
Dolgencorp distributed the toys in Dollar General  stores in the central
part of the country from mid-August to mid-September 1996 for $5 retail. 
    </P> 
<P>Consumers should take the toy telephones away from young children
immediately and return them to their nearest Dollar General  store for a
full refund. For more information, call Ken Smith of Dolgencorp Inc. at
(502) 237-5444, Ext. 5326.
    </P> 
<P>CPSC learned of this problem during joint surveillance with the U.S.
Customs Service.
    </P>

<P>    KALAMAZOO, Mich., Nov. 12, 1996 -- Pharmacia &amp;  Upjohn Consumer
Healthcare, the makers of Kaopectate, announced today the introduction of
Kao Lectrolyte, an electrolyte replenisher formulated to appeal to children's
taste buds.</P>

<P>    Kao Lectrolyte, an over-the-counter product, is designed to prevent
dehydration due to diarrhea or vomiting in children from infancy through six
years of age.  These symptoms are a common result of colds or the flu.
Electrolyte replenishers, a combination of water, minerals and carbohydrates,
enable the body to recover more quickly from fluid loss.</P>

<P>    "We developed Kao Lectrolyte as a good-tasting product that children will
take more willingly than the current offerings so they will feel better," said
Charlene Crandell, Pharmacia &amp;  Upjohn Consumer Healthcare product manager for
Kao Lectrolyte.  "Electrolyte solutions won't help if children won't take
them."</P>

<P>    Kao Lectrolyte comes in two flavors, grape and bubble gum.  In national
taste tests, children preferred Kao Lectrolyte's grape and bubble gum flavored
liquids over Pedialyte's grape and bubble gum flavored liquids by nearly
3 to 1.  Kao Lectrolyte is also available in unflavored for infants, to be
used under a physician's guidance.</P>

<P>    Kao Lectrolyte is packaged in four single-serving packets of premeasured
powder that parents mix with water.  "Unlike pre-mixed replenishers that must
be discarded within 48 hours after being opened, Kao Lectrolyte's unopened
packets have a three-year shelf life," said Crandell.  "The introduction of
Kao Lectrolyte means that parents won't have to run out in the middle of the
night when their child is sick and won't have to throw away unused electrolyte
replenisher because it's gone bad after one use."</P>

<P>    Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluid than it is able to take
in as a result of vomiting or diarrhea, upsetting the balance of fluids and
salts that is normally maintained.  This is a particular threat to infants and
small children, whose loss of fluids is greater in proportion to their body
weight than older children.  Also, they are unable to communicate their lack
of fluids effectively.</P>

<P>    Warning signs of possible dehydration include dry mouth, lethargy, no
tears when crying and decreased urination.  In infants, the signs also include
failure to produce a wet diaper or a sunken soft spot on the top of the head.
For children under two years of age, parents should consult their pediatrician
before feeding Kao Lectrolyte.  Also, parents should consult their
pediatrician if a child's illness persists.</P>

<P>    Pharmacia &amp;  Upjohn, Inc., is a research-based pharmaceutically focused
company dedicated to helping people around the world live longer and fuller
lives.  The company was formed through a merger of Pharmacia AB and The Upjohn
Company and began operating in November 1995.  Pharmacia Upjohn is a provider
of human health care and related products, and operates on a global basis.
The Company has a corporate management center in London and major research and
manufacturing centers in the United States, Sweden and Italy.</P>

She recommends that parents use aSmall Parts Cylinder ($2.48, Discovery Toys, 800-426-4777) to test the safetyof small parts on their children's toys.</P><P>    Children spend most of their time with toys, from day one through their growing-up years.  Nemeth believes that an informed, good toy purchase is an  investment in a child.  Although some safety issues are based on good common  sense, there are other helpful guidelines that can assist parents in choosing  safe toys.</P><P>    Nemeth suggests parents do a toy safety check-up using the five S's of toy  safety:</P><ul>   <li>Size -- small parts such as buttons, eyes, wheels, staples or bells caneasily come off or be swallowed.  The Small Parts Cylinder is a handymeasuring device.  If a piece fits in the container, the piece is too smallfor children under three years.</p>    <li>Shape -- buy toys with smooth surfaces.  Avoid sharp edges and bluntends as well as brittle, plastic or glass products or metal pieces that canbend and cut.</p>    <li>Surfaces -- labels on toys should tell you if they are non-toxic andfire resistant.  Avoid beads made from seeds or painted with toxic paint andany toys containing liquids that could leak.</p>    <li>Strings -- these are suitable for older children but can become wrappedaround wrists or necks.</p>    <li>Supervision -- provide a safe place to play and be aware of potentialdangers in toys.</p></ul><P>    "Play is a child's work," says Nemeth, "and it's vitally important to  provide them with safe, fun tools for their development.  This includes  choosing toys that are right for your child's age."  It's important to follow  the manufacturer's age recommendations and keep toys designed for older  children out of the reach of younger children.</P><P>    Small Parts Cylinder, $2.48, Discovery Toys, call 800-426-4777.</P><P>    CONTACT:  Vickie Silver of Discovery Toys, 510-371-3755</P><a href="#top">Back to top</a></td></tr></table> <hr><center><h4> <a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |  <a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |    <a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> | <a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |    <A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |  <a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center> <img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left>   <address>We love to talk with you.

That's right, toys.  With all the crammingof little minds that goes on at school and even many preschools, your childrenneed plenty of time to play, breathe and just use those fresh imaginations.Some toys are much better at encouraging this type of play than others.Parent alert:  toys that are loads of fun can still be part of the totallearning experience.  You really can accomplish both learning and play if youfollow some simple suggestions and don't get too heavy-handed in pushing forskills.</p> <p>    ASTRA(SM), the American Specialty Toy Retailing Association, has compileda list of the top toys for stimulating the imagination and there's not a flashcard in the bunch.  (It's not that ASTRA has anything against flash cards.)It's just that ASTRA's more than 500 members have more imaginative ways tostimulate your child's young mind.  Whether you have a budding builder of twoor a master artist of twelve, there is a toy that's just right to spark newideas and to foster that lovely gift called curiosity.</p> <p>    In developing a top ten list of toys to stimulate children'simaginations, ASTRA members drew from experts and even from bright minds inhistory:  Einstein was fascinated by a pocket compass at age five.  FrankLloyd Wright grew up playing with blocks.  Even Benjamin Franklin got thatkite idea from somewhere!  ASTRA's toy  panel also drew from developmentalexperts who learned, as an example, that strong contrasting patterns andvaried textures are more stimulating for babies than flat objects and mutedpastels.  But mostly, ASTRA members drew from their countless hours and yearsof experience with the real experts:  kids.  Toys stocked or made by ASTRAmembers are child tested for safety, quality and play value and then handselected by specialty retailers who are dedicated to providing products thatare creative and have lasting value.</p> <p>    Some of the toys that stimulate complex brain waves are the simplest.Basic wooden blocks and other building sets come up again and again as idealtoys.  Children who use them can build anything from simple toy towers toelaborate kingdoms, outer space worlds, underwater cities and more.  For olderchildren, Interstar Master Builder Set by International Playthings or theGiant Set by K'Nex are recommended.  If you have a future architect or justwant your younger child to picture more than her own room's walls, chooseblocks.  Sets are available for all ages at specialty retailers from brightwooden ones for toddlers to highly intricate sets that will challenge mostparents.</p> <p>    Costumes and dress-up accessories provide year-round fun and practicallyinsist upon great imagination.  Your child can be a medieval princess lockedin the tallest castle, a brave cowgirl or a rodeo rider on the range, allwithin the space of five minutes.  With a few simple items, your child candirect a whole cast of family and friends or retreat to a world of his own.Puppets such as Folkman Puppets are whimsical and another wonderful way toencourage make-believe while building storytelling confidence.</p>  <p>   You can't believe they don't know California is on the ocean?  USA MapPuzzles by Small World Toys help your child's sense of geography whiledeveloping pattern discernment skills.  My World Quilt by Curiosity Kitsencourages children to think beyond their own neighborhood in a fresh, simpleway.  Totem Carving by Creativity for Kids is a great craft-oriented toy thatenhances learning about American Indians.</p> <p>    There are too many great paints, pastel crayons, finger paints and artkits for ASTRA to name in its top ten list but they urge you to remember thevalue of art for both self-expression and encouraging imaginative flights offancy set to one-of-a-kind illustrations.  While beautiful and creative artsupplies and crafts abound, don't forget the importance of one quality pad ofartist's heavy paper to tell your children that all their drawings are keepersin your book.</p> <p>    For grade school children, Buried Treasure, Egyptian Dig by EducationalInsights is a wonderful way to enhance that familiar class unit on ancientruins.  Be daring and unlock the mysteries even before they get to thatchapter in school.  Toys and games like Survival or Extinction by Latz ChanceGames or Chronology by Great American Puzzle help children use their minds toweave a path through history and see into the future.</p>  <p>   If these toys sound too tame for your future scientist, try the AlienSlime Lab by Educational Insights.  There's a hidden bonus in this last toyselection:  slime is very "cool" this year.  Imagine that -- your choice oftoys can not only be smart, but also hip. </p><center>   <H3> Top Ten Toys To Tap Into Young Imaginations*</H3>      <table border=2>   <Tr>  <td> Alien Slime Lab   </td><td>            by Educational Insights </td></tr>   <Tr>  <td>    My World Quilt     </td><td>       by Curiosity Kits </td></tr>     <Tr>  <td>  Survival or Extinction    </td><td>     by Latz Chance Games </td></tr>    <Tr>  <td>   Lance Burton Magic Hat   </td><td>    by Harmony Toy </td></tr>     <Tr>  <td>  Costumes     </td><td>          by multiple manufacturers </td></tr>    <Tr>  <td>   Buried Treasure, Egyptian Dig  </td><td>  by Educational Insights </td></tr>   <Tr>  <td>    Wooden Blocks     </td><td>        by Brio </td></tr>    <Tr>  <td>   USA Map Puzzles     </td><td>      by Small World Toys </td></tr>    <Tr>  <td>   Interstar Master Builder Set  </td><td>   by International Playthings </td></tr>     <Tr>  <td>  Noah's Ark, Castle   </td><td>      by T.C.

This percentage has greatlyaffected the number of children whoare cared for outside the home bysomeone other than a parent and theway in which caregivers and parentsmust interact. Research on parentinvolvement suggests that parents shouldtake active roles in theirchildren's lives while the children are enrolledin child carefacilities and that parent involvement enhanceschildren'sdevelopment.</P><P>In the past, it was easier for parents(usually mothers) to volunteerfor activities in preschools or attendmeetings. But with many morewomen in the work force and headingsingle-parent families, it isbecoming difficult for many parents toparticipate actively in childcare programs. As a result, some parents maysee parent involvement inchild care programs as an additional pressure. Tobuild positiverelationships with parents, caregivers need to gain abetterunderstanding of the needs, concerns, and feelings ofemployedparents.</P><HR> <aname="Understanding"></a><H3>Understanding Parents </H3><P>Employedparents have different needs than parents who are notworking. Severalfactors--including competition, guilt, and time--mayaffect therelationship between an employed parent and a caregiver.The parents mayfeel they are competing with the caregiver for thechild's affection, sinceboth parent and caregiver have formedprotective attachments to the child.For example, the mother of one10-month-old was concerned that the childmight take her first stepsin the presence of the child care worker insteadof the mother.Likewise, a father became concerned at the end of the daywhen heasked his child to get ready to go home, and the child protestedbysaying, "I don't want to go home." In reality, the child wasjustshowing frustration at being separated from dad all day.Situationslike these can strain the relationships between parents andchild careworkers.</P><P>Guilt is another feeling that employed parentsexperience. They mayfeel that they are abandoning their children byleaving them whilethey work. Children often contribute to their parents'guilty feelingsby expressing their dislike of the parents' leaving.Childrensometimes show anger by crying and yelling at their parents whenit istime to separate. Children may say, "I don't want you to go towork,""Why do you have to go to work?" or "I don't like my school." Itisoften hard for parents to explain to their preschool children whytheyare working and why they must leave them. On the other hand,parentssometimes feel even more guilty when their children do notprotest.</P><P>Time is also a critical factor. Employed parents may feelthat theyhave many roles and duties to perform but not enough time toperformthem. Consequently, they often feel overwhelmed. Employedparentsplace their children in child care facilities because they arenotavailable to care for the children themselves. Parents who work 40ormore hours a week may feel that they do not have time to volunteerinthe center or come in to observe for an hour. The lack of timemayintensify the parents' feelings of guilt and competition.</P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR> <aname="Involving"></a><H3>Involving Employed Parents </H3><P>The childcare center and family day home must use a variety ofmethods to encourageparents to participate. Employed parents needmany options to choose fromif they are to become active participantsin the child caresetting.</P><P>Remember, not all parents will take advantage of everyopportunity.However, child care programs must continue to support familiesand theties between parents and children by allowing the parents tomakedecisions about how much involvement and which experiencesandactivities meet their needs. A child care service can supporttherelationship between parent and child through flexiblescheduling,parent visits, parent education, formal and informalcommunication,and informal gatherings.</P><P><B>FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING.</B>Many child care centers and preschools have aspecific time when allchildren must be present. Parents need theflexibility to bring childrenwhen they choose. Field trips and lunchare exceptions to this principle.However, if a parent can inform thestaff of the child's arrival time,plans can be adjusted accordingly.</P><P>Flexibility may allow a parentto spend a morning with the child ifthe parent doesn't have to be at workuntil noon on a certain day. Forexample, Jessica's dad doesn't have to beat work until 10:30 a.m. onWednesdays because he works late on Tuesdays.So Jessica and her daddo something special, such as jogging in the park.Flexibility alsomakes it easier if parents are divorced and the childstays overnightwith the noncustodial parent. Sometimes an extra hour inthe morninggives the parent an opportunity to spend additional time withthechild. The extra time with a parent may be more important thanthefingerpaint activity planned by the caregiver.</P><P>This type offlexibility does not mean that parents can have a drop-inarrangement everyday. Routines are important to a child's sense ofsecurity and well-being.It also does not mean that parents are givenreduced rates. Instead,parents and caregivers can work together todecide how to give parents theflexibility they may need.</P><P><B>PARENT VISITS.</B> Parents shouldhave open access to a facility, andvisit whenever they wish. One option isto invite parents as specialguests who demonstrate their talents. Parentscan also be encouragedto visit as a way of spending time with theirchildren. Parents cancome by at noon and take their children out to lunch.In infant andtoddler programs, parents often come to the child carefacility tofeed their babies during the lunch hour. For olderpreschoolers, lunchcan be a special treat, as long as they understand thatthey won'tleave when their parents leave. Sometimes parents may have otherhoursin the day that they would like to spend with their children. Afatherwho finishes a business errand sooner than expected may want to sitinthe room and read a story to his child or help the child completeapuzzle.</P><P><B>PARENT EDUCATION.</B> Child care centers and familyday homes can offerparents information on topics such as family timemanagement, childdevelopment, nutrition, safety, and parent-childcommunication.Employed parents may not want to come back to a nightmeeting afterthey pick up their children in the evening. Facilities canplanprograms for various times. Brown bag lunches may be best forsomeparents, while after-work potlucks or dinner meetings with childcareproviders may be better for others. Some may prefer earlybreakfastmeetings. Whatever arrangements are made, child care facilitiescancontinue to make information available through newsletters,parentbulletin boards, and communication at arrival and departuretimes.</P><P><B>INFORMAL COMMUNICATION.</B> Daily communication betweenparents andcaregivers is essential. Caregivers need to talk with parentsas theyarrive and depart. Information about a child's time away fromthecenter and behavior in the center can be exchanged. Insharinginformation, the caregiver and parent can begin to developanunderstanding of each other's goals for the child.</P><P>One excellentmethod, especially with infants and toddlers, is forcaregivers to sendhome a daily information sheet so that parents havesome information aboutwhat the child did during the day. Parents areinterested in what theirchildren are like when they are not withthem. On a half sheet of paper,write the child's name, eatingpattern, toileting behavior, playmates, andcomments about activitiesin which the child has participated. The dailyinformation sheetsshould not replace personal contact with parents at theend of theday. Caregivers should make sure they have at least onepositivestatement about each child that they can share with the parent attheend of the day.</P><P><B>FORMAL COMMUNICATION.</B> Home visits areanother important, but rarelyused, communication tool. Caregivers shouldtry to visit children'shomes at least once a year. A parent is often ableto talk more easilywhen the caregiver is on the parent's turf. Caregiverscan learn aboutthe parent's child rearing practices. Parent-teacherconferences arestill a must in centers and homes. These conferencesprovide anopportunity for parents and caregivers to interact. Since aconferenceprovides a sharing of information, the caregiver must beprepared toreceive and to give information.</P><P><B>INFORMALGATHERINGS.</B> Planning opportunities for parents, staff, andchildren tointeract informally is also important. Examples include aSaturday carnivalin the spring or fall, an afternoon at the pool, apotluck supper, or anafternoon at the skating rink. As parents becomeacquainted, they can turnto each other for support.</P><P>Understanding and responding to theneeds of working parents isnecessary to maintaining healthy communicationbetween parents andcaregivers. A positive relationship between parents andthe child carestaff will bring rich rewards in the child'sdevelopment.</P><P>The article was adapted from "Working with WorkingFamilies," TEXASCHILD CARE QUARTERLY (Fall 1989): 3-8.</P><HR> <aname="More"></a><H3>For More Information </H3><P>Berger, E.

<H3>What Are The Social-Emotional Needs Of Gifted Children? </H3>


<P>To a large degree, the needs of gifted children are the same as those
of other
children.  The same developmental stages occur, though often at a younger age
(Webb &amp; Kleine, 1993).  Gifted children may face the same potentially
limiting
problems, such as family poverty, substance abuse, or alcoholism.  Some needs
and problems, however, appear more often among gifted children.</P>

<HR>

<a name="Types"></a>
<H3>Types Of Problems </H3>



<P>It is helpful to conceptualize needs of gifted children
in terms of those that  arise because of the interaction
with the environmental setting (e.g., family,  school,
or cultural milieu) and those that arise internally
because of the very  characteristics of the gifted child.
</P>
<P>Several intellectual and personality attributes
characterize gifted children  and should be noted at the
outset.  These characteristics may be strengths, but

<BR>

<P>These characteristics are seldom inherently problematic by themselves.
More
often, combinations of these characteristics lead to behavior patterns
such as:</P>

<P><B>Uneven Development.</B>  Motor skills, especially
fine-motor, often lag behind  cognitive conceptual
abilities, particularly in preschool gifted children
(Webb  &amp; Kleine, 1993).  These children may see in their
"mind's eye" what they want  to do, construct, or draw;
however, motor skills do not allow them to achieve the
goal.  Intense frustration and emotional outbursts may
result. </P>

<P><B>Peer Relations. </B> As preschoolers and in primary grades,
gifted children  (particularly highly gifted) attempt
to organize people and things.  Their  search for
consistency emphasizes "rules," which they attempt to
apply to  others.  They invent complex games and try to
organize their playmates, often  prompting resentment
in their peers. </P>

<P><B>Excessive Self-Criticism.</B>  The ability to see
possibilities and alternatives  may imply that
youngsters see idealistic images of what they might be,
and  simultaneously berate themselves because they see
how they are falling short of  an ideal
(Adderholt-Elliott, 1989; Powell &amp; Haden, 1984;
Whitmore, 1980).   </P>

<P><B>Perfectionism.</B>  The ability to see how one might ideally
perform, combined with  emotional intensity, leads many
gifted children to unrealistically high  expectations
of themselves.  In high ability children, perhaps 15-20%
may be  hindered significantly by perfectionism at some
point in their academic  careers, and even later in life.  </P>

<P><B>Avoidance of Risk-Taking.</B> In the same way the gifted
youngsters see the  possibilities, they also see
potential problems in undertaking those  activities.
Avoidance of potential problems can mean avoidance of
risk-taking, and may result in underachievement
(Whitmore, 1980).
</P>
<P><B>Multipotentiality.</B>  Gifted children often have several
advanced capabilities  and may be involved in diverse
activities to an almost frantic degree.  Though  seldom a
problem for the child, this may create problems for the
family, as  well as quandaries when decisions must be
about career selection (Kerr, 1985; 1991).  </P>

<P><B>Gifted Children with Disabilities.</B>  Physical
disabilities can prompt social and  emotional
difficulties.  Intellect may be high, but motor
difficulties such as  cerebral palsy may prevent
expression of potential.  Visual or hearing  impairment
or a learning disability may cause frustration.  Gifted
children  with disabilities tend to evaluate themselves
more on what they are unable to do than on their
substantial abilities (Whitmore &amp; Maker, 1985).   </P>

<HR>

<a name="Outside"></a>
<H3>Problems From Outside Sources  </H3>



<P><B>Lack of understanding or support</B> for gifted children,
and sometimes actual  ambivalence or hostility, creates
significant problems (Webb &amp; Kleine, 1993).   Some common
problem patterns are:</P>

<P><B>School Culture and Norms.</B>  Gifted children, by
definition, are "unusual" when  compared with same-age
children--at least in cognitive abilities--and
require  different educational experiences (Kleine &amp;
Webb, 1992).  Schools, however,  generally group
children by age.  The child often has a dilemma--conform
to the  expectations for the average child or be seen as
nonconformist.   </P>

<P><B>Expectations by Others. </B> Gifted
children--particularly the more creative--do  not
conform.  Nonconformists violate or challenge
traditions, rituals, roles, or expectations.  Such
behaviors often prompt discomfort in others.  The gifted
child, sensitive to others' discomfort, may then try to
hide abilities.</P>

<P><B>Peer Relations.</B>  Who is a peer for a gifted child?  Gifted
children need  several peer groups because their
interests are so varied.  Their advanced levels of
ability may steer them toward older children.  They may
choose peers by reading books (Halsted, 1994). Such
children are often thought of as "loners."  The conflict
between fitting in and being an individual may be quite
stressful.  </P>

<P><B>Depression.</B> Depression is usually being angry at
oneself or at a situation over  which one has little or no
control.  In some families, continual evaluation and
criticism of performance--one's own and others--is a
tradition.  Any natural  tendency to self-evaluate
likely will be inflated.  Depression and academic
underachievement may be increased.
 Sometimes educational misplacement causes the gifted
youngster to feel  caught in a slow motion world.
Depression may result because the child feels  caught in
an unchangeable situation.  </P>

<P><B>Family Relations.</B>  Families particularly influence the
development of social  and emotional competence.  When
problems occur, it is not because parents  consciously
decide to create difficulties for gifted children.  It is
because  parents lack information about gifted
children, or lack support for appropriate  parenting, or
are attempting to cope with their own unresolved
problems (which  may stem from their experiences with
being gifted). </P>

<HR>

<a name="Preventing"></a>
<H3>Preventing Problems  </H3>



<P><B>Reach out to Parents.</B>  Parents are particularly
important in preventing social  or emotional problems.
Teaching, no matter how excellent or supportive, can
seldom counteract inappropriate parenting.
Supportive family environments, on  the other hand, can
counteract unhappy school experiences.  Parents need
information if they are to nurture well and to be wise
advocates for their  children.</P>

<P><B>Focus on Parents of Young Children.</B>  Problems are best
prevented by involving  parents when children are young.
Parents particularly must understand  characteristics
that may make gifted children seem different or
difficult.  </P>

<P><B>Educate and Involve Health-Care and Other
Professionals.</B> Concentrated efforts  should be made to
involve such professionals in state and local meetings
and in  continuing education programs concerning gifted
children.  Pediatricians,  psychologists, and other
caregivers such as day-care providers typically have
received little training about gifted children, and
therefore can provide  little assistance to parents
(Webb &amp; Kleine, 1993).   </P>

<P><B>Use Educational Flexibility.</B>  Gifted children require
different and more  flexible educational experiences.
When the children come from multicultural or  low-income
families, educational flexibility and reaching out may
be  particularly necessary.  Seven flexibly paced
educational options, relatively  easy to implement in
most school settings (Cox, Daniel &amp; Boston, 1985) are:
early entrance; grade skipping; advanced level
courses; compacted courses;  continuous progress in the
regular classroom; concurrent enrollment in advanced
classes; and credit by examination.  These options are
based on competence and  demonstrated ability, rather
than on arbitrary age groupings.
 </P>
<P><B>Establish Parent Discussion Groups.</B>  Parents of gifted
children typically have  few opportunities to talk with
other parents of gifted children. Discussion  groups
provide opportunities to "swap parenting recipes" and
child-rearing  experiences.  Such experiences provide
perspective as well as specific  information  (Webb &amp;
DeVries, 1993).

<a name="math"></a>

<P>This is the third article in a series about strategies to help the child who is having difficulty in school. It is taken from a workshop presented at our recent Conference.</P>

<P><I>FAUS past president, Pat Palmer, discussed ways teachers and parents can help the child who is having problems in school. Even after a youngster is successfully on the Feingold Program, deficits may remain.</I></P>

<P>In the area of math, make sure the child understands math symbols as well as the numbers. If a child doesn't understand the symbols used in math, he won't be able to do the work. For example, what do you have to know to add 2 plus 3 minus 1? "Plus." Does he understand that plus means to add more? Now you've added 2 more; you have 4. That's a new number. Minus 1. Does he know that minus means take away? Then you have an equal sign. All of what I've just done equals what? This isn't a simple problem, but a sequence of numbers and symbols and concepts that the child has to understand, and if he doesn't understand each of these things he won't be able to do the math.</P>

<P>Try to identify the "weak link" in the chain of math skills. As math advances, he will have to carry out more complex sequences. In long division you need to divide, multiply and subtract, as well as carry numbers. Any one portion that is not understood will prevent him from being able to gain the skill, so try to find the place where he is having trouble and work on that weak link. (In his workshops on helping children with learning disabilities, Dr. John Taylor has a cute saying that helps children remember the steps they need to use for long division. The first initials for "divide, multiply, subtract and check" become: "Does Mother Serve Cheeseburgers?"</P>

<P>Some children who have difficulty doing math problems understand all the symbols and have the needed skills, but they can't keep the columns of numbers neatly lined up, so they add and subtract the wrong numbers. Graph paper may be helpful, but it can be hard on the teacher who has to check the work. There's a much easier solution that I like to share with the teachers in my course.</P>

<P>Take a sheet of lined paper and turn it on its side, so the lines are vertical instead of horizontal. Write an addition problem so that each number is in its own space. The lines will keep the columns of numbers in a row, and they can then be added up. This is easier for a teacher to read, and doesn't require special paper. What difference does it make if the paper is held sideways? The important thing is for the child to learn the math.</P>

<P>Underline the actions in a math problem; ignore the words, and you can then turn it into a math problem.</P>

<P>Movement games are a good way to teach numbers. For example, `'Every second child move left."</P>

<a name="getting"></a>

<H3>Getting It Together ... And Keeping It That Way</H3>

<P>Since these children have so much trouble trying to get things organized, they may need not only to have a planner, but should have a specific time when they work on it, perhaps right after dinner, or after homework has been completed.</P>

<P>Have the child collect the things he needs to take to school the next day, and put them in the same place every evening. Judy Schneider had a system that worked well for her son. She used a variety of expandable, colored file folders which are enclosed on the sides. Each subject had a different color folder. There was room in each one for his book, assignment paper, homework, pen or pencil, etc. Everything he needed in school was right there; he had only to select the right folder. This is especially helpful when a child moves to a different classroom to change subjects.</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="reluctant"></a>
<H3>When A Child Is Reluctant To Ask For Help, Problems Multiply</H3>

<P>Both teachers and parents can learn a lot about how to help a child if they find out how he or she feels about making mistakes. We adults know that mistakes are a part of learning, and a part of life itself; but don't assume that your child sees them that way.</P>

<P>One Feingolder encountered many problems in junior high and high school because she had the idea that she was somehow expected to know the work being taught - even before her teachers got to it! After some heart-to-heart discussion, it came out that a teacher in elementary school had made her feel dumb because she didn't know the answer to an obscure question. (The teacher might not have intended this; keep in mind that our kids sometimes misinterpret other's words.)</P>

<P>She was relieved when she was assured that teachers would be out of a job if their students knew all the answers. To overcome her shyness about asking questions in class, she was encouraged to write a note and leave it on the teacher's desk, asking for some personal help.</P>

<P>She also had to overcome a perfectionistic tendency. Rather than turn in a homework paper with some answers missing, she would not turn in anything at all - getting zeros rather than a B+ .</P>

<H3>What Is Meant By "Communication Disorders"?  </H3>



<P>The term COMMUNICATION DISORDERS encompasses a wide variety of
problems in language, speech, and hearing. Speech and language
impairments include articulation problems, voice disorders, fluency
problems (such as stuttering), aphasia (difficulty in using words,
usually as a result of a brain injury), and delays in speech and/or
language. Speech and language delays may be due to many factors,
including environmental factors or hearing loss.</P>

<P>Hearing impairments include partial hearing and deafness. Deafness may
be defined as a loss sufficient to make auditory communication
difficult or impossible without amplification. There are four types of
hearing loss. Conductive hearing losses are caused by diseases or
obstructions in the outer or middle ear and can usually be helped with
a hearing aid. Sensorineural losses result from damage to the sensory
hair cells of the inner ear or the nerves that supply it and may not
respond to the use of a hearing aid. Mixed hearing losses are those in
which the problem occurs both in the outer or middle ear and in the
inner ear. A central hearing loss results from damage to the nerves or
brain.</P>

<P>Many communication disorders result from other conditions such as
learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, or cleft
lip or cleft palate.</P>

<HR>

<a name="Many"></a>
<H3>How Many Children Have Communication Disorders? </H3>



<P>The overall estimate for speech and language disorders is widely
agreed to be 5% of school-aged children. This figure includes voice
disorders (3%) and stuttering (1%). The incidence of elementary school
children who exhibit delayed phonological (articulation) development
is 2% to 3%, although the percentage decreases steadily with age.</P>

<P>Estimates of hearing impairments vary considerably, with one widely
accepted figure of 5% representing the portion of school-aged children
with hearing levels outside the normal range. Of this number, 10% to
20% require some type of special education. Approximately one-third of
students who are deaf attend residential schools. Two-thirds attend
day programs in schools for students who are deaf or day classes
located in regular schools. The remainder are mainstreamed into
regular school programs.</P>
<HR>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
<H3>What Are Some Characteristics Of Children With Communication
Disorders?  </H3>



<P>A child with speech or language delays may present a variety of
characteristics including the inability to follow directions, slow and
incomprehensible speech, and pronounced difficulties in syntax and
articulation. SYNTAX refers to the order of words in a sentence, and
ARTICULATION refers to the manner in which sounds are formed.
Articulation disorders are characterized by the substitution of one
sound for another or the omission or distortion of certain sounds.</P>

<P>Stuttering or dysfluency is a disorder of speech flow that most often
appears between the ages of 3 and 4 years and may progress from a
sporadic to a chronic problem. Stuttering may spontaneously disappear
by early adolescence, but speech and language therapy should be
considered.</P>

<P>Typical voice disorders include hoarseness, breathiness, or sudden
breaks in loudness or pitch. Voice disorders are frequently combined
with other speech problems to form a complex communication disorder.</P>

<P>A child with a possible hearing problem may appear to strain to hear,
ask to have questions repeated before giving the right answer,
demonstrate speech inaccuracies (especially dropping the beginnings
and endings of words), or exhibit confusion during discussion.
Detection and diagnosis of hearing impairment have become very
sophisticated. It is possible to detect the presence of hearing loss
and evaluate its severity in a newborn child.</P>

<P>Students who speak dialects different from standard English may have
communication problems that represent either language differences or,
in more severe instances, language disorders.</P>

<HR>

<a name="Educational"></a>
<H3>What Are The Educational Implications Of Communication Disorders? </H3>



<P>Many speech problems are developmental rather than physiological, and
as such they respond to remedial instruction. Language experiences are
central to a young child's development. In the past, children with
communication disorders were routinely removed from the regular class
for individual speech and language therapy. This is still the case in
severe instances, but the trend is toward keeping the child in the
mainstream as much as possible. In order to accomplish this goal,
teamwork among the teacher, speech and language therapist,
audiologist, and parents is essential. Speech improvement and
correction are blended into the regular classroom curriculum and the
child's natural environment.</P>

<P>Amplification may be extremely valuable for the child with a hearing
impairment. Students whose hearing is not completely restored by
hearing aids or other means of amplification have unique communication
needs. Children who are deaf are not automatically exposed to the
enormous amounts of language stimulation experienced by hearing
children in their early years. For deaf children, early, consistent,
and conscious use of visible communication modes such as sign
language, finger spelling, and cued speech and/or amplification and
aural/oral training can help reduce this language delay. Some
educators advocate a strict oral approach in which the child is
required to use as much speech as possible, while others favor the use
of sign language and finger spelling combined with speech, an approach
known as TOTAL COMMUNICATION. There is increasing consensus that
whatever system works best for the individual should be used.</P>

<P>Many children with hearing impairments can be served in the regular
classroom with support services. In addition to amplification,
instructional aids such as captioned films and high interest/low
vocabulary reading materials are helpful. For most children with
hearing impairments, language acquisition and development are
significantly delayed, sometimes leading to an erroneously low
estimate of intelligence.</P>

<P>Students whose physical problems are so severe that they interfere
with or completely inhibit communication can frequently take advantage
of technological advances that allow the individual to make his or her
needs and wants known, perhaps for the first time.</P>

<P>    WASHINGTON, Nov. 7, 1996 -- In two separate incidents, a toddler
nearly died after coming in contact with a very small amount of a widely
available car wheel cleaner, according to a report in the December issue of
the Annals of Emergency Medicine.</P>

<P>    Each child was rushed to the emergency department after becoming drowsy
and vomiting, but other signs of chemical poisoning were not initially
apparent.  Both children appeared to get better, then experienced cardiac
arrest.  When the parents remembered that their child had been playing near a
bottle of ARMOR ALL(TM) Quicksilver wheel cleaner, emergency physicians were
quickly able to diagnose and treat for poisoning.</P>

<P>    One child, who was believed to have been sprayed with the cleaner, has
some long-term motor and speech delays.  The other child recovered completely.</P>

<P>    Authors found that the combination of ingredients in the cleaner may have
delayed serious symptoms and caused an initial underestimation of the severity
of exposure.  "These are the first two cases we have seen from a hydrofluoride
acid-like substance, mainly ammonium bifluoride, but the general public
frequently uses similar cleaners for automobile care," says Anthony Scalzo,
MD, senior author and an emergency physician.  When tested, traces of a toxic
ingredient in the wheel cleaner were found in both children.</P>

<P>    "The number of reported cases is small but parents need to be aware of the
extreme toxicity of these cleaning products," says Ann Klasner, MD, first
author and senior emergency medicine fellow.  Less than one teaspoon of the
ammonium bifluoride mix can prove dangerous to children.  To prevent these
kinds of problems, emergency physicians recommend:</P>

<ul>


  <li> Use extreme caution when using or storing any cleaning products
containing hydrofluoric acid and ammonium bifluoride.  If ingredients aren't
listed, READ LABEL CAREFULLY FOR WARNINGS.</p>
   <li> Never leave household cleaning products where children, especially
toddlers, can reach them and keep these products in locked cabinets when they
are not being used.</p>
    <li>Never put a household product in a different container.</p>
    <li>Try to buy products with child-resistant packaging and urge
manufacturers to package potentially toxic household products in
child-resistant packaging.  Remember that even products with child-resistant
packaging must be kept safely away from young children.

</ul>

<P>    The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is investigating
potential hazards with products containing ammonium bifluoride.  CPSC has
received several reports of adverse health effects associated with products
containing ammonium bifluoride.</P>
<P>    The Quicksilver label claims the product will "safely and effortlessly
clean your wheels," and does not have child-resistant packaging, although it
does warn to keep out of the reach of children.</P>

<P>    WASHINGTON, Nov. 1, 1996 -- The American Automobile Manufacturers
Association (AAMA) and its members -- Chrysler, Ford and General Motors --
along with the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of Canada (MVMA-C),
today announced the implementation of major initiatives designed to further
improve air bag safety for vehicle occupants.  Air bags and safety belts save
lives, but for children, air bags can be deadly.</P>

<P>    "The air bag is a highly effective safety device intended to save people,"
said Andrew H. Card, Jr., AAMA President and Chief Executive Officer.
"Chrysler, Ford and General Motors will continue to pursue all avenues to
protect motorists through improved vehicle safety. America's Car Companies
want to strengthen and build upon air bags' lifesaving record and believe they
have developed the tools to do it."</P>

    <H3>Depowering Air Bags</H3>
    
<P>    Chrysler, Ford and General Motors are volunteering to depower driver and
passenger side air bags in Canada -- where there are no regulatory constraints
to doing so -- and are urging the U.S. to take immediate action to permit
depowering as well.  In August of this year, AAMA petitioned the U.S.
government to allow for improved, slower deploying -- "depowered" -- air bags
in this country.  America's Car Companies believe that slowing the speed and
thereby reducing the force with which air bags deploy would further reduce the
risks posed by air bags.  Depowering offers the best near-term solution to
mitigate air bag risks for all vehicle occupants. Chrysler, Ford and General
Motors are working with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) on the depowering issue.</P>

   <H3> New Labels</H3>
<P>    Chrysler, Ford and General Motors will voluntarily include additional air
bag warning labels in all new vehicles.  These labels will alert drivers and
passengers to the risks associated with air bags as well as emphasize proper
use.  The companies will work with NHTSA to define label content and determine
placement in the vehicle consistent with government recommendations.</P>

   <H3> Letters to Owners and Customer Information</H3>
   
<P>    Chrysler, Ford and General Motors are sending letters to current owners of
vehicles equipped with passenger side air bags to remind them of the risks
inherent with air bags and to advise them how to optimize air bag
effectiveness.  An air bag is intended to provide maximum protection when used
with a safety belt.  It is not a substitute for a safety belt. Everyone who
drives and transports children should know this lifesaving information as
recommended by NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB):</P>

<ul>

   <li> It's safer for children 12 and under to ride buckled up in a rear seat;
   <ul>
    <li>Infants in rear-facing child safety seats should NEVER ride in the
        front seat of a vehicle with a passenger side air bag;
     <li>Small children should be secured in a rear seat in child safety
        seats approved for their age and size;
    <li> Older children should ride properly buckled up, and they too are
        safer in a rear seat;
     <li> Never allow children to slide the shoulder belt behind them;
</ul> </p>

   <li> Every occupant should be properly belted, whenever possible, with both
       lap AND shoulder belts; </p>

   <li>Driver and front passenger seats should be moved back as far as
       practical; and </p>

   <li> Check your vehicle owner's manual and the instructions provided with
       your child safety seat for correct use information.
       </ul>

<P>    In addition, AAMA and its members will continue to support and encourage
comprehensive air bag education through the Air Bag Safety Campaign.  The
Campaign is a partnership of automotive manufacturers, insurance companies,
occupant restraint manufacturers, health care professionals and child health
and safety organizations.  The Campaign is working with government agencies to
increase the proper use of safety belts and child safety seats and to inform
the public about how to maximize the lifesaving capabilities of air bags and
minimize the risks.</P>

   <H3> Technology</H3>
<P>    In the longer-term, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors are committed to the
development of technologically feasible "smart" air bags and improving vehicle
safety technology. They will continue to dedicate major resources to research
and development to improve and enhance overall protection for all vehicle
occupants.</P>

    <H3>Driver Responsibility</H3>
<P>    When air bags were first introduced, only 10 to 20 percent of motorists
buckled their safety belts.  Times have changed, and today in the U.S., nearly
70 percent buckle up.  While this increase is good as far as it goes,
Americans must become more diligent about protecting themselves in vehicles.
Drivers must be responsible for buckling their own safety belts and making
sure that everyone in the car is properly belted and that children are
properly secured in a rear seat.</P>
<P>    "For Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, nothing is more important than
consumer safety," added Card.  "Improving air bag and overall vehicle safety
have been and will continue to be top priorities for America's Car Companies."</P>
<P>    Every time you drive, remember ... Buckle up, Children in back.</P>
