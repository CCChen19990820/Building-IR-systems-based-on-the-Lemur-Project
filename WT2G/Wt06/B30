<H2><IMG SRC="image/blsq.gif"> <A NAME="RTFToC1">Defense Relevance</A></H2>

As Defense reduces its procurement budget and demands lower prices for the
systems it requires, Defense production must become more effective. Although
the DoD signs contracts with large prime contractors, these contractors rely on
hundreds of small manufacturers. In the United States, there are more than
381,000 small manufacturing firms with under 500 employees each, making up more
than 98 percent of all manufacturing establishments. These firms contribute
more than half the value added in manufacturing. They tend to be product
oriented, working for both commercial original equipment manufacturers and
Defense prime contractors. These small manufacturers are the backbone of
Defense acquisition, and unless they can respond to the new realities imposed
on them by the prime contractors they support, the cost and availability of
Defense systems will be adversely affected.
<P>
Given the state of manufacturing in this country, it is clear that the
hoped-for response will not occur without assistance. Technology Deployment
projects are specifically designed to renew and upgrade the foundation of the
DoD manufacturing base by giving these small manufacturers access to new
technologies and enhancing their manufacturing capabilities to meet the
challenges imposed on them by the changing realities of Defense procurement.<P>
 The projects the TRP initiated to provide this support to manufacturing can be
divided into two categories. The first, manufacturing extension programs and
extension enabling services, establishes or expands manufacturing outreach
centers and extension services related to these centers. The second, technology
access and related programs, provides direct access to specific technologies of
interest to the DoD.
<P>
<H2><IMG SRC="image/blsq.gif"> <A NAME="RTFToC2">Manufacturing Extension Programs
and Extension Enabling
Services</A></H2>
The manufacturing extension programs are conceptually modeled after the early
agricultural extension centers that provided support to small farmers as they
began to cope with advances in agricultural methods and technology. Today, U.S.
manufacturing is in a similar period of transition. Small manufacturers
generally lack the resources and expertise necessary to adapt to advances in
manufacturing technologies. Yet these advances (computer-aided design, lean
manufacturing, etc.) are essential if the DoD is to have low-cost,
high-performance systems. The manufacturing centers funded by the TRP provide
this assistance through field agents, hardware and software demonstrations,
consultation services, and hands-on support as required. In addition, several
TRP projects are designed to support the centers themselves to increase their
capacity to serve small business. These DoD investments will help ensure that
Defense can continue to rely on a vibrant U.S. manufacturing base to meet its
future acquisition needs.

The pace of new technology development in the United States surpasses that in
any other country. This is to a great extent due to our extensive body of
university research and, perhaps more important, our superb assortment of
national and Defense laboratories.  Unfortunately, the United States is not
among the leaders in moving its technology into the marketplace. This is
clearly the case in the area of manufacturing. Since DoD systems rely on
advanced technology, it is essential that U.S. manufacturers have access to and
an understanding of the latest technology and that they are able to take
advantage of these advances. Otherwise, the existing technical capabilities are
inaccessible; for example, advances made by the DoD in composites are of no
benefit to Defense unless there is a manufacturing base that can produce the
advanced composites and the tooling required for their production.<P>
 Thus, the goal of these TRP projects is to give small businesses and services
access to the latest technology and capabilities so that these advances can be
implemented for the benefit of the DoD. Many of these projects are designed to
help move the technology toward full-scale manufacturing.

<H2><IMG SRC="image/blsq.gif"> <A NAME="RTFToC1">Defense Relevance</A></H2>

The Manufacturing Education and Training (MET) thrust of the TRP is based on
the DoD's interest in a technologically skilled workforce that can quickly
design and manufacture what the DoD needs. During World War II, America's
unequaled skills in mass production enabled it to arm an entire
alliance--serving as the "Arsenal of Democracy." In the wake of Sputnik (1957),
the DoD was a leader in improving scientific and technical education because it
recognized that the ability to counter new weapons demanded new knowledge.
Today, TRP's MET effort is strengthening the manufacturing skills needed in a
post-Cold War world of "lean production" and small Defense procurements. In
this atmosphere, the DoD will rely more on commercial manufacturing to meet its
needs, particularly during a crisis; strong commercial manufacturing skills
will be of paramount importance as the DoD draws on the marketplace to
reconstitute our forces.
<P>
America is no longer the unquestioned leader in manufacturing, partly because
our engineering education programs have not been product oriented. One group of
MET projects is working to reemphasize design and manufacturing in U.S.
engineering education. This effort will involve revising curricula to make them
more relevant to industrial practice. Another group of MET projects is
upgrading and retraining the technical workforce, particularly workers
displaced by Defense downsizing. This will preserve and improve worker skills
that are national assets. Though MET is the smallest of TRP's concentrations,
it will yield strong returns in the long term.

<H2><IMG SRC="image/blsq.gif"> <A NAME="RTFToC2">Projects to Reshape
Manufacturing Engineering
Education</A></H2>

These projects are working with U.S. engineering education to emphasize the
design and manufacturing skills needed by the DoD. Overall, the goal is to
increase the understanding, and the standing, of manufacturing among
engineering students. This will involve creating and revising courses, opening
new degree options in manufacturing, bringing manufacturing issues into
first-year engineering classes, having students solve real industrial design
and manufacturing problems, and improving laboratory equipment. Industry is
involved in all of these projects, ensuring that the curricula will be truly
relevant. Engineers savvy in manufacturing will be crucial as the DoD relies
more and more on the commercial industrial base to meet its needs.

papers, substantiating ARPA's optimism. But after congressional cuts of the
TRP's FY 1995 budget, the program had to be dramatically revised, requiring
ARPA to reduce the scope of the solicitation. Despite these revisions, the
strategy of the FY 1995 solicitation remains the same. With efforts expected to
be announced in October 1995, it still focuses on the development of dual-use
technologies that respond to some of the Categories of Military Need:<P>
<UL><LI>Casualty treatment<P>
<LI>Command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence<P>
<LI>Mechanical systems and materials<P>
<LI>Battlefield sensors<P>
<LI>Weapons, survivability, and other<P>
</UL>
Each technology area addresses a significant challenge within these categories.
These areas and their military benefits are listed on the following pages.<P>
<HR><H2>CASUALTY TREATMENT</H2><P>
<B>Biological Sensors and Multi-Organ Diagnosis</B><P>
New devices for sensing human physiologic parameters and diagnosing
organs will complement past TRP efforts in telemedicine and medical databases.
The U.S. Navy will cosponsor these programs, which will develop technologies
that can be broadly used for a wide spectrum of dual-use applications as shown
in the chart <I>Broad Uses for Future Casualty Treatment Projects</I>.<P>
<h3>BROAD USES FOR FUTURE CASUALTY TREATMENT PROJECTS</h3>
<center><table border=5 cellpadding=3 align=center>
<tr><th>Military<th>Civilian
<tr><td>Combat<td>Emergency Care
<tr><td>Casualty Care<td>Hospital and Hospice Care
<tr><td>Wound-Healing Monitoring<td>Home Care
</table></center><p>
The TRP's future focus on noninvasive sensor technology will provide important
medical data for remote wireless transmission. This technology must be
extremely sensitive and have very high resolutions to allow diagnostic-quality
interpretations. It also must consume minimal power and be able to resist
adverse effects of environmental conditions and body motion--all critical
requirements for the military.<P>
Diagnostic development will also focus on noninvasive, multi-organ screening
technologies that will greatly enhance the medic's ability to assess the
severity of combat wounds and to monitor wound healing. This TRP effort will
develop affordable technologies for sensing physiologic status on the
battlefield or in field hospitals.<P>
<HR><H2>COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, AND INTELLIGENCE
(C<SUP>4</SUP>I)</H2><P>
The Single Channel Ground and Air Radio System (SINCGARS) required
nearly 20 years to field. As a result, the system is badly out of date. The DoD
cannot allow this example to be the precedent for how the military proposes to
remain on the "cutting edge of technology." <P>
<B>Digital Wireless Communications and Networks</B><P>
 The FY 1995 solicitation emphasizes the ability of mobile stations to
communicate using wireless technologies. This area responds to a goal that the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council identified
as the first of the Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities most needed by the
U.S. Combatant Commands. This area will be conducted jointly with the Army. The
stated goal is "to maintain near-perfect real-time knowledge of the enemy, and
to communicate that to all forces in near-real time."<P>
Near-real-time communications among mobile stations requires very high
bandwidth communications networks. The DoD forecasts indicate that, by 2000,
capacities of tens to hundreds of terabytes (trillions of bytes) of data per
day will be needed to meet the increasing requirements in intelligence,
surveillance, communications, command, and control.<P>
Wireless technologies are needed to support such military thrusts as
"digitizing the battlefield." The products of these efforts will also feed into
two other TRP military needs categories: (1) weapons, survivability, and other,
and (2) casualty treatment. The military's needs for secure, digital,
high-data-rate systems that are networked and updatable are well documented;
however, it has become unfeasible for the Services to develop, produce, and
maintain special military communications equipment.<P>
The commercial development of wireless communications, on the other hand, has
made considerable progress. The remarkable gains in technology affordability in
the commercial wireless industries can solve the military's problems. Without
DoD presence, however, the commercial sector will not meet military
requirements--needs such as high bandwidth, robust networks during movement,
resistance to electromagnetic interference and jamming, rapid deployment (fixed
baseline infrastructure versus total mobility), and security. Certain advocates
in the commercial marketplace recommend solutions for each of these problems,
but that advocacy is too small to be addressed unless the DoD is committed to
share the cost of developing these technologies and to buy commercial
components and systems.<P>
The new set of TRP programs will accelerate the development of innovative
communications and networking products based on configurable, modular, digital
wireless technologies for military, law enforcement, and commercial
applications. At the same time, special military needs will be addressed.<P>
<HR><H2>MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND MATERIALS</H2>
With TRP-sponsored new technology, military aircraft can achieve an 18
percent thrust-to-weight ratio improvement, as well as a 9.7 percent total
onboard gross weight reduction. Commercial aircraft fuel costs can be reduced
by 4.6 percent, yielding a savings of up to $1 billion per year for the airline
industry.<P>
<B>Affordable Advanced Control Technologies</B><P>
Working with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force, participants will develop
and demonstrate advanced digital electronic and control technologies that are
also affordable. Dramatically enhancing U.S. product competitiveness, these
technologies may improve product capabilities as well as the efficiency and
cost-effectiveness of manufacturing.<P>
New technologies will improve reliability and high-temperature operation while
reducing cost, weight, volume, and power consumption. Computer intelligence and
precision positioning technologies are just two areas that can cut costs in
both Defense and commercial products. Fault-tolerant architectures, using
advances such as real-time electronic modules and new control algorithms to
exploit digital technology, will improve reliability and reduce the costs of
military and commercial electronic control systems.<P>
The military and the commercial sector will also realize benefits by using
effective dynamic, adaptive engine controls.<P>
Other U.S. industries, such as the automotive, health care, telecommunications,
and power generation and distribution industries, can also profit from these
advances. For example, the automotive industry can achieve a high degree of
function and integration of electronic control units for multiple components
and subsystems. In addition, manufacturers can incorporate technologies
demonstrated in this effort to improve processes and products--improvements
that could lead to lower product prices. Manufacturers that could benefit from
such technologies include producers of plastics-processing textile and
packaging machinery, steel rolling mills, and mining equipment.<P>
<B>Affordable Polymer Matrix Composites for Airframes</B><P>
Technological leadership in advanced materials and structures for
airframe components is essential for a competitive U.S. aerospace industry.
This goal is also vital to achieve leap-ahead performance in military
aircraft.<P>
Under this focus area, jointly conducted with the U.S. Air Force, participants
will develop and validate materials and manufacturing technologies to
affordably fabricate primary airframe composite structures such as wings for
transport aircraft. Areas to be considered include design for manufacturing,
assembly, and maintainability. Representative aircraft structural components
and subcomponents will be subjected to realistic usage environments to confirm
and validate the advantages in cost, performance, producibility, and
reliability from applying composite materials to airframes.<P>
<HR><H2>BATTLEFIELD SENSORS</H2><P>
<B>Small Precision Optics Manufacturing</B><P>
The TRP also plans to improve the cost-effectiveness of manufacturing
small precision optical components. Advances in optics-based products will
enhance national Defense by improving the performance and reducing the cost of
remote sensing and surveillance systems, flat-panel displays, and other
military systems. The goal is to improve military applications such as missile
seekers, night-vision goggles, and head-mounted display optics through
distortion-free and wide-field imaging (60-degree field of view for dismounted
infantry). Another goal is to cut unit costs in half.<P>
With these advances, the national economy should benefit through emerging
technologies that address critical national needs in the manufacturing,
information technology, health care, transportation, environmental, and
consumer and business sectors. Important commercial uses include
high-definition television, optical communications, microlithography, and
minimally invasive laser surgery.<P>
This focus area will allow the optics fabrication industry to work with
technology providers, system designers, and end users in specifying technical
requirements consistent with business goals for their markets. They will use
these requirements to formulate a strategy that accelerates the development and
deployment of new, low-cost precision optics manufacturing capabilities and
assembly techniques into commercial optics fabrication lines. In this way, the
DoD can exploit resulting products and manufacturing capability. The military
can benefit from early product insertion, reduced manufacturing costs, and
improved system performance.<P>
<HR><H2>WEAPONS, SURVIVABILITY, AND OTHER</H2>
<B>Operations Other Than War/Law Enforcement</B><P>
Our military has become involved in many missions collectively referred to as
operations other than war (OOTW) since the passing of the Soviet regime. Many
of  these operations, including peacekeeping and humanitarian aid, share more
requirements with law enforcement (LE) than with military actions. This program
area, conducted with the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps, will develop and
apply technologies that can directly and affordably address important military
and law-enforcement missions through a broad-based, dual-use effort. A common
industry technology base will improve the capabilities of both the soldier and
the law-enforcement officer. Typical technology objectives are offered below.
Affordability is key to all of them.<P>
<UL><LI>Individual protection. This area includes lightweight body armor
that protects body extremities without hindering mobility.<P>
<LI>Concealed weapons detection. Such capability must be able to
penetrate clothing, packaging, and walls and positively identify handguns and
knives.<P>
<LI>Multinational or multilingual systems support. Such support includes
language interpretation and translation to provide real-time two-way speech
translation.<P>
<LI>Communications, tracking, and monitoring devices. This area includes
systems that can covertly track objects and vehicles (including watercraft) in
local, regional, and global scenarios from fixed or mobile monitoring stations.
Micro-miniature geolocation navigation and status reporting for individuals are
also essential.<P>
<LI>Antimortar/antisniper systems. These systems can detect hostile fire
and direct return fire.<P>
<LI>Information processing and distribution. These systems can
specifically support OOTW/LE headquarters and field operations. This area may
include interoperability of voice and data systems and automated booking/case
files and record systems.<P>
<LI>Interactive simulation and modeling. OOTW/LE training, mission
planning, remote learning, and technology development planning can benefit in
this area.<P>
</UL>
<B>Microelectromechanical Technology Applications</B><P>
The TRP focus on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) will accelerate
the affordability, producibility, and insertion of these devices and systems
for military applications. Using demonstrated MEMS devices and concepts,
technology developments will address specific dual-use products or markets
enabled by cost and producibility of these devices.  Manufacturing technologies
that produce a class of related MEMS devices from a single, common fabrication
process are of particular interest. This fabrication process will include, but
is not limited to, a range of the following:<P>
<UL><LI>Embedded pressure sensors for automobile, truck, and aircraft
tires<P> <LI>Fluid valves, regulators, and meters for heating, ventilating, and
air-conditioning equipment; process control; printers; and analytical
instruments<P>
<LI>Inertial sensors to use in condition-based electromechanical
components and subsystems including gimbals for read/write heads on disk drives
and optomechanical couplers, aligners, and switches<P>
</UL>
The military can use this new and exciting technology in nearly all the
dual-use applications listed above, as well as more military-specific
applications such as special-mission scatterable devices. The small size and
potentially very low cost of these devices appeal to all Services.

<H1>Foreword</H1>


<HR>
<P>

Today, the Department of Defense not only has to ensure the capability of meeting
a diverse range of threats, it has to do it in an economically challenging environment.  
What has not changed is the value of this country's industrial base and technology 
capability to national security.
<P>
The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), as part of the Department of Defense, 
has been charged with the responsibility of meeting the national security technology
requirements within constrained economic resources as the end of the Cold War continues
to drive the Defense budget downward.
<P>
ARPA chose to utilize an unconventional strategy for this mission and called it the
Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP).  There are some unique characteristics of the TRP
that separate it from other technology development programs.  A requirement for partnership
has benefited both large and small industries by encouraging them to leverage each other's
strengths.  This also benefits the Services through the resulting economies of scale.  A
requirement for cost sharing spreads the risk among government and private participants and
enhances the sense of commitment on both sides.  Additionally, the TRP has its own contracting
authority outside the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  Thus, contract negotiations are
typically accomplished in a more efficient and streamlined manner.  This encourages more
participation by typically non-Defense firms, which have valuable commercial technologies
that can be adapted to Defense purposes.
<P>
This publication is the first to capture all of the projects that have been funded under the TRP.  
It includes both 1993 and 1994 winners, as well as some discussion about the new technology 
focus of 1995 and beyond.  Additionally, there are 24 detailed descriptions of projects, which 
are strong representations from technology development, where the TRP is significantly helping the
Services and the Department of Defense meet the challenges both of today and of the future.

<P>
The end of the Cold War has created a new set of challenges for the
Department of Defense (DoD)--how to stay militarily superior in the face of uncertain
threats, fiscal constraints, and revolutionary changes in the nature of modern
battle. One response to these challenges is the Technology Reinvestment Project
(TRP), led by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The TRP increases
the DoD's access to affordable advanced technology by leveraging commercial
technological progress for military benefit. And, perhaps as important, the TRP
is spreading this new way of doing business throughout the DoD.<P>
The TRP is a new approach to developing Defense technology--an approach
designed for a time when budgets are tight, the federal government is smaller,
and more and more of the best technology is being developed in the commercial,
not the Defense, sector. The program will provide technology to our armed
forces in such militarily important areas as military mobility, information
processing, and advanced electronics. And this technology will be more
affordable, available, and continuously improving because once created it will
stay embedded in the dynamic commercial marketplace.<P>
The TRP, as an integrated interservice program with critical mass, allows the
military services to be full partners with ARPA executing the program. The
DoD's traditional research and development (R&amp;D) approach will remain
indispensable for developing specifically military technology and integrating
dual-use technology into military systems like tanks and fighters. Thus the
TRP's leveraging strategy is a powerful addition to the R&amp;D methods of the
DoD.
<P><HR><H2><A NAME="RTFToC2">NEW MILITARY TECHNOLOGY, A NEW WAY </A></H2>
To have an affordable advanced defense, the DoD must find new, more flexible
ways to tap into the commercial sector's technological vitality.<P>
The TRP gives our armed forces technology that is more affordable, available,
and continuously improving because once created it will stay embedded in the
dynamic commercial marketplace.<P>
Cost sharing, teams, innovative agreements, and competitive selection are
central to the TRP.<P>
The TRP's innovative organizational structure allows it to tap into a vast
array of federal resources without a large permanent bureaucracy.<P>
The TRP is a catalyst for nuts-and-bolts changes in the DoD's approach to
R&amp;D.
<H3>Challenge-Continuing Strength Amid Changing Circumstances</H3>
With the demise of the Soviet Union, the U.S. military has shifted from a
global strategy against a global foe to a global strategy focused on regional
threats. These regional threats have created a whole new set of challenges,
particularly for operational flexibility. But despite all these changes,
leading-edge technology remains one linchpin of U.S. military superiority. It
allows our military missions to be completed more effectively and with the
fewest possible American casualties.<P>
Yet the world of technology, particularly Defense technology, has changed
radically in the past decade. The commercial sector has become increasingly
technologically sophisticated, partly through its interaction with the growing
global marketplace. For example, consider what is happening in computers,
telecommunications, and microelectronics. Overall, R&amp;D expenditures by
business in the United States are now more than double those by the DoD and
continue to increase. Meanwhile, tight DoD budgets are shrinking the
specialized Defense supplier base, and the federal government is under enormous
pressure to get leaner. This situation has created a number of forces shaping
the future of Defense technology.<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Today, much of the best emerging technology is in the commercial
sector.</B> Unfortunately, the DoD is unable to take advantage of much of
commercial R&amp;D because (1) the DoD is not actively involved with it or (2)
it is conducted with little regard to military needs. The days are gone when
the DoD could assume that it had or knew about all the most advanced technology
and that it commanded the attention of all the best technologists. Thus, the
DoD must find ways to work with the commercial sector whenever the best
technology is there. The alternative is to be left out, and left behind.<P>
<LI><B>With smaller Defense budgets, the cost of developing and producing
new Defense systems is more critical than ever</B>. The DoD can no longer
afford the overhead of maintaining a segregated "Defense-only" technology base
for all its needs. Since few entirely new military systems will be developed,
commercially derived upgrades are one way to stay on the cutting edge
affordably. In short, commercial production practices and economies of scale
are the keys to less costly Defense systems.<P>
<LI><B>A smaller federal government will have to be much more
flexible</B>. The federal government will need to shed its unique system of
esoteric rules, regulations, procedures, and requirements. New ways of doing
business will be essential to a leaner, more effective government.<P>
</UL>
Therefore, to have an affordable advanced defense, the DoD must find new, more
flexible ways to tap into the commercial sector's technological ideas,
investments, economies of scale, and vitality. By failing to do so, the DoD
runs the risk of becoming technologically obsolete, which would be costly in
dollars and, ultimately, lives.

<H3>...And Response:  Leveraging Commercial Technological Progress for Military Benefit</H3>
The TRP's basic strategy is to leverage commercial market size, technological
know-how, and investments for military benefit by entering into cost-shared
investments with private organizations. Most important, this involves
supporting R&amp;D projects to develop dual-use technology--technology needed
by both commercial and military customers. All parties share the risks and
benefits, so the intersection between military benefits and commercial
viability lies at the heart of the project. Under the TRP, the DoD becomes less
of a controlling planner assuming all the risk and writing all the rules.
Instead, it becomes a flexible seeker of technological opportunity and can
purposefully accommodate commercial investment interests, yielding affordable
advanced technology that is militarily useful.<P>
The TRP is a way to give our armed forces technology that is more affordable,
always available, and continuously improving. Once the technology is created it
will stay embedded in the dynamic commercial marketplace. The TRP's strategy
gives the DoD the involvement that can move a wider range of applicable
emerging commercial technology toward DoD's needs without disrupting its
commercial viability, and it makes some commercially oriented technologists
more aware of Defense needs and business opportunities. The strategy also
increases the amount of deliberately dual-use research--research aimed from the
start toward technology needed by both commercial and military customers. All
these benefits come with less direct control by a smaller, more flexible
government process.<P>
With procurement reform, more commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology can be
integrated into weapons and military support systems. But, in some cases, the
DoD will want to be involved with the initial development of the commercial
technology to ensure that it can meet its needs. The TRP encourages this
involvement with commercial R&amp;D without  inflexible, "government-only"
rules and requirements. In short, the TRP is one method of stocking tomorrow's
commercial shelves with militarily useful technology so that the DoD can find
it and use it when needed--all at a reasonable price.
<H3>Setting the Standards for a New Era</H3>
Several key features are central to the TRP's leveraging strategy.*<P>
<UL><LI><B>Cost Sharing.</B> The TRP pays no more than half the cost of
any project. This makes each project a risk-sharing investment of interest to all
the parties, not a sale to the government. Cost sharing is one way to ensure
that the team is committed to the project and believes that the technology is
commercially viable. It also encourages efficient and diligent project
management.<P>
<LI><B>Teams</B>. Typically, several organizations must come together for
a TRP project. TRP project teams regularly combine complementary talents from
the Defense and commercial sectors, academia, and nonprofit organizations. For
example, roughly 75 percent of the TRP's Technology Development projects
selected in the first competition include both a commercial firm and a Defense
firm. Moreover, teams can often address a broader set of problems than an
organization working alone. The TRP frequently hears that it has helped bring
together organizations that had not previously considered working together.<P>
<LI><B>Innovative Agreements.</B> The TRP is conducted outside the
Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). TRP projects are investment partnerships
that must be in the interest of all the parties; they are not procurements. A
TRP relationship requires more flexibility than a typical federal contract,
which assumes a buyer-seller relationship. FAR procedures would be both
inappropriate and too rigid for the TRP.<P>
Hence, the TRP uses cooperative agreements or ARPA's "other transactions" as
funding instruments for the overwhelming bulk of its work. These instruments,
particularly "other transactions," give the TRP flexibility in dealing with
intellectual property rights, and this helps attract firms that might not
otherwise deal with the government.<P>
<LI><B>Competitive Selection</B>. Even though the TRP is conducted
outside the FAR, by law every TRP project must be selected solely on its merits
through a fair and open competition. The TRP adheres to this requirement
rigorously and believes it is absolutely crucial to the quality and credibility
of the program. Every TRP project is selected without regard to geographic
location or any factor other than the published criteria.<P>
*Please note that cost sharing, teams, and innovative agreements do not apply
to the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) part of the TRP. SBIR is
conducted using FAR contracts and is discussed more later.</UL>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC6">Innovative Organizational Features</A></H3>
The TRP is managed with a lean organization that uses federal assets
temporarily, as needed, without a large permanent bureaucracy. For example,
more than 400 people have served as TRP proposal evaluators, but there are only
five ARPA staff dedicated full-time to the TRP.<P>
At the TRP's core is ARPA--the central R&amp;D arm of the DoD, attached to the
Office of the Secretary of Defense. ARPA is responsible for the TRP's budget
and leads the program. Its federal partners are the Army, Navy, and Air Force,
along with the Departments of Commerce, Energy, and Transportation; the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Science
Foundation. The military departments help ensure that the TRP continues
focusing on military problems and benefits. The eight partner agencies gain
access to technology and learn a new way of doing business while contributing
technical and managerial expertise. This DoD-led partnership forms the main TRP
umbrella under which other resources reside.<P>
The TRP is jointly planned under ARPA's leadership, but once individual
projects are selected they are assigned to the agency best suited to manage
them. That team helps publicize the competition, evaluates the proposals, and
is then responsible for managing the selected projects--tapping into additional
resources at the members' home agencies as needed.  Different teams come under
the TRP umbrella over time.
<H3>One Key to Spreading Dual-Use Throughout the DoD</H3>
The TRP is a clear signal both to the private sector and inside the Defense
Department that the DoD is serious about a new way of doing business--one based
on flexibility, common sense, and common interest instead of red tape and
government-only requirements. Bringing together the Army, the Navy, the Air
Force, and ARPA lets the TRP focus on technologies of value to many services,
while spreading a new way to develop technology throughout the DoD.<P>
By executing Technology Development projects through the military services, the
TRP is building a cadre of service people who understand how to leverage
commercial R&amp;D for military benefit. The TRP is working to create an
environment that encourages people to learn new methods. In this way, the TRP
can become a catalyst for nuts-and-bolts changes in the R&amp;D methods of all
the DoD's branches.
<P><HR><H2><A NAME="RTFToC8">THE TRP'S FOUR COMPETITION AREAS
</A></H2>
Overall, the TRP has selected 99 Technology Development projects to benefit the
military.<P>
More than 50 percent of the TRP's Technology Development projects have a small
business on the team.<P>
TRP's Technology Deployment and MET projects reinforce the skills of the small
manufacturers, engineers, and workers that are essential for the long-term
strength of our National Defense.
<H3>Covering Different Facets of Defense Technology</H3>
Building on its legislative foundation, the TRP has four major thrusts, often
referred to as competition areas: Technology Development, Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR), Technology Deployment, and Manufacturing Education
and Training (MET).* Each thrust covers a different facet of the DoD's total
technology base, and each works on a different timescale with different
players. Technology Development and the related SBIR thrust have a more
immediate impact on Defense. Technology Deployment and MET are much longer-term
programs and, consequently, affect Defense less directly. Although the DoD must
execute each authorized thrust, the TRP expects to emphasize Technology
Development and SBIR in the future.<P>
*SBIR has a much wider domain than the TRP; it affects all the federal
government's R&amp;D programs.<P>
<HR><H2><A NAME="RTFToC10">Technology Development</A></H2>
The core of the TRP is its cost-shared R&amp;D projects to develop dual-use
technology needed by both commercial and military customers. A typical project
lasts two years, potentially yielding a commercially viable technology or
product two to five years after the end of TRP funding. The DoD's funding
ensures that the commercial R&amp;D creates technology that will meet the
Department's special needs; in many cases, the R&amp;D would not even happen
without DoD support. Private firms pay for at least half of each project
because they see some potential for the technology to be commercially viable as
well. Commercial viability will eventually yield lower costs for the DoD as it
purchases military products using the technology. Thus, while the TRP's ends
are more affordable advanced Defense technology, commercial viability is its
means. This overall strategy yields two approaches, depending largely on the
state of the military technology:<P>
<UL><LI><B>Leveraging Emerging Commercial Technology</B>. The TRP taps
into the best emerging commercial technology and influences that technology so that
it can meet the DoD's special requirements, and it encourages dual-use R&amp;D
that might not otherwise occur. This approach begins by leveraging commercial
know-how and investments and eventually leverages market size to lower the
cost. Typically, the commercial sector is the technology leader here.<P>
<LI><B>Embedding Defense Technology</B>. The TRP encourages new
commercial uses for important existing defense technologies to lower their
price and sustain those that might otherwise disappear because of lack of DoD
demand. This strategy seeks commercial production efficiencies and leverages
commercial economies of scale. Defense is typically the technology leader
here.<P>
</UL>
Under the first approach, through TRP sponsorship, a digital X-ray system
suitable for the battlefield will be developed years sooner and at half the
cost by leveraging and shaping commercial interest in this area. Under the
second approach, projects to improve the DoD's uncooled infrared sensors and
use them in commercial applications could lower their price by a factor of 10.
Some projects combine both approaches. For example, diode-pumped lasers,
initially developed by ARPA, will be applied to the precision machining of new
advanced materials. The commercial uses of this precision machining technology
are numerous and will help improve manufacturing and lower costs for the DoD,
particularly in stealth materials, and will simultaneously improve and lower
cost of military lasers.<P>
The TRP has selected 99 Technology Development projects to benefit the military
in the following areas:<P>
<UL><LI>  Military Mobility and Deployment<P>
<LI>Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence
(C<SUP>4</SUP>I)<P>
<LI>Battlefield Sensors<P>
<LI>Casualty Treatment<P>
<LI>Electronics Design and Manufacturing<P>
<LI>Mechanical Systems and Materials<P>
<LI>Weapons Survivability Technologies<P>
</UL>
The TRP's Technology Development projects are usually aimed at materials,
components, and subsystems. System-level projects, such as the development of
tanks and submarines, tend to cost too much and lack the commercial viability
needed to make a good TRP project. However, the components of military systems
often do have commercial applications.<P>
As with any military R&amp;D program, it will take some time to know the final
results from all these projects, but the TRP is already seeing some promising
developments--each with direct military use.
<H3>Small Business Innovation Research</H3>
The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) thrust of the TRP is similar to
the Technology Development thrust in that it supports R&amp;D in dual-use
technologies, but it differs by being aimed specifically at small business.
Small businesses are often an excellent source of emerging technology and
entrepreneurial energy and participate quite heavily throughout all of the TRP.
For example, more than 50 percent of the TRP's Technology Development projects
have a small business on the team.<P>
To date, the TRP has funded 145 SBIR Phase I projects in the same technology
focus areas as its Technology Development projects. Moreover, the TRP has
implemented congressional changes in its cost-sharing rules to allow SBIR funds
to count as non-federal dollars, making small businesses more attractive team
members for TRP Technology Development projects. Through a recent change
allowing TRP SBIR proposals to be embedded in TRP Technology Development
proposals, even more small businesses are expected to participate in the TRP.
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC12">Technology Deployment</A></H3>
The TRP's Technology Deployment projects are designed to constantly renew and
upgrade the foundation of the DoD's manufacturing base--small manufacturers--by
giving them easy, cost-effective access to new technologies. The DoD's large
prime contractors rely on these thousands of small manufacturers.<P>
The TRP's 95 Technology Deployment projects are typically third-party service
providers that assist small manufacturers. These projects are of two broad
types. One type helps establish, expand, or enable manufacturing extension
centers or services. The other type gives small manufacturers better access to
technologies of interest to the DoD, particularly those developed in federal
laboratories.<P>
Since 1994, the TRP has been phasing out Technology Deployment activities and
has not sought any new Technology Deployment projects. At a national level,
deployment activities are being addressed at the Department of Commerce. No
additional TRP Technology Deployment competitions are expected.
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC13">Manufacturing Education and Training</A></H3>
The Manufacturing Education and Training (MET) thrust of the TRP is based on
the DoD's interest in having available a technologically skilled workforce that
can quickly design and manufacture what the DoD needs. During World War II,
America's unequaled skills in mass production made it capable of arming an
entire alliance and able to serve as the "Arsenal of Democracy." In the wake of
Sputnik, the DoD was a leader in improving scientific and technical education
because it knew that new weapons rested on new knowledge. In the 21st century,
the DoD will rely more on commercial manufacturing to meet its needs,
particularly during a crisis; it will be difficult to reconstitute our forces
without strong commercial manufacturing skills.<P>
Yet America is no longer the unquestioned leader in manufacturing, partly
because of how it educates its engineers. Today, the TRP's 57 MET projects are
strengthening the manufacturing skills the DoD needs. One group of MET projects
is helping to reshape U.S. engineering education to emphasize design and
manufacturing. This usually involves revising curricula to make them more
relevant to industrial practices. Another group of MET projects is upgrading
and retraining the technical workforce, particularly those displaced by Defense
downsizing. This preserves and improves the skills of these workers. While MET
accounts for only a small portion of the TRP and is less likely to appear in
future competitions, it will yield solid, long-term returns to the nation.
<P><HR><H2><A NAME="RTFToC14">A CHRONOLOGY OF CHANGE</A></H2>
The TRP estimates that the project teams will contribute around $1 billion in
other resources to execute the projects.<P>
The TRP is continuing to emphasize military benefits.<P>
The TRP will work to make actively leveraging commercial R&amp;D for military
benefit a commonly accepted and understood practice through-out the Defense
R&amp;D system.
<H3>Foundations</H3>
The TRP has changed considerably since 1993. It initially developed directly
from provisions in the Defense Conversion, Reinvestment, and Transition Act of
1992, which assigned the DoD several statutory programs related to technology.
ARPA managers saw that many of the statutes were complementary and decided to
execute them as an integrated whole, the TRP.  Eight statutory programs were
grouped into the three thrusts described previously:  Technology Development,
Technology Deployment, and Manufacturing Education and Training; the Small
Business Innovation Research thrust was added to improve the program's link to
small businesses.<P>
This integrated approach created a single, clearly visible target for
proposers. Given the TRP's size, particularly with respect to ARPA, legislated
coordination requirements, and the variety of expertise it required, ARPA
utilized federal agencies. An integrated interagency approach, while more
difficult to coordinate, has turned out to be one of the assets of the program.
In fact, many people involved with the TRP believe that interservice and
interagency cooperation has been one of the project's most rewarding aspects,
creating bridges for the exchange of ideas.
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC16">Milestones, Competitions, and Top-Level Statistics</A></H3>
To date, the TRP has completed two competitions; a third is ongoing. The major
milestones in the program are shown below:<P>

	<P>
To reach outside the traditional Defense research community and find emerging
commercial technologies that the military can use, the TRP maintains a
toll-free telephone number, a World Wide Web site, and a mailing list of more
than 60,000 contacts. A series of workshops and presentations across the
country accompanies every new TRP competition, and the TRP has sponsored two
special conferences on strategic partnerships called "A New Way of Doing
Business in the 1990s." To date, more than 20,000 organizations have applied to
the program.<P>
The following table gives an overall summary of the TRP's activities in this
area. The funds listed below are TRP funds only, which are less than half the
cost of every project. The TRP estimates that the project teams will contribute
around $1 billion in other resources to execute those projects. Overall, the
TRP has almost 2,000 participants, including roughly 1,000 firms, 470
universities and educational institutions, and 140 state and local
organizations.<P>

<H3>Evolution of the Program</H3>
Over the past year, the TRP has made a concerted effort to increase the number
of militarily relevant proposals it receives. After the first competition, it
was evident that much of the proposal community did not understand the
relationship between the TRP's means (commercial viability) and its ends
(affordable advanced military technology). Many of the proposers incorrectly
perceived the TRP as a "defense conversion" program designed solely to help
people affected by Defense downsizing. As a result, the TRP received many
inappropriate proposals. This problem may have stemmed from a number of
factors--the broad array of the TRP's activities, the expectations and rhetoric
generated in a time of some economic distress, and the TRP's difficulty in
clearly communicating its Defense objectives.<P>
The TRP has attempted to solve this problem by sharpening its overall message
to the proposal community. The project is emphasizing pointedly that its aim is
military, not economic, benefits. As a result, the second competition had a
greater proportion of militarily beneficial technologies proposed. The TRP
expects this to be true also for the ongoing, third competition.<P>
In its push to increase the public prominence of the TRP's military objectives,
the program has also taken the following steps:<P>
<UL><LI>Issued tighter and more detailed descriptions of its technology
focus areas so that military applications and benefits are clearer<P>
<LI>Increased the participation of the military services in the selection
of technology focus areas and the administration of the competitions<P>
<LI>Instituted a "concept paper" process to give feedback on ideas before
a full proposal is written, partly to alert people that their proposals might
have  inadequate Defense benefits<P>
<LI>Phased out those areas that benefit the DoD less immediately or
directly or that another agency might handle better (for example, Technology
Deployment).</UL>
<H3>Where the TRP Is Going</H3>
In the fall and winter of 1995, the TRP plans to select the next round of new
projects. Part of the funds for those projects will come from the FY 1996
appropriation. The remainder of the FY 1996 budget will support a fourth TRP
competition and the continuation of existing projects. This fourth competition
will most likely emphasize Technology Development and Small Business Innovation
Research projects. Throughout this period, the TRP will continue to work even
more closely with the military services to select and manage new technology
focus areas and new projects. Over the next few years, the TRP will work to
make actively leveraging commercial R&amp;D for military benefit a commonly
accepted and understood practice throughout the Defense R&amp;D system.

On battlefield, seas, and air, the ability to mobilize, deploy, and sustain
military operations hinges on transportation and maneuvers. Recognizing this
important requirement, the TRP is finding ways to bring commercial technologies
to bear on military transport and vehicle needs. This program is advancing and
making land vehicle technologies--such as electric and hybrid vehicles and
navigation and safety systems--more affordable. It is combining the expertise
of naval systems producers and commercial shipbuilders to develop efficient
ways to build naval ships. And it is looking toward advanced aeronautical
technologies that will contribute to air superiority well into the 21st century.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 alt="Tank" SRC="image/ch1_milland.gif">
With more than a million military vehicles run by the Army and Marine Corps alone, 
the DoD has the most complex, if not the largest, fleet of land vehicles
in the United States. For our military to maintain its superiority, this fleet
must become more efficient, more advanced, and more affordable. By exploiting
commercial technologies and influencing commercial developers, the TRP can
further these goals.<P>
The TRP's approach is allowing military utility vehicles to benefit directly
from advances in commercial vehicle technology, such as better electric and
hybrid drive components, land navigation, and safety systems. And it is also
addressing less obvious--but equally beneficial--commercial technology links in
areas such as tactical and armored combat vehicles, where there are fewer, but
important, commercial sector connections.<P>
While little advanced electric drive technology is found in government
laboratories or the Defense industries, these technologies are still very
important to the military. Therefore, it is only natural for the military to
join with the commercial sector, which--driven by goals of reducing emissions
and fuel consumption--has become an active participant in what may become one
of the world's largest markets. If developed with military needs in mind,
component technologies for alternators, electric motors, power switches,
batteries, and converters can solve electric power problems on the battlefield.
They will offer vehicle design flexibility and ultimately be critical for the
realization of hybrid propulsion.<P>

While international shipbuilding is currently strong, the nation's shipbuilding
industry is on the verge of collapse, with commercial capabilities essentially
nonexistent. The U.S. shipbuilding industry has been assisted by large DoD
shipbuilding efforts for many years. But with Defense downsizing, current and
projected Navy combatant/auxiliary ship construction is insufficient to
maintain the industrial shipbuilding capacity required for mobilization. The
TRP is funding efforts to preserve a viable military shipbuilding

The United States enjoys a dominant position in the world aircraft market
because of the distinct technological advantage won by a strong R&amp;D
investment strategy--especially in the Defense sector. However, this
preeminence is now being aggressively challenged by both Europe and Asia. The
TRP is funding several areas that will provide significant payoffs for both the
Defense and commercial sectors.<P>
For example, the TRP is addressing low-cost ways to manufacture selected
components and increase the use of composite materials (see also the Mechanical
Systems and Materials section of this report). Designed primarily for
Defense-related propulsion systems, such technologies will ultimately improve
performance and lower costs for military aircraft. The TRP is also looking at
Fly-by-Light technology, developing dramatically lighter and more capable
aircraft systems and avionics by exploiting advanced optical technologies for
aircraft and propulsion controls, actuators, and sensor systems. Optical
technology also is not affected by electromagnetic interference and so
eliminates signal scrambling that can occur over conventional wires.<P>
In the area of advanced materials, low-cost fabrication, and structural
concepts, there are opportunities for high payoff, where unit costs can be
significantly reduced (such as advanced materials placement and molding
processing, assembly and joining processes, and tooling equipment
demonstrations). In addition, the TRP is taking a close look at aircraft design
to reduce the design process time and provide a coherent design methodology
integrated with the manufacturing processes and logistics infrastructure.<P>

<H2><A NAME="chap1-4">TURBOALTERNATOR PAVES WAY FOR ELECTRIC HYBRID
VEHICLES</A></H2> <IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 alt="Turboalternator" 
SRC="image/ch1_turbo.gif">PROJECT TITLE: Turboalternator for Electric Hybrid Vehicles<P> With the turboalternator, 
the tank burns much less fuel. The enemy also has a
harder time detecting it with infrared sensors because the turbo-alternator's
small, energy- efficient engine emits less heat.<P>
As a second phase of the TRP activity, 
AlliedSignal and GM Hughes Electronics
are incor-porating the turboalternator into a commercial hybrid-electric bus.<P>
Army tanks typically get less than half a mile to the gallon and guzzle fuel
even when idling.  With this level of consumption, fuel supply is a big concern
on the battlefield. These inefficiencies and the large engine (or turbine)
required for mobility result in acoustic and thermal signatures that make a
tank easier to detect, greatly reducing its ability to survive on the
battlefield.<P>
In response, ARPA is developing a new technology called the Hybrid Electric
Drivetrain (HED), which can be used for both the military and the commercial
sector. In an HED, the vehicle is electrically propelled from either a battery
or a flywheel; a small engine drives a generator called a turboalternator,
which recharges the battery or flywheel.
<H3>
Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions
</H3>
HEDs offer several advantages to the military. For example, the smaller engine
makes the vehicle quieter and more fuel efficient and gives the vehicle a lower
thermal signature. For another, turning the engine off and running only on
batteries makes the propulsion system very stealthy. In addition, the
turboalternator can provide electric power for nonpropulsion purposes such as
communications, life support, or weapons.<P>
Through the TRP, the CALSTART consortium is developing an advanced
turboalternator to power an HED. The turboalternator was demonstrated last fall
as an auxiliary power unit (APU) on an M1A1 military tank at the Fort Knox Army
Testing Facility. "The demonstration went exceedingly well," commented Charles
Weinstein, director of advanced technologies at AlliedSignal. "We were able to
provide electric power to operate onboard vehicle systems without having to
keep the main engines on or running down the battery."
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
Turboalternators are gas turbines that drive an electric generator. They allow
vehicles to use batteries or flywheels during acceleration and operate directly
from the turboalternator while cruising. The turboalternator's innovative
design includes air bearings (no oil required), a two-pole toothless permanent
magnet generator with an efficiency of 95 percent, and no gearbox. The
turboalternator also has an air bleed capability that can be used to run the
nuclear, biological, and chemical decontamination overpressure system. It has
already been tested for more than 186 hours, and lessons learned are being fed
back into design changes.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
A bus sitting idle in heavy traffic burns fuel inefficiently, and emissions
become a big problem, especially in large cities. As a second phase of the TRP
activity, AlliedSignal and GM Hughes Electronics are incorporating the
turboalternator into a commercial hybrid-electric bus. Producing the
turboalternator commercially will make the device much cheaper and more
accessible for the Defense sector.<P>
According to CALSTART president and CEO Michael Gage, the turboalternator's
operations make electricity production "exceedingly clean and highly reliable,
which makes it ideal for both transportation and military uses." When used in a
commercial hybrid bus, the turboalternator gives the bus the flexibility to run
in congested city streets or on stretches of open highway. While an electric
battery is the main power source, the turboalternator generates electricity
that recharges the battery on the fly. As a result, the turboalternator gives
the bus much better range and power.<P>
The CALSTART design is intended to meet the need for a low-cost turbine that
has good fuel economy and meets commercial requirements. The level of emissions
in this role is predicted to be 70 times less than the ultralow-emission
<BR>vehicle standard for nitrogen oxide, 80 times less than that for
hydrocarbons, and 170 times less than that for carbon monoxide. The commercial
hybrid application demands efficiencies and refinements that will be passed on
to the military APU version. Gains in affordability and availability will be
particularly important in expanding its use to other military vehicles, such as
the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
This project will develop a 23-kilowatt turboalternator and design a
50-kilowatt unit that can be used in hybrid vehicles and as APUs for the Army's
M1A1 tank. The APU will be quiet and efficient power with a low infrared
signature so that electronic systems can be used without running the tank's
large turbine engines. Commercial use ensures low cost. A successful early
prototype demonstration in October 1994 sponsored by the Army's Battlelabs
elicited enthusiastic comments from the Army.

<A NAME="chap1-5">BATH IRON WORKS LOWERS THE COST OF
SHIPBUILDING</A></H2> 

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 allt="Destroyer" SRC="image/ch1_bath.gif">PROJECT TITLE:
Commercial Shipbuilding Focused Development Project<P> As a result of this TRP activity, 
Bath Iron Works estimates it could save more
than $15 million annually on the construction of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class
destroyers. <P>
 The importance of sea power to the national security strategy of the
United States increased dramatically during the superpower era of the Cold War.
Throughout this period, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. shipbuilding industry
developed a partnership that produced a U.S. fleet that was second to none. In
recent years, however, while the Navy's need to exhibit military might on the
sea has not diminished, the Navy can no longer support this partnership at the
level it once did. Consequently, resources once readily available for military
purposes throughout the shipbuilding industry are quickly disappearing.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
What the Navy now requires is the ability to tap into U.S. shipbuilding
resources as needed so that the military can quickly construct and repair ships
using advanced materials, designs, and skilled labor--all at an affordable
cost. Through a TRP activity aimed at diversifying commercial shipbuilding,
Bath Iron Works is attempting to create an environment that will allow the Navy
to do just that. This activity, conducted under the title "Commercial
Shipbuilding Focused Development Project," is aimed at increasing manufacturing
and management efficiency, lowering ship construction costs, and maintaining a
highly skilled workforce. As a result of this TRP activity, Bath Iron Works
estimates it could save more than $15 million annually on the construction of
DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
One example of technologies being developed through the TRP is a special design
that will give ship loaders "roll-on and roll-off" capabilities. These
capabilities allow crews to load mat&eacute;riel with vehicles rather than
cargo nets, so loading is faster and cheaper. In addition, the TRP program is
developing design processes using conventional materials to make heavy decks
for ships. These decks will be able to withstand pressures of many tons per
square foot and will be able to withstand additional pressures when applied at
given points, such as from the four wheels of a vehicle.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
The drive to seek value when investing limited resources has motivated the Navy
as well as the shipbuilding industry to investigate once again the feasibility
of U.S. shipbuilders' competing in the commercial marketplace. Bath Iron Works
determined that it could gain valuable experience and expertise in the
commercial shipbuilding market by participating in a series of technology
transfer activities with recognized world-class commercial shipbuilders. This
experience would be integrated with the company's existing U.S. Navy
shipbuilding expertise to create an enhanced dual-use Navy-commercial
shipbuilding capability, incorporating the best process technologies from both
sides of the business. Integration and implementation of these world-class
processes at Bath Iron Works are largely responsible for the projected savings
on the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyer program.<P>
Commercial ship design expertise, shipyard modernization plans, and other
commercial shipbuilding process technologies from world-class foreign
shipbuilders are being analyzed to determine the best way of enhancing Bath
Iron Works' competitiveness in future Navy and commercial shipbuilding markets.
If these efforts are successful, overall costs will be reduced for the
company's Navy ship construction programs, and Bath's chances for reentry into
the international commercial shipbuilding market will be greatly improved.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
Bath recently negotiated a very successful labor agreement in which both
management and labor have committed to a partnership to move the company into
the commercial market while maintaining its Defense capabilities. This will
allow Bath to use commercial best practices in design, manufacturing,
production, and management to reduce costs to the Navy and be commercially
competitive. Through the TRP project, Bath has already realized some of these
objectives, and the Navy has witnessed significant savings in its DDG-51
program. This project should produce even more benefits as Bath continues to
integrate the new processes and procedures.<P>
<HR><A NAME="chap1-6"><H2>FLASH IMPROVES RELIABILITY AND SURVIVABILITY
OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT</H2></A>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 alt=""Fly By Wire Aircraft" SRC="image/ch1_flash.gif">PROJECT
TITLE: Fly-by-Light Advanced Systems Hardware Program<P> Incorporating fiber optics into 
the design of the F-22 can make the aircraft
lighter and less vulnerable to electromagnetic interference.<P>
Performance and survivability are important concerns of today's military pilots
for completing missions--concerns that can be addressed through fiber optics.
While fiber-optic technology is often associated with the telecommunications
industry, it also offers bright new prospects for tomorrow's military
aircraft.<P>
McDonnell Douglas is leading a project called FLASH, short for Fly-by-Light
Advanced Systems Hardware, which replaces conventional aircraft control and
mission management systems with fiber optics. This project is addressing the
problems of today's aircraft, which are now using more complex, highly
integrated avionics and control systems.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
Because aircraft control systems are now heavily computerized, they must have
reliable digitized signals--signals that currently run over conventional wires.
These signals are essential for the aircraft to operate safely and perform well
in combat. But with conventional wires, they can be vulnerable. Electromagnetic
interference, whether intentional (by the enemy) or accidental (from outside
communications sources, for example), can scramble these digital signals and
cause dangerous aircraft failures. Shielding is the normal solution, but it is
heavy, bulky, and expensive.<P>
Since FLASH uses optical signals that are not susceptible to this phenomenon,
it can protect the control systems of our military aircraft affordably. It also
can reduce aircraft weight. In fact, reduced filament weight, along with the
lower weight of the control system, is expected to save about 6,000 pounds on
each aircraft. Such weight reductions allow military aircraft to carry larger
payloads or travel farther on a fuel load. These technologies also increase
aircraft reliability and maintainability by about 10 percent and eliminate the
costs and weight of heavy shielding. FLASH technology is targeted for the
F-22--the Air Force's newest and most sophisticated fighter.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
The FLASH team's cost-effective and reliable fiber-optic cable manufacturing
process meets Federal Aviation Administration requirements and enables the
implementation of optical technology to reduce costs. The team is also
developing a low-cost flight control system using innovative FLASH-based
sensors and control links, including an innovative process for control system
design. In addition, the team is developing actuators that improve reliability
and maintainability.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
To maintain a competitive edge through efficiency and lower cost, the FLASH
team is leveraging existing commercial products and developing new products
with commercial potential. This TRP partnership is critical to bringing to
fruition a wide acceptance of Fly-by-Light and power-by-wire aviation systems.
While the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the U.S. Navy, and the
U.S. Air Force have funded these technologies, there are still many gaps that
need to be filled. Through knowledge of these separate programs, the TRP can
fill the gaps in these existing programs and leverage the technology through an
integrated approach. For instance, the partnership is developing a fiber-optic
cable plant to make aircraft-quality integrated fiber-optic backbones. They are
also tying together optical standards for control and sensor systems that can
be applied to both military and commercial applications.<P>
By reducing a 10-year development effort to 4 years, the TRP is allowing U.S.
firms to respond quickly to rising international competition in this area.
"We've always had a Fly-by-Light internal research and development program,"
comments Carlos Bedoya, a FLASH manager at McDonnell Douglas, "but with the
TRP, we've been able to double the bang for the buck so we can do things in
half the time.... At the end of the 2 years, we'll have everything ready to
fly."
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
Both the F-22 and Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program offices are
partners in FLASH to provide a near-term opportunity for incorporation of FLASH
innovations. They will closely follow the design, development, and
demonstration of a prototype system that integrates current optical systems
into the FLASH architecture. Future versions of the F-22 and JAST can then
quickly take advantage of the FLASH-proven designs.<P>
<A NAME="chap1-7"><HR></A><H2>ADVANCED LANDING SYSTEM HELPS MILITARY RULE THE
WEATHER</H2><P> 
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 alt="Automated Landing System" SRC="image/ch1_landing.gif">
PROJECT TITLE:  Autonomous Landing Guidance<P> The autonomous landing guidance system 
will prevent weather from affecting strategic decisions for the military.<P>
Incorporating the technology into commercial aircraft should make it cheaper
and easier for the military to access this technology through mass
production.<P>
In low-visibility conditions such as fog and smoke, sometimes called category
III conditions, the military and commercial sectors experience delays that
disrupt operations, since pilots typically rely on their eyes for takeoff and
landing. Such disruptions cause major losses--strategic, economic, and
sometimes in life.<P>
Lear Astronics Corporation is leading a TRP-funded effort to reduce the risks
of delays and diversions that poor visibility may cause. Its technology, called
the Autonomous Landing Guidance (ALG) system, will allow pilots to land their
aircraft in fog, smoke, and other obscurants.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
Like commercial pilots, military pilots rely on their eyes when taking off and
landing. Therefore, poor visibility has a tremendous impact on military
operations. And when bad weather strikes, strategic decision makers must decide
whether a mission should be executed. With ALG, weather will have much less
impact on strategic decisions.<P>
One critical aspect of military operations in which ALG could help is the
transport of mat&eacute;riel and troops. Delivering supplies to the soldiers,
picking up casualties, and transporting soldiers to a site are critical if U.S.
troops are to succeed in battle. Delivery of food, fuel, and ammunition is
time-sensitive; soldiers in battle cannot wait for weather to break to receive
such supplies. ALG will ensure that bad weather will not delay military
aircraft delivering such goods.<P>
In addition, ALG may make poor weather an ally for tactical missions. Because
the enemy will not be able to detect the aircraft with electro-optic systems,
the technology will enable surprise attacks.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
With ALG, pilots fly the aircraft with information displayed on their head-up
display (HUD). The HUD is a projection unit that displays information on a
piece of glass in front of the cockpit window. The display gives the pilot all
the performance data needed for flying and landing the aircraft. With ALG, an
integrated complement of weather-penetrating sensors, including a revolutionary
millimeter-wave imaging radar coupled with infrared sensors, is mounted on the
aircraft. These sensors provide a visual image of the runway overlaid on the
HUD, so the pilot can see through the weather with all aircraft performance
information within the same out-the-window viewing area.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
The ALG Consortium should save time, money, and even lives for military and
commercial users alike. By incorporating the technology into commercial
aircraft, the effort should make it cheaper and easier for the military to
access ALG technology through mass production.  ALG will also help the airlines
and air traffic controllers, who are battling their own tight schedules for
takeoff and landing. Every year, about 24,000 flights are delayed by
weather-caused congestion, representing more than $1 billion in revenue lost to
the U.S. airlines.<P>
According to the ALG Consortium, the TRP has done more than accelerate the
development of this technology. It has also allowed consortium members to share
industry and government expertise, providing "a unique, yet productive use of
our national private and government resources." For example, a cooperative
relationship with the government laboratories was quickly formed, which
provided the expertise needed in millimeter-wave and infrared technology. The
TRP cut years of bidding and soliciting required to obtain the laboratories'
expertise through traditional channels.<P>
The government has been developing all-weather sensor technology, spurred by
advances in smart munitions to increase all-weather visibility. Another
program, called synthetic vision systems, conducted jointly with the U.S. Air
Force, the Federal Aviation Administration, and Lear Astronics, demonstrated
the feasibility of millimeter-wave sensing of runways in bad weather. The TRP
is now bringing this research to fruition.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
ALG-related technologies are currently being developed and demonstrated. The
success of this program will ensure that the DoD can sustain flight operations
and deliver munitions in bad weather or during battlefield obstruction.<P>

<P>
In this post-Cold War era, even the most primitive country may have
forces armed with powerful and sophisticated weapons. Under such scenarios,
small conflicts can quickly turn into large-scale battles. U.S. troops are
usually deployed in unfamiliar territory with a differing culture, and they may
have difficulty operating under such confusing and dangerous circumstances.<P>
This scenario places great stress on the military's command, control,
communications, computers, and intelligence (C<SUP>4</SUP>I) systems. These
systems are designed to help the military efficiently strategize and activate
plans under such circumstances. C<SUP>4</SUP>I systems allow troops to quickly
set up and operate by gathering, verifying, sorting, and analyzing information
to construct appropriate strategies. Decision makers can then disseminate the
processed information and orders and coordinate resulting tactical
components.<P>
The TRP is addressing some of the most pervasive needs of all Services in the
area of C<SUP>4</SUP>I: advanced communications, information systems, and
computers. Since the best of these advances are generally being developed in
the commercial sector, the military must work with industry to achieve its
goals efficiently and affordably. Therefore, the TRP is sponsoring
collaborative efforts that will give the military a reliable source of low-cost
technology and ensure that future C<SUP>4</SUP>I systems are simple and
inexpensive to update. The following section describes the TRP's activities to
improve C<SUP>4</SUP>I systems using communications technology, computer
hardware, and computer software with military needs in mind.<P>
<HR><p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="image/approach.gif">
<H2>COMMUNICATIONS</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch2_comms.gif">The TRP strategy addresses
broadband, networked communications systems that improve the information 
infrastructure--because, without these systems, other
components of C<SUP>4</SUP>I, such as command and control, are mute and
ineffective. In communications, the military has been driven by several needs:
a need for more information, a need to digitize the battlefield, and a need for
wireless communications systems. The military also requires greater bandwidth,
which demands fiber-optic systems, new computers, and display and high-density
storage systems that support data and images. The project's activities for
developing such components and integrating various media, such as wireless,
fiber, cable, and satellites, cover nearly all facets of communications.<P>
For example, the TRP's efforts in wireless technologies can provide many
Defense benefits.  Supporting such military thrusts as digitizing the
battlefield, the efforts not only will improve C<SUP>4</SUP>I systems but also
weapons, survivability, and casualty treatment. But while the military's need
for such secure, digitally networked, high-data-rate, and updatable systems is
well documented, it has become infeasible for the Services to develop, produce,
and maintain special military communications equipment.<P>
The military has difficulties in this area partly because wireless
communications requires technology that the military does not have:
very-high-bandwidth communications networks. It is forecast that by 2000
Defense will need tens to hundreds of terabytes of data per day.  Just
beginning to install a 155-million-bit-per-second network, Defense researchers
are already finding out that this technology is very costly. Without leveraging
the communications expertise of the commercial sector, it will be impossible
for the Services to affordably develop, produce, and maintain wireless
technology on their own.<P>
The TRP's approach is making a difference in this and other communications
areas. In the past, the military set the protocols through the National
Information Infrastructure Interoperability (NII), which began as ARPANET in
the 1960s. But, expanding exponentially, the NII is now paced by commercial
growth, with the commercial sector setting protocols for wireless
communications. The DoD can no longer unilaterally control this growth but
instead must work with the commercial sector to develop the NII protocols. This
use will occur only if emerging capabilities are compatible with DoD
requirements. The TRP approach, therefore, is designed to push the commercial
capabilities of the NII in communications to maximize the benefit to Defense.<P>
In fiscal year 1995, the TRP is also beginning a new research program to be
conducted with the Army.  The goal of this program, Digital Wireless
Communications Technologies for Mobile Stations, is to maintain near-perfect
real-time knowledge of the enemy and communicate that to all forces in
near-real time.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch2_hw.gif">In response to improved
C<SUP>4</SUP>I capabilities, the TRP is focusing on the commercial sector to develop high-definition displays, high-density
storage, and advanced batteries. This approach is expected to initially impact
the information server market and Defense needs. Later it will impact the large
emerging computer multimedia market (estimated to be $10 billion by 2003).<P>
Today's battlefield is typified by a flood of data--data that must be organized
and interpreted before anyone can understand or use it. Technologies such as
flat-panel and helmet-mounted displays will allow combatants to access and make
sense of the data so that they can proceed with their missions. But to obtain
displays that meet Defense needs, the military must be involved early in
development efforts.<P>
Military displays differ from high-volume commercial displays because they must
be usable in desert-to-arctic temperatures and clearly legible in sunlight and
at night. Affordably fulfilling such needs is difficult today, since the
commercial sector is largely setting the pace for display development. In fact,
one of the world's dominant flat-panel display manufacturers refuses to work
with specialized DoD requirements.<P>
The TRP is also addressing dual-use technologies for digital images, video, and
multimedia programs, fueling the demand for cost-effective high-density digital
data storage. These technologies can be used, for example, by the Defense
Mapping Agency for greater storage capacity to provide maps with greater
detail--detail of great importance to tactical and strategic operations. In
addition, the TRP is funding activities for rugged, reliable, and small power
systems such as batteries, capacitors, and lightweight generators that can be
used in portable electronic devices. This area is of interest to both Defense
and the commercial sector.<P>

<HR><H2>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</H2>    
The military has an increasing need for better-quality software and more
productive ways to develop, maintain, and build large-scale software systems.
Large-scale software systems are developed, maintained, and upgraded only
through a long, labor-intensive process.  However, innovations such as
object-oriented programming promise to increase the productivity of software
developers, accelerating the development of new information services.<P>
Object technology is one example where the military and commercial sector can
mutually benefit. One area addressed by object technologies is among the most
difficult challenges in the military: the management of battlefield
information. Battlefield information management demands flexibility, rapid
growth, and modularity--all qualities inherent in object-based software
techniques, which are certain to be used in future battlefield management. Key
innovations needed include support for reusable components and the ability to
specify new components using high-level languages and integrated graphical
interfaces. Programs sponsored by the TRP are ensuring military pertinence in
developed technology and early application to military needs.<P>

<A NAME="chap2-2"><H2>DIGITAL SYSTEM IMPROVES MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS DURING A
CRISIS</H2></A> 
PROJECT TITLE: Experminental SONET Optical Carrier-192 and
Asynchronous Transfer Mode Self-Healing Ring<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SONET/ATM is fast and reliable enough to handle the surges in
communications that occur during a military crisis.<P>
Without commercial involvement, the military risks developing a system that
will soon be outstripped by commercial technology.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
During a crisis, military leaders need constant access to timely, accurate
information and the ability to immediately transmit their orders to the field.
The demands that these crisis-time surges place on modern communications
systems dwarf today's commercial requirements. According to the DoD, real-time
intelligence requires digital communications networks that can transmit 10 to
100 terabytes of data each day, equivalent to a throughput of 10 gigabits per
second (Gb/s) or higher--100 times as fast as today's commercial network
throughputs.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
To meet these daunting military requirements, the TRP is sponsoring the
Bellcore-led SONET/ATM Self-Healing Ring Consortium. SONET/ATM aims "to
demonstrate the feasibility of the next-generation Synchronous Optical Network
(SONET)," according to Dr. Nim K. Cheung of Bellcore. SONET is a digital
traffic management system based on international standards, while ATM, or
asynchronous transfer mode, is a digital transmission method that is the basis
for multimedia communications protocols. Together, they represent an
intrinsically compatible system that the military can use to handle
simultaneous voice, image, and other data transmission over fiber-optic lines.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
An important feature of the SONET/ATM system is the ability to transmit
multimedia data at very high rates; this activity aims to meet the 10-Gb/s
requirements of the DoD. Another important feature is its self-healing ring,
which allows data transmission to be instantly rerouted around a failed network
node. As a result, this system can survive optical fiber cuts and other node
failures--an important concern to the military, since these failures are most
likely to occur in a crisis, when it needs information most.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
While many of this system's features exceed today's commercial requirements,
this is a field in which commercial needs and technology are moving fast.  If
the military tries to develop such a system on its own, it risks spending too
much for a system that is soon outstripped by commercial technology. This has
already happened once with the DoD's AUTOVON communications system, which was
quickly outpaced by commercial telephone systems.<P>
To prevent a similar episode, the SONET/ATM Self-Healing Ring Consortium has
worked hard to find common ground with commercial concerns. Many of the
participants in this consortium have echoed the viewpoint of Jerry Mayer,
chairman and CEO of Tektronix, who has said that SONET/ATM technology will be
critical to the further development of the National Information Infrastructure.
For instance, video on demand, multimedia entertainment, interactive video
transmission, and telemedicine will all be enhanced by SONET/ATM.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
The early work of the consortium is living up to this promise. Already it has
produced a computer-controlled, robust laser transmitter and an optical
receiver that operate at 10 Gb/s. The consortium has also demonstrated a
10-Gb/s multiplexer and framer integrated circuit, both of which are key
components of the SONET system.<P>
The accomplishments of the consortium have called forth draft contributions to
establish national and international 10-Gb/s SONET standards; this is a
necessary prelude to commercial development. By setting such standards, a
strong commercial base of SONET/ATM users may emerge to meet Defense
requirements. Therefore, a robust commercial marketplace could support future
Defense needs in this area.<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="chap2-3"><H2>ADVANCED BATTERIES ENABLE LIGHTWEIGHT, BETTER PERFORMING
MILITARY SYSTEMS</H2></A>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch2_battery.gif">PROJECT TITLES:
Lithium Ion Rechargeable Battery Development and Deployment<P> 
PROJECT TITLES: High-Capacity, Solid Polymer Battery Development<P>
These activities will reduce the weight of equipment and simplify the logistics
of replacing used batteries.<P>
By funding two battery projects, the TRP seeks an interim cost-effective
solution while exploring a longer-range, higher-payoff option.<P>
Because most of today's military batteries are not rechargeable, they make up a
large part of the consumables used on the battlefield. If they could be
replaced by high-energy-density, long-life, rechargeable batteries, field units
would benefit greatly. Equipment powered by batteries would weigh less, and the
logistics of replacing used batteries would be simplified.  Improved batteries
would reduce operation and maintenance costs and improve the performance of
radios and other battery-powered devices. The costs and environmental impact of
disposing of such batteries would also be avoided.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
To pursue these benefits, the TRP has funded two approaches to developing
lithium ion batteries, which store more energy (per unit volume or weight) than
today's most widely used batteries, including nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal
hydride batteries. Lithium ion batteries are also safer and more
environmentally benign and could be less expensive for the military.<P>
Despite these advantages, some technical barriers to widespread use of lithium
ion batteries still exist. For example, previous versions are not large enough
and have not met stringent commercial or Defense requirements for power or
longevity. In addition, they do not charge uniformly if the cells in the
battery are at different stages of discharge. Both of the TRP- supported
efforts are trying to remedy these problems.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
Saft America is leading the first of these efforts for the TRP. This project is
working to improve the manufacturing and "intelligent charging" of small
lithium ion batteries, with applications in both the military and consumer
markets.<P>
The second effort, led by Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Company, is a
higher-risk project that is designing a new electrolyte material for lithium
ion batteries. This material, a solid polymer, increases battery voltages,
prevents electrolyte leakage, avoids pressure buildup (and the possibility of
explosion), allows more recharging cycles, and increases cell life. The
Lockheed team is also designing batteries in prismatic (i.e., rectangular)
shapes; for the military, there are important logistical advantages in
packaging rectangular shapes.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
The rechargeable, high-energy-density batteries that result from these efforts
not only will give military field units lighter, more reliable Command,
Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence equipment, but will also
find use in commercial and military satellites. Consumer applications include
portable telephones and laptop computers. By funding efforts that will meet the
needs of many users, the TRP will expand the market for lithium ion batteries.
The resulting economies of scale will lower costs for the military.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
As an immediate payoff, the Saft-led effort will deliver several hundred small
cells and batteries to the Army for tests in radios and other communications
equipment, built in a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. But the TRP's
strategy of funding two parallel efforts--an interim, cost-effective solution
and a longer-range, higher-payoff option--promises bigger payoffs in the
future.

<A NAME="chap2-5"><H2>HEAD-MOUNTED DISPLAYS PERMIT HANDS-FREE MAINTENANCE</H2></A>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch2_headup.gif">
PROJECT TITLE: Wearable Computer Systems with Transparent, 
Head-Mounted Displays for Manufacturing, Maintenance, and Training Applications<P>
Hands-free maintenance with lightweight wearable systems will improve worker
productivity.<P>
Other users, such as police offers and surgeons, are expected to create a $100
million annual market for the military to leverage in its effort to reduce
costs.<P>
Some of the most sophisticated equipment in the world is on our battlefield,
but it still fails.  And when it does, repairs--often made by military
personnel under terrible conditions--must be fast and complete. Unfortunately,
repair manuals are too cumbersome for easy reference and are frequently
outdated. Even in a depot where facilities are better, reference books still
hinder the efficiency of maintenance operations.<P>
Computers could solve this problem because they allow users to easily store,
transmit, and modify information. However, to the busy worker, computer
technology has drawbacks because it cannot provide convenient display and
access to information. After all, even the smallest laptop computers available
are no more convenient to a maintenance worker than a book.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
Boeing Computer Services is leading a TRP-funded project to develop new types
of displays--systems that will allow hands-free operation and voice-activated
reference. The team is developing two types: the Augmented Reality System,
which superimposes images on a working surface, and the Multimedia System,
which projects images onto a helmet-mounted face shield. Both systems can be
updated easily.<P>
The displays will soon be tested on the shop floor of McClellan Air Force Base,
the Air Force's biggest logistics center. According to Bill Reedy, who is
managing this effort at McClellan, the Multimedia System will allow mechanics
to instantly view operational instructions, schematics, and technical orders.
It will also allow inspectors to assess the repair requirements of weapons
systems without using the traditional paper checklist, which, Reedy says,
"incurs large delays and losses of information." Reedy also says that the
Augmented Reality System will free workers from the task of "stopping to refer
to old, hard-to-find, and illegible drawings and templates."<P>
The displays will also help military maintenance and training operations by
eliminating the long time lags that now occur when updating printed
instructional materials. Word of this technology's promise has quickly spread,
as the Marines at Camp Pendleton have asked to test one of the prototype
displays developed at Carnegie-Mellon University. In these tests, the display
will contain a technical inspection guide for an amphibious vehicle.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
Of the two displays, the Augmented Reality System features the more complex
technology, since it must project an image on a constantly moving target. To
solve this problem, this display features a position-sensing device that tracks
the user's eye movements and head direction. With this information, the display
unit can project the information through a transparent display and onto the
work surface. Workers having this capability do not have to fumble through
books, so their hands are free to work without interruption.<P>
The Multimedia System features an inexpensive and lightweight head-mounted
display, which is used in situations where information does not need to appear
directly on the work surface. Instead, the display is designed so that the
information is always in the user's field of view, even when his or her head
moves.<P>
<B>Making Technology Affordable Through Commercial Participation</B><P>
Beyond maintenance and manufacturing, the displays could improve the
productivity of police officers, surgeons, and nearly all other workers who
perform complicated tasks with their hands. "The thing about this project,"
says David Mizell, a manager of the project at Boeing, "is that it's so natural
for the TRP." Because there's a large commercial market for head-mounted
displays (Honeywell and Virtual Vision project that the total available market
is well over $100 million per year), the development effort will someday allow
the military to purchase head-mounted displays for much less money than if it
tried to develop this technology on its own.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
Moving toward that mark, Honeywell has already spun off a new company called
Trisen, Inc., to market head-mounted displays to industrial and medical
markets. Honeywell also plans to take technology developed through this
dual-use project and incorporate it into the cockpit displays it makes for
military helicopter pilots.<P>

PROJECT TITLE: TI/Raytheon "Leap Ahead" Approach to U.S. Flat-Panel Display Competitiveness<P>
The military needs responsive suppliers who whill customize commercially
derived technology to produce displays that meet rigorous military
requirements.<P>
The success of these projects will ensure that the military can access
high-performance, low-cost, reliable flat-panel displays critical to future
battlefield operations.<P>
Technological change is undoubtedly making more information available at
ever-increasing speeds. The effective use of this information is no longer
limited by the speed of delivery but by the ability to understand what is
delivered. Anyone who has tried to use a high-powered laptop computer in poor
light knows that all the processing speed in the world is useless if the
information is unreadable. Therefore, it is easy to see why there is so much
interest in developing advanced flat-panel displays.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
Success on future battlefields hinges on the ability to collect, collate,
analyze, and disseminate a torrent of information. As in the commercial world,
flat-panel displays will be the primary means by which the combatant will dip
from this river of data. Therefore, the military needs early access to the
latest generation of display technologies. It also needs responsive suppliers
who will customize commercially derived technology to produce displays that
meet rigorous military requirements. Such displays must operate in both desert
and arctic temperatures and be readable in sunlight as well as in night combat.
In addition, they must offer extremely high resolutions, integrate specialized
information-processing capabilities, and be available in nonstandard sizes--all
at an affordable cost.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
Late in 1994, the TRP selected three projects for negotiation. These efforts
focus on developing low-cost approaches to manufacturing advanced display
technologies. By sharing costs, corporations are ensuring their commitment to
commercializing these displays.<P>
One effort, led by Planar Systems, Inc., will improve efficiency and reduce
power consumption of electroluminescent (EL) displays--the displays that the
military uses most often because of their many advantages. These displays are
inherently rugged, have a wide viewing angle range, and can operate in a wide
range of temperatures. The focus of the effort is to develop both medium-sized
EL displays and miniature high-resolution displays for head-mounted
applications.<P>
Silicon Video Corporation and Texas Instruments are leading the other two
efforts. These activities will develop and demonstrate technology for low-cost
manufacturing of medium-sized and small field-emission displays. The displays
will ultimately be brighter, have a higher power efficiency, and cost less to
manufacture than current displays.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
Although the military has invested heavily in the development of advanced
display technology, it will be only a small fraction of the total production
market--a market that will be driven by commercial computer and entertainment
applications. A handful of foreign firms dominate this market, accounting for
more than 90 percent of global production.  They have already proved unwilling
to work with the military on its specialized requirements.<P>
The growing demand for displays, coupled with innovative technology developed
in the United States over the past few years, affords an opportunity for U.S.
firms--firms that will be responsive to military needs--to succeed in this
rapidly growing commercial market.  Such an opportunity fits perfectly into the
TRP's strategy of leveraging commercial markets for the benefit of Defense.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
Each of the efforts is specifically planning to demonstrate new displays in
military hardware. For example, one of the efforts is planning to demonstrate
active-matrix ELs in head-mounted displays for helicopter pilots. Medium-sized
EL displays are being tested in an Army artillery vehicle. In addition,
field-emission displays are being used in an infrared rifle sight and a cockpit
display (including planned flight testing).<P>
The success of these TRP programs will ensure that the DoD has access to
high-performance, low-cost, reliable flat-panel display technology critical to
future battlefield operations.<P>
<A NAME="chap2-1"><HR></A><H2>SPEECH RECOGNITION FOR HANDHELD COMPUTERS APPROACHES
BATTLEFIELD</H2> 
PROJECT TITLE: Developing Speech Recognition for Future Digital Signal
Processors in Handheld Computers<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In combat, speech recognition would help soldiers synchronize
operations, make better decisions, and act more quickly.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
"The sight of a soldier going to war with a rifle in one hand and a laptop
computer in the other would have been shocking only a few years ago. Yet that
is exactly what was seen in the sands of Saudi Arabia in 1990 and 1991." 1
Speech-enabled palmtop computers will anchor this revolution in the military's
arsenal.<P>
Of all forms of communication, speech is the most fundamental. Talking does not
require special equipment. Historically, the need to record and transmit
information over long distances has spawned all other forms of
communication--from the written word to today's interactive multimedia
programs. A computer speech-recognition system would eliminate the need for the
keyboard, the mouse, the pen-based computer, and all the other input devices;
the user could simply talk.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
The smaller, more portable computers resulting from such an innovation would be
a boon to the military. Possible uses include portable battlefield information
systems, translation systems for multilingual forces, inventory control
systems, data access and query, and command and control. In combat, these
devices would help soldiers synchronize operations, make better decisions, and
act more quickly. And in peacetime, they would make soldiers and commanders
more productive--allowing fewer personnel to do more at a time when Defense
forces are being reduced.<P>
While primitive computer speech-recognition programs exist today, they are
still too slow for natural conversation and require huge amounts of memory to
operate. Speed and memory requirements have limited speech recognition to the
few specialized areas where it is practical to use a very large and very
powerful computer. To overcome these limitations, the TRP is sponsoring a joint
research effort between Dragon Systems, the world leader in personal computer
speech recognition, and Analog Devices, a world leader in signal-processing
products.<P>
In this project, the two companies are developing speech-recognition systems so
practical and affordable that they can be incorporated into all personal
computers, even handheld ones. Because the speech-recognition software will be
scalable to fit the memory available, it will be useful in many areas. For
instance, devices could process large vocabularies for general use or, in
specialized devices, small technical vocabularies.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
To achieve this level of performance, Analog Devices is developing specialized
microprocessors, called digital signal processors, that can take speech
patterns--which have been converted into a digital form--and reduce them to
their most salient information. Dragon Systems, in turn, is developing
algorithms needed to match these digital patterns against stored voice
patterns. To reduce the computational power needed to make these matches, the
algorithms make educated guesses about what was said, taking into account
different accents and dialects, the frequency of use of certain words, grammar,
and semantic associations.<P>
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
Once complete, this system will also meet the demands of many users outside the
military.  For example, speech recognition would allow users to prepare e-mail,
letters, and other written documents on handheld computers, without keyboards.
It will also make home computers easier to use for those who cannot type, or
prefer not to.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
This effort began in May 1994, and so far the team members have begun to
develop the initial digitization algorithms needed to produce these devices. If
successful, this activity will help the United States maintain its global
leadership in speech-recognition technology and feed the growing computer and
telecommunications industries.<P>

Night vision, surveillance, and chemical agent detection--these are just
a few uses for military sensors in which advanced technology can give U.S.
troops a big advantage in battle. While the military has been aware of the
benefits of advanced sensors for years, the commercial sector is just beginning
to see broad uses for civilian purposes. As a result, just when the military
procurements are diminishing for sensor R&amp;D, the commercial market has now
begun to grow rapidly. Through leveraging, the TRP is trying to tap into this
new commercial R&amp;D so that the military can access state-of-the-art sensors
that meet Defense needs at a reduced cost. This strategy will also allow the
military to learn about and apply technological advances that are occurring in
the commercial marketplace and tailor them so that they meet Defense needs.<P>

<A NAME="chap3-1"><HR><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="image/approach.gif"></A><H2>UNCOOLED INFRARED SENSORS</H2>    
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch3_hgear.gif">Infrared (IR) sensors on the
battlefield have revolutionized the military's ability to "own the night," allowing 
soldiers to fight in near-total
darkness. Already, these devices have been used in many military
systems--playing a vital role in the U.S. ground victory in Operation Desert
Storm.<P>
The military, unfortunately, has faced many barriers in making such equipment
available on a large scale. Conventional IR sensors are expensive, in part
because they require cryogenic refrigeration equipment. They cost too much to
be widely distributed to combat troops.<P>
And while uncooled sensors exist today, they are not without problems. For
example, although uncooled sensors cost less than their cryogenic counterparts,
they are still too expensive for widespread military use. They also require
further R&amp;D to improve performance--R&amp;D that IR producers are planning
to reduce or eliminate if demand for these devices does not grow. The potential
commercial market is 10 times the size of the military market.<P>
To address these problems, the TRP is leveraging commercial investments through
three uncooled IR approaches. The TRP's goals are to make these sensors perform
better and be widely available--at less than one-tenth the cost of current
uncooled IR sensors. These activities will accelerate the entry of uncooled IR
technology into the commercial market and contribute to sustain the
manufacturing base needed to make affordable high-performance sensors.<P>

SENSORS</H2>     
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch3_abc.gif">Even in the smallest
conflicts, the very survival of U.S. troops could depend on advanced sensors to 
quickly and remotely detect nuclear, biological,
and chemical (NBC) warfare agents. At home, the military requires similar
equipment to detect the release or presence of toxic substances on military
bases so that it can comply with stringent environmental standards. In both
cases, the military needs systems that are portable, accurate, and remote.  The
systems also must be able to alert personnel of any toxic releases
immediately.<P>
Commercial industries, especially in the manufacturing and petrochemical areas,
have similar problems that can be addressed with the same technologies. Their
need to monitor and report the release of various toxic substances is essential
to operations. Therefore, they also require real-time portable sensors that
detect hazardous agents to monitor toxic spills, smokestack emissions, and
other pollutants.<P>
Because the commercial market for environmental sensors is growing rapidly, it
makes sense for the DoD to join forces with the commercial sector to develop
dual-use sensors. Therefore, the TRP is encouraging commercialization of
sensors for detecting NBC warfare agents, helping the military take advantage
of technological advances and cost reductions from the commercial sector. With
today's diminishing military procurements, many of these sensors would not be
developed further without implementing the TRP's dual-use strategy.<P>

MILITARY TO OWN THE NIGHT-AFFORDABLY</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch3_uncool.gif">PROJECT TITLES: Uncooled
Infrared Microbolometer Sensor Cost Reduction Program<P> Uncooled Infrared Sensors<P>
Uncooled Low-Cost Technology Reinvestment Alliance (ULTRA)<P>
Lower-cost uncooled IR sensors will enable broader use of a technology that has
allowed the military to "own the night," while tapping into the resources of
domestic producers.<P>
The challenges of all these efforts are to reduce the costs and improve the
performance of uncooled IR sensors through production efficiencies and
economies of scale.<P>
Generations of cryogenically cooled infrared (IR) sensors have allowed the U.S.
military to "own the night." In fact, IR sensors contributed to the nation's
ground victory in Operation Desert Storm. But despite their benefits, cooled IR
sensors cannot be widely distributed to combat troops, mostly because they are
too expensive. The military has therefore begun investigating uncooled IR
sensors, which cost much less.<P>
But before uncooled IR sensors can meet military requirements, further
development is needed to improve performance and lower costs even further. As a
result, the TRP is supporting three uncooled IR approaches. The program's goal
is to develop better-performing military IR systems--at one-tenth the cost of
today's systems. These competing approaches will accelerate the entry of
uncooled IR technologies into the commercial market and help sustain the
manufacturing base needed to make low-cost, high-performance military
systems.<P>
<B>Addressing the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</B><P>
If successful, these projects will enhance our troops' ability to fight
under the cover of night and obscurants. Specific areas where uncooled IR
sensors will help the military include missile terminal guidance systems and
incoming warning systems for aircraft. They also can be used in surveillance
systems for reconnaissance and physical security, vehicle lights-out night
driving, and, eventually, infrared goggles for soldiers.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
The challenge of these efforts is to reduce the cost of the system's reflective
optics and simplify the electronic subsystems. Two of the efforts, one led by
Loral Infrared Imaging Systems and the other by Inframetrics, will develop
uncooled IR sensors using a monolithic microbolometer detector. This device is
a sensitive resistance thermometer that can detect and measure thermal
radiation. It is easier to make than other sensors. Because the microbolometer
is deposited on a silicon substrate, it can be made using conventional silicon
processing. It also has a monolithic structure, which simplifies processing.<P>
Using such techniques, developers are able to reduce the number of processing
steps needed to make these sensors while improving the readout integrated
circuit. Ultimately, the teams' approaches will lower fabrication costs while
streamlining the integration process. The efforts will also lead to a more
efficient low-noise system interface.<P>
Texas Instruments is leading a third effort, which will develop uncooled IR
sensors that use barium strontium titanate detectors. The fabrication process
will allow manufacturers to increase the size of the wafers from the
conventional 4 inches to 6 inches, while making the devices 2 to 4 times more
sensitive. While lowering costs, such techniques will allow the detectors to be
manufactured through commercial producers.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
Today's commercial market is about 10 times larger than the military's for
uncooled IR sensors. Therefore, by allowing producers to address the larger
commercial market in their military research, the TRP will encourage further
development. At the same time, the program will ensure that military needs are
considered during this work.<P>
Commercial uses of uncooled IR sensors include detecting heat loss in buildings
and power line leakage; seeing through smoke during fires; monitoring
manufacturing processes; assisting in search-and-rescue activities; and
providing night driving assistance for cars, trucks, ships, and boats. These
applications represent a large and growing market.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
The initial demonstration of the silicon microbolometer uncooled IR sensor is
slated for late summer 1995. The barium strontium titanate IR detector is
expected to be demonstrated within a year.<P>
By supporting development efforts in uncooled IR sensors, the military will
soon be able to buy affordable uncooled IR systems from domestic sources. As
the market grows, the commercial sector will be able to develop improved
sensors entirely on its own. Then the military will simply add its own
requirements to an already active industry.<P>
<A NAME="chap3-5"><HR></A><H2>MILLIMETER-WAVE SENSORS CONQUER
FOG</H2> PROJECT TITLE: Passive Millimeter-Wave Camera <P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch3_fog.gif">Military applications for this
system are virtually unlimited, including guidance systems for aircraft, ships, and land vehicles and air defense
monitors.<P>
These detectors can see through fog, smoke, and dust, without transmitting
signals the enemy can detect. <P>
 While the military can rule the night using infrared sensors, it still
has not conquered fog, smoke, dust, and sandstorms. Imaging capabilities of
infrared cameras are simply blocked by these conditions. And while imaging
radar can penetrate weather-related obscurants (after all, scientific missions
have long used it to map cloud-covered surfaces), it sends out a signal that
the enemy can detect.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
Through a TRP-funded project led by TRW Space and Electronics Group,
researchers are developing a Passive Millimeter-Wave Camera that will solve
this problem. The military applications for such a system are virtually
unlimited. For example, the Navy could use the sensors in poor-visibility
conditions to guide ships through harbors and channels. While the Navy now uses
radar devices on aircraft carriers and ships, the devices are affected by
clutter from other electromagnetic signals when operating in high-traffic
areas. Therefore, sailors often cannot distinguish extraneous signals from
obstacles and approaching ships.<P>
But TRW's main military focus is aircraft sensors. When equipped with a Passive
Millimeter- Wave Camera and other sensors, special operations military aircraft
can take off and land under zero-visibility conditions. These cameras present
tremendous advantages in the safety and scheduling of covert operations. For
example, if bad weather delays an aircraft carrying spare parts, all military
operations depending on those parts can be stopped. TRW's sensors would prevent
such delays.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
Sensors that detect radiation in the millimeter wavelengths (frequencies above
30 gigahertz) have the unique ability to see through fog, clouds, smoke, dust,
and other obscurants without emitting a signal that other sensors can detect.
This effort employs an array of special detectors called millimeter-wave
monolithic integrated circuits; this focal plane array can passively capture
images through low-visibility conditions and instantly project a TV-like image.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
By teaming with McDonnell Douglas, the consortium is also incorporating these
sensors into the commercial airline fleet to prevent delays and cancellations
caused by bad weather. Currently, only aircraft with specialized (and costly)
landing systems can land in bad weather--and, even then, only at the 39
specialized airports with category III landing facilities that match this
capability. Aircraft using TRW's sensors and appropriate flight guidance
controls could land in low-visibility weather at more than 1,200 category I
facilities across the United States.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
This commercialization effort will help Defense. According to Merit Shoucri at
TRW Space and Electronics Group, commercialization "allows us to keep our
foundry going through industry investment in commercial products; for the
government, it avoids nonrecurring engineering--a major cost driver for
military contracts."<P>
According to Shoucri, the TRP has helped increase the cost efficiency and
decision-making capabilities of the consortium members. "It gets industry and
government talking on an equal basis, and money is spent more wisely...When you
have a consortium, everybody is part of the decision. Government gets better
exposure to the process of the R&amp;D, because it is more involved." He also
said that since industry has to contribute more than 50 percent of the cost, it
likewise is concerned with maximum returns and the success of the project.<P>
<A NAME="chap3-6"><HR></A><H2>DIAL SENSORS TO PROTECT SOLDIERS</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch3_dial.gif">PROJECT TITLE:
EcoScan--A Tunable Infrared Laser Remote Sensing System<P> Military personnel can sense whether chemical agents are present in an area
before they enter it.<P>
Industry can use the DIAL-based system to monitor Clean Air Act compliance.<P>
Using small, portable environmental monitors, military personnel will soon be
able to detect deadly airborne chemical and biological agents before they enter
a danger zone. These devices, now being developed under the TRP, are based on a
technology called Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL). DIAL remotely senses
low concentrations of these harmful agents, allowing soldiers to take
appropriate countermeasures to protect themselves.<P>
The TRP is funding the effort to develop this lifesaving technology that
detects chemicals by their signatures in the electromagnetic spectrum. Rockwell
International's Rocketdyne Division is leading this project to develop a
monitor called EcoScan, which operates in the infrared part of the spectrum.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
In addition to battlefield uses, this sensor can reduce the cost of monitoring
military bases for harmful emissions.  It also can help the military develop
realistic countermeasure laser systems.  EcoScan will function day or night and
in any weather.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
DIAL is based on a technology called lidar, short for "light detection and
ranging."  Lidar is similar to conventional radar but uses a different portion
of the electromagnetic spectrum. Once a lidar signal detects a cloud of
particles, DIAL measures the difference in how much light a compound absorbs at
two closely spaced frequencies. This difference reveals the characteristic
spectral signature of the compound. Since the DIAL system's sensors detect many
signatures at once, sophisticated computer algorithms must sort through the
signatures to determine whether hazardous chemicals or biological agents are
present.<P>
Concentrating on the infrared spectrum, the EcoScan system can detect the
spectral signature of most compounds in the world's arsenal of chemical
weapons. At the core of the system is an extremely compact laser whose output
is continuously tunable from 1 to 5 microns in wavelength.<P>
<B>Making Technology Affordable Through Commercial
Participation</B><P>
 Several important pollutants can be measured in the infrared range. For
instance, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur and many industrial chemicals have
infrared spectral signatures. As a result, industries could continuously
monitor for compliance with the Clean Air Act and other environmental
regulations. Such systems should cost less than one-tenth as much as current
monitoring technologies. Because cost is a big issue in making a successful
commercial environmental monitoring product, the military will benefit from
this transfer as the economies of scale in this multimillion-dollar market
drive down costs and as competitive forces encourage more innovation.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
A prototype EcoScan system is now being developed at Rocketdyne; field testing
will demonstrate the ability to detect several chemical species.<P>
<A NAME="chap3-7"><HR><H2>IMAGING SYSTEM MONITORS FOR RADIOACTIVE
MATERIAL</H2></A> <IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch3_gris.gif">PROJECT
TITLE: Gamma Ray Imaging System for Nuclear Environment Monitor<P> Radiation detectors available today cannot produce a two-dimentional map of
emissions.<P>
With this imaging system, military personnel can determine the location, size,
and intensity of radioactive <BR>emissions.<P>
AIL Systems, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Industrial Quality Inc.,
and PMX have teamed together to develop a Gamma Ray Imaging System (GRIS). This
system can be used to detect, locate, and provide two-dimensional mapping of
radioactive materials. It has both military and commercial applications, which
range from prevention of terrorist attacks to power plant monitoring.<P>
Many of the capabilities of GRIS far surpass those of existing systems that
monitor radioactive materials. While current systems (Geiger counters) merely
detect the presence of such materials, the GRIS system allows technicians to
determine the location, amount, and intensity of these sources--information
that is readily displayed on a TV-like monitor. In addition, through a
combination of technologies, GRIS is man portable and affordable ($50,000 to
$75,000 per unit).
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
With GRIS, military personnel can inspect nuclear facilities and monitor
nuclear-powered Navy vessels. GRIS can also be used to detect and locate
nuclear materials indicative of a covert program for developing nuclear
weapons. The monitors therefore could play an important role in treaty
verification operations and in detecting nuclear materials being smuggled into
the United States and other countries.<P>
Additionally, GRIS may serve as a safety tool in both war and peacetime to
avoid hazardous areas contaminated by gamma-ray-emitting materials. On
battlefields and training grounds, the system can help cleanup crews detect
radioactive material, even in areas with low levels of depleted uranium rounds.
It also can be used after terrorist attacks to detect nuclear contamination in
soil, water, or buildings.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
The GRIS unit uses scintillating materials, fiber-optic bundles, and a
charge-coupled device camera to detect radiation. The data gathered with these
technologies are then combined with video camera data to show the location,
size, and intensity of the gamma-ray-emitting isotopes. Development activities
will include the integration of advanced detection and signal-processing
technologies and the design, fabrication, and evaluation of a prototype
detector.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
Utilities, which currently use Geiger counters to detect leaks in their nuclear
power plants, have the most to gain from GRIS. Roughly half of the market share
in this application represents an initial sales estimate of $200 million during
the 1990s, based on an initial market of 7,800 units and a unit price of
$50,000 to $75,000. The devices can also be used to monitor waste from nuclear
medicine.<P>
The TRP project will require 18 months at a total estimated cost of $2.4
million. Only 35 percent of total funding was provided by the government.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
The first commercial unit is expected to be available in September 1995.<P>

 The soldier is the mainstay of a strong and effective military system.
If these defenders are wounded, the nation owes them the best treatment
possible. The TRP is advancing medical technologies that will help these
soldiers survive through the "golden hour"--the first hour after injury, when
so many soldiers die.  Studies show that a large percentage of combat zone
casualties must be diagnosed and treated during this hour, or the chance of
recovery is poor. Unchanged since the Civil War, this low survival rate is
largely due to lack of information and access; it has historically been
difficult to extract diagnostic information and obtain expert medical advice
under battlefield conditions.<P>
Technologies such as "virtual physicians" and streamlined communications for
consultation will ultimately help these soldiers expeditiously receive the best
care, while improving the capabilities of the medics on the far-forward
battlefield. Advanced technology will also help locate, track, and monitor
injured soldiers on the field.<P>
The TRP is committed to enhancing health care for the military and remaining on
the forefront of the electronic revolution in medicine, where new commercial
technologies are fueling many medical advances.  Such state-of-the-art
innovations include filmless radiographic imagery, noninvasive blood analysis,
advanced telemedical communications, and computer-based surgical models. The
TRP participates directly in the development of these important technologies,
thereby ensuring first-rate medical care for combat personnel.<P>

</A><H2>NEW FRONTIERS IN MILITARY MEDICINE</H2><P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch4_xray.gif">The TRP strategy
behind casualty treatment activities is to enhance casualty care by jointly 
developing technologies that can be used by both the
military and the civilian emergency treatment sector. The military can benefit
tremendously by codevelopment of medical technologies that have both
battlefield and civilian uses. For example, since emergency teams and hospitals
will use the technologies nearly every day, the commercial sector will provide
a test base. These groups will continuously refine design specifications,
providing feedback to the production community.  Input about design and system
usage from such a broad base will ultimately allow the military to access
refined and well-tested materials during training and actual conflicts.<P>
In addition, TRP support of critical medical technologies allows the military
to receive state-of-the-art equipment and methodology expeditiously. Where the
private sector is more advanced than the DoD, the TRP can leverage commercial
accomplishments into accessible military capabilities. Where the DoD has the
lead, TRP support can help foster commercial development.<P>
To make these medical advances useful for the unique needs of the military, the
TRP is addressing combat-specific requirements, such as portability, low
probability of detection, and low power consumption. The TRP activities are
also addressing the increasing military dependence on commercial health care
systems. DoD casualty treatment systems must be compatible and interoperable
with such health care systems because, more and more, the military must use
civilian treatment centers, doctors, and other related resources. It is
therefore essential that the military be involved in developing and enhancing
these technologies. In addition, achieving compatibility between commercial and
military technology can also serve as a model for interoperability among the
services. The TRP's proactive approach in military medicine helps coordinate
and identify the special needs of casualty care.<P>

BATTLEFIELD</H2><P> <IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch4_xmachine.gif">PROJECT TITLE:
Digital X-Ray System for Trauma and Battlefield Applications<P> Medics will be able 
to use lightweight filmless x-rays at 
accident sites and in combat, saving time and lives.<P>
The TRP is investigating various approaches to nonfilm x-ray systems. Unlike
those producing x-ray film, nonfilm x-ray systems allow images to be captured,
displayed, stored, and digitally transferred from location to location in real
time. Since the systems are highly mobile, they allow injuries to be diagnosed
on the battlefield--a significant advance in trauma care. The system also
offers economic advantages, reducing image costs to about one-eighth of those
for x-ray film.<P>
General Electric Corporate Research and Development (GE) is basing its approach
on a solid-state x-ray imaging panel using amorphous silicon technology.
Researchers at the company have been developing this technology in their
laboratories for the past 6 years. GE conducted a coordinated, tri-Service
demonstration in May 1995.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
Wounded soldiers often suffer extensive hard tissue injuries, such as broken or
shattered bones, which can be life threatening if not quickly and properly
treated. While radiology is sometimes available, the radiology experts often
are not. Digital x-rays are one answer to this problem. Using these systems,
information can be transmitted to specialists behind the lines (or even back in
the United States), where images can be enhanced, and medics can remotely
consult with doctors and radiologists.<P>
GE's technology offers numerous advantages. For example, the imager uses little
power, and its real-time capability allows images to be displayed immediately.
And since the image is digitized, medical personnel have electronic control
over contrast and brightness and need not take additional x-rays because the
first set was over or underexposed. X-rays taken in the field can also be
stored electronically, saving space. Furthermore, they are easily sent on to
the facility that takes over the care of the wounded soldier.<P>
In addition to trauma care, the amorphous silicon medical imager offers cost
savings to the military as a supplier of health care to active-duty personnel,
their families, and the retiree population. Based on the probable selling price
for the system and a conservative replacement rate, the DoD's cost per shot is
$0.25, while that for x-ray film is about $2.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
The electronic x-ray uses a breakthrough imaging technology based on the
amorphous silicon system that has been developed for several years for
large-area flat-panel displays.  Such displays are presently used in advanced
military systems and are finding widespread use in consumer notebook
computers.<P>
Amorphous silicon is a semiconductor that is unique because it can be deposited
on very large area glass substrates. Amorphous silicon technology currently
enables electronic integrated circuits to be made as large as 10 by 10 inches
(25 by 25 centimeters). Circuits as large as 20 by 20 inches (50 by 50
centimeters) will soon be possible.<P>
The amorphous silicon x-ray imager, like the standard x-ray film cassette, will
employ a phosphor scintillator screen to convert impinging x-rays into visible
light. The core of the system will be a solid-state panel x-ray imager (20 by
20 centimeters) consisting of an array of discrete picture elements (pixels) on
a 200-micron pitch to provide a minimum of 1 million pixels.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
The TRP partnership will ensure that military needs, such as ruggedness and
telemedical compatibility, will be considered and that the military will be an
early recipient of this capability. Solid-state, high-performance digital x-ray
systems will revolutionize both civilian and military medical applications. As
replacements for x-ray film, digital images on amorphous silicon cost
one-eighth as much as conventional x-rays. Savings of up to $1.75 billion a
year could be achieved with this imaging technology.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
GE conducted a coordinated, tri-Service demonstration in May 1995. Research and
development continue in the effort to standardize cassette sizes and mobile
unit designs, as well as to improve the visibility of flat-panel displays.<P>
<A NAME="chap4-3"><HR></A><H2>SURGICAL SIMULATION HELPS SAVE LIVES IN MILITARY TRAUMA
CARE</H2><P>   <IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch4_surg.gif">PROJECT TITLE:
Surgical Simulation for Limb Trauma Management<P> Just as flight simulators dramatically reduced military and commercial aircraft
casualties, surgical simulation will save lives and help preserve quality of
life.<P>
Despite increasing reliance on advanced weapons technologies, the
combat-capable soldier remains the linchpin of military success. Therefore, the
military's goal in caring for wounded personnel is to get fighters back on
their feet as quickly as possible. Procedures to treat trauma on the
battlefield affect more than just a soldier's health--they ultimately affect
military outcomes, as well.<P>
One of the challenges to today's military surgeons is that battle conditions
cause wounds of every conceivable type. Such injuries range from the graze of a
bullet to drastic crush injuries, broken bones, and torn muscle. How these
injuries are treated depends on the ability of the surgeon, who faces such
challenges as locating and repairing bleeding vessels, avoiding nerve damage,
reattaching ligaments, and fortifying shattered bones.<P>
Unfortunately, a surgeon learns by doing and requires extensive career
experience in trauma care to obtain this type of expertise. Therefore, one of
the main ways to train trauma surgeons has been practice on deliberately
wounded laboratory animals. Such experiments are not only distasteful but also
inadequate and imprecise in modeling human anatomy.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
To improve surgical training for trauma care, MusculoGraphics, Inc., is leading
a TRP team effort that will enable military surgeons to learn surgical
procedures on realistic computer models. This approach will not only avoid the
use of laboratory animals, but will also cost less than current techniques. And
it will provide better, more humanlike models that will ultimately improve
surgeons' skills.<P>
Recent developments in computer software have enabled conventional
two-dimensional medical imagery to be converted into detailed three-dimensional
representations of human anatomy. The TRP team is using these developments to
create three-dimensional computer limbs. These realistic anatomical models can
be manipulated to simulate specific wounds and wound treatments, allowing
surgeons-in-training to gain "virtual" experience in a wide range of trauma
scenarios.<P>
Such experience will sharpen the skills of the military surgeon, as well as
propel military medicine into the 21st century. As long as there is conflict in
the world, there will be wounded soldiers to attend to. What better way to
serve their needs than to provide them with state-of-the-art physicians?<P>
Moreover, this same technology can be used for collaborative telemedicine by
transmitting three-dimensional images to experts in other locations. When
connected to telemetry lines, the system can transmit anatomically accurate
images to experts in rear-echelon hospitals, enabling medics to interact with
experienced physicians.
<H3>Intothe 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
The initial strategy is to develop a model for a single type of penetration
wound to the lower leg and extrapolate successful algorithms and software
applications to other anatomical examples. Using magnetic resonance imagery,
photographic data, and volume-rendering software, a preselected injury can be
generated, with which the medical trainee can interact in real time. Static and
dynamic displays of skin, bone, muscles, ligaments, blood vessels, and nerves
of the leg will be represented, allowing realistic surgical procedures to be
performed and their effectiveness assessed.<P>
The geometric data for the anatomical structures will be derived from image
data collected as part of the Visible Human Project, sponsored by the National
Library of Medicine. This information is based on computerized tomography,
magnetic resonance imaging, and photographic data. Software is to be based on
industry standards and will use the C programming language and OpenGL graphics
on Silicon Graphics workstations.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
The simulation-based training system will be based on technologies that
MusculoGraphics and others have already developed. The TRP effort ensures that
commercial producers develop these systems with military needs in mind,
addressing the types of injuries, such as shrapnel wounds, found frequently on
the battlefield but rarely in civilian life.<P>
In addition to medical training programs, these technologies are certain to
enhance civilian health areas such as civilian disaster response, emergency
room medicine, and commercial telemedicine. As such, they will provide a ready
market for cost-effective software and hardware packages. These systems can
also be used for the commercial development of minimally invasive surgical
techniques, which are now of great interest to the professional community.
Computer design and analysis of entirely novel surgical techniques can also be
accomplished.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
All aspects and applications of surgical simulation are currently under
development. Successful completion of a static and dynamic representation of
the lower leg will allow other anatomical sites to be modeled in detail, which
will greatly expand the range of simulated surgical procedures.<P>
<A NAME="chap4-4"><HR></A><H2>NON-INVASIVE MONITOR ELIMINATES NEEDLES FOR BLOOD
SAMPLING</H2>
 <IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch4_blood.gif">PROJECT TITLE: System
for Noninvasive Arterial Blood Gas Measurement<P> Noninvasive techniques for 
monitoring critical blood gases will rapidly provide
vital information with reduced risk of infection.<P>
The TRP is leveraging this effort to apply fast-developing technology to combat
medicine needs.<P>
Soldiers with trauma injuries on the battlefield frequently show symptoms of
shock, which can quickly lead to respiratory distress and other
life-threatening conditions. But while diagnosing shock is crucial, it is still
very difficult using conventional procedures. To make such a diagnosis, medics
must determine blood gas values--values that currently must be obtained by
drawing blood from the soldier's artery.<P>
This painful, difficult, and potentially infectious procedure takes time, as
well as a laboratory, to give results. If the patient is already in shock, it
is almost impossible to draw blood from a vessel, because the vessel typically
is working under reduced pressure. On the battlefield, obtaining such values
becomes even more daunting and many times more critical. The field medic must
make rapid triage decisions that hinge on such diagnostic procedures.<P>
Providing a promising new breakthrough for combat and critical care, the TRP is
now funding an effort to provide a noninvasive way to continuously monitor
blood gases. This monitor, developed by Rio Grande Medical Technologies, will
eliminate the need to draw blood from patients, reducing time, cost, and
medical waste. And most important, it reduces the chance of infection by
blood-borne pathogens.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
On the battlefield, noninvasive monitors represent a major innovation in
patient care. Their electronic format allows easy integration of information
into wireless command and control systems so that soldiers can be quickly
evaluated on the field and then tracked and monitored during all phases of
care--from field to hospital.<P>
Noninvasive blood sampling allows accurate determination of critical blood gas
parameters in less time, with less discomfort, and with less risk of infection
than current blood tests.  Since the monitor can provide continuous analysis
without repeated blood drawing, medics will be able to constantly monitor
trends in a soldier's condition, which can change rapidly in acute situations.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
Blood gas parameters such as oxygen, bicarbonate ion, glucose, and alcohol can
be analyzed by passing a near-infrared beam through human tissue and analyzing
the spectral components of light that strike a photodetector. Computer
algorithms originally developed for nondestructive sensing and space-based
imaging are used to perform a multivariate analysis of the light beam's
spectral components.<P>
<H3>Making Technology Affordable Through Commercial
Participation</H3>
 Modern medicine stresses self-care as a way to supplement physician care
and encourage patient responsibility. As an outstanding example, the demand for
a noninvasive, in-home, blood glucose monitor is overwhelming in the diabetic
community, which encompasses 14 million Americans and an $800 million market
for self-testing kits. For combat care and emergency medicine, however, blood
gas monitors have a limited market and are therefore not subject to the market
pull of the diabetic community. The TRP's involvement in developing blood gas
monitors ensures that specific military needs, such as ruggedness and field
portability, will be considered.<P>
The TRP taps into an ongoing effort to develop noninvasive blood chemistry
sensors aimed at both professionals and patients. Fast results and reduced risk
of infection translate into cost savings and better medical outcomes for
soldiers and citizens. Noninvasive blood monitors could benefit military combat
arenas, civilian critical care facilities, and emergency medical situations.
This technology also holds great potential for use in blood alcohol
determination for enforcement of laws prohibiting driving while intoxicated.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
Rio Grande Medical Technologies was founded expressly to develop and
commercialize noninvasive blood chemistry monitors for home and professional
use. The TRP is leveraging this effort to apply fast-developing technology to
combat medicine needs.<P>
<A NAME="chap4-5"><HR></A><H2>INFORMATION MANAGEMENT EASES MEDICAL COORDINATION
TASKS</H2><P> <IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch4_wounded.gif">PROJECT TITLE:
Trauma Care Information Management System<P> Advanced data management systems give the edge to military communications
networks.<P>
Military and civilian health care professionals will benefit from
well-constructed information management systems.<P>
Because injuries are part of every military conflict, the DoD is at the
forefront of advances in battlefield medicine. Part of this challenge is to be
able to quickly and aggressively treat trauma victims within the first hour
after they are injured on the battlefield ("the golden hour").<P>
New advances in combat and casualty care could address this challenge, reducing
battlefield deaths by as much as 40 percent and lowering the number of
disabilities caused by battlefield injuries. But to make this mission
successful, the military needs advanced information technology so that the
medics in the field can immediately obtain a diagnosis--and instructions--from
specialized physicians, who are sometimes thousands of miles away.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
Advanced technologies such as digital x-ray equipment and biomedical sensors
can quickly provide data that can save a soldier's life.  But such advances
also add a flood of information that must be integrated so that medics can make
important decisions, such as which soldier to treat first and which soldier to
evacuate.<P>
Recognizing the need to integrate information and communications for combat
trauma care, the TRP is funding the Trauma Care Information Management System
(TCIMS) Consortium.   TCIMS is a sophisticated system that can coordinate
command decisions, triage, and evaluation plans and then respond to rapidly
changing conditions in the forward field of battle. Through integrated lines of
two-way communication, the system is expected to help medical personnel make
decisions in battlefield trauma care. It also will expedite the flow of
information and processing of patients.<P>
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Innovative Technology</H3><P>
The TCIMS Consortium integrates leaders in medicine, informatics, data
processing, and systems management to construct a state-of-the-art trauma care
system. The system provides the wide bandwidth required to accommodate both
data volume and speed and uses advanced techniques to develop an information
architecture from detailed military and civilian trauma scenarios. This
architecture leverages component technologies that other ARPA programs have
developed in Human-Computer Interactions, Intelligent Integration of
Information, Planning Initiative, and Domain-Specific Systems Architecture. It
is generalized to promote interchangeable "plug-and-play" hardware and software
components for both combat casualties and civilian trauma.<P>
The information architecture tool provides an evolvable specification for
effortless information flow in a network that includes physicians, tactical
commanders or trauma center coordinators, and the medic in the field. A key
feature of the system is that medics can inform receiving hospitals about the
status of incoming casualties; this feature allows surgical teams to allocate
personnel and resources.<P>
In addition, the system can maximize the usefulness of personnel status
monitors, which record and relay heart rate and blood pressure, allowing
medical technicians to make better triage decisions. In TCIMS, vital signs for
these devices can be electronically relayed through a global position system
(GPS) to remote sites such as a hospital or command center. In addition to
monitoring, GPS technology ensures that injured personnel can be located and
tracked. The system also allows instantaneous access to medical libraries and
patient records, managed by advanced database programs and displayed on flat
panels.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
The improved coordination of TCIMS can benefit both the military and the
commercial sector, whether for treating soldiers in a combat zone or victims in
an automobile accident.  It not only enhances decision making but, with high
efficiencies, also reduces medical costs and patient recovery times in both
sectors.<P>
Because TCIMS is designed to adapt and respond to innovations in hardware and
software, it can be tailored to many uses; for example, it can be used for
implementing competent treatments, keeping records, tracking patients between
institutions, generating statistics, and monitoring clinical trials.<P>
In addition, separate components used in TCIMS--now aggressively pursued in the
commercial sector--represent significant civilian markets. For example,
database management is an ever-widening application in business and education,
and information display is similarly poised, with additional interest from the
entertainment industry. In addition, with at least two major partnerships as
well as innumerable small communications concerns, the commercial sector is
already rapidly developing GPS. The economies of scale that result from this
expansion--already evident--will be a boon to military consumers.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
To demonstrate the utility of the system, TCIMS was successfully used during
military medical training exercises in February 1995 (Army) and April 1995
(Navy); a civilian urban scenario is scheduled for November 1995.<P>

<HR>
The global market has created a demand for electronic components and
subsystems that are generally more advanced and less expensive than those used
in Defense products. Yet, as crucial as electronics are to Defense, the
military's market is rapidly dwindling as the commercial market grows. For
example, the military annually buys more than a billion dollars' worth of
integrated circuits, but this represents a small fraction of the total
market--a small share that continues to drop.  The decline gives the military
less influence over the production of electronics that meet Defense
specifications. To remedy this problem, the TRP is leveraging the commercial
electronics market to obtain affordable leading-edge technology for military
missions. It is cofunding industrial development efforts that can serve both
the military and commercial sectors.<P>
<HR><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="image/approach.gif">
<H2>ACCESSING LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY FOR ELECTRONICS DESIGN AND
MANUFACTURING</H2>    

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch5_chip.gif">Although the
military relies heavily on advanced electronics, it can no longer count on the 
Defense industry to produce leading-edge technology. The
TRP recognizes that for our military to maintain its superiority, it must
become a smart customer; otherwise it will not be able to influence its
suppliers to meet Defense-specific needs. Without this influence, the military
will be left behind as, for example, commercial chip makers produce new
innovations. The TRP's approach is allowing military electronics to benefit
directly from advances in commercial packaging technology, such as multichip
modules (MCMs), affordable electronics packaging, Power Electronic Building
Blocks (PEBBs), and optoelectronic devices.<P>
For example, MCM technology represents the next step forward in miniaturizing
electronic components. By this technique, dozens of bare silicon chips can be
interconnected in a single package--often no larger than current packages for
single complex integrated circuits.  But the technology is expensive in limited
production and has some perceived risks. The TRP is focusing on solving these
problems to accelerate widespread use of MCMs in both the military and
commercial sectors.<P>
The TRP is also leveraging commercial technology to lower the cost of
electronics packaging. Essential for a competitive industry and strong national
defense, packaging is central to all electronic systems. For high-end systems,
such as supercomputers and digital signal processors, packaging is key to
system performance; for compact, portable electronics, it affects size and
weight; and, for almost all electronic systems, it leads to improved
reliability. The TRP efforts concentrate on high-volume, cost-sensitive uses,
such as personal information systems, vehicle engine controls, and handheld
electronics. If developed with military needs in mind, new packaging
technologies can give electronics the size, ruggedness, environmental
stability, and special functions needed for military missions at a fraction of
the current cost.<P>
In addition, the TRP is capitalizing on commercial needs for low-cost
electronics design and manufacturing to ensure they can be used for low-volume
electronics required for Defense. For example, activities are being undertaken
in circuit-board-sized PEBBs, power control devices designed to modify, switch,
and otherwise handle heavy-duty currents. PEBBs will revolutionize the way that
military ships, as well as aircraft and other vehicles, are designed through
the expanded use of electronic power control. Finally, new techniques to
package optoelectronic components into compact, efficient modules will lead to
important military contributions. The TRP is interested in these techniques and
others that lower the cost of these processes.<P>

POWER SYSTEMS</H2></A>  
PROJECT TITLE: Power Electronic Building Blocks for Affordable High Performance of 
Electric Power
<P>
The military can use Power Electronic Building Blocks in applications ranging
from more electric aircraft to extremely high-power devices in ships and
submarines.
<P>
Power Electronic Building Blocks will improve the affordability, survivability,
and mission reliability of military systems through expanded use of electronic
power.
<P>
The Electric Power Research Institute and Harris Corporation are engaged in a
TRP-funded project that will allow the United States to once again dominate the
vast markets for power electronics. The world market for these devices alone is
estimated to be $3 billion; additional markets that incorporate such systems
are roughly $330 billion.
<P>
The team's innovation is a highly efficient, lightweight device called the
Power Electronic Building Block (PEBB). Extending power electronic devices into
new performance regimes, this device can be used in virtually every sector,
including the military, utility, and commercial arenas.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
In military applications, PEBBs will make the power systems of tanks,
airplanes, and ships perform better while reducing their cost and improving
survivability. For example, electric filters and other power-conditioning
equipment account for as much as three-quarters of the weight and two-thirds of
the size of the electric power systems in Navy ships. This equipment can also
be quite expensive. The power supplies on DDG-51 and CG-47 Navy ships cost more
than $1.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively.<P>
Using PEBB devices rather than current technology would reduce the cost of
power supplies to $35,000 for the DDG-51 and $72,000 for the CG-47 (about
one-fiftieth that of current systems). PEBBs would also allow the power systems
to be about one-tenth the size of those using conventional technology.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
PEBBs are a concept for intelligent power modules in a scalable bus-controlled
architecture. They will be a fairly small family of standard, solid-state,
programmable, sensor-driven modular blocks that can be packed together to work
as switches, transformers, circuit breakers, filters, or frequency
converters.<P>
New semiconductor power electronic devices based on silicon can already handle
large currents and voltages efficiently. But PEBBs can operate with currents
and voltages an order of magnitude higher. Along with breakthroughs in magnetic
materials and structures, capacitors, cooling and packaging materials, and
manufacturing technology, they offer a potential for revolutionary change in
power electronics.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
About 40 percent of the electricity that utilities generate in the United
States passes through a power electronic converter, controller, or conditioner
to make supply characteristics conform with load requirements. Using PEBBs,
these utilities could save as much as $8.75 billion through higher efficiencies
in switching, benefiting from the extended power-handling capacity of these
devices. Moreover, in commercial and industrial markets, PEBBs will give
equipment suppliers a clear cost advantage for products as diverse as lasers,
robots, motor drives, power supplies, appliances, heating and air conditioning
systems, and electric vehicles. The military will obtain a cost advantage
through leveraging the large commercial market.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
In the next decade, PEBBs will become as important to our nation's electric
power industry as the transistor has been to the electronics industry. They are
being developed to respond to the DoD's critical need for affordable approaches
to controlling electric power in military vehicles and equipment.<P>

<HR><A NAME="chap5-1"><H2>HYBRID CHIPS IMPROVE FIBER-OPTIC GYROSCOPES FOR
MUNITIONS</H2></A> <IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch5_stamp.gif">PROJECT
TITLE: Integrated Optoelectronic Modules<P> IOEMs will reduce the size and cost of fiber-optic gyroscopes for small
munitions while improving their accuracy.<P>
By joining with commercial industry to develop better packaging technology, the
TRP effort will make it cheaper and easier for the military to access this
technology.<P>
Through the TRP, AlliedSignal, Inc., and AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories are working
together to develop a new manufacturing technology that combines optical and
electronic components on a single chip. This chip, called the Integrated
Optoelectronic Module (IOEM) will be applied to a number of militarily critical
areas, such as navigational aids, electronic transmission systems, and
munitions guidance systems based on fiber-optic gyroscopes.<P>
Gyroscopes using fiber-optic and electronic components can make small
munitions--like artillery shells, bombs, and rockets--more accurate. But
current gyroscopes are too bulky to fit on small munitions, and they cost too
much to be widely used. The IOEM is a cost-effective way to merge optical and
electronic components into one compact device.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
IOEMs will see a variety of applications including fiber-optic gyroscopes,
aircraft navigation systems, and navigational aids for small combat units and
individual soldiers on the battlefield. Electronic transmission systems using
IOEMs may also reduce friendly-fire casualties. Fiber-optic gyroscopes help
these munitions stay on course, continuously updating a projectile's navigation
system with position information. Because these gyroscopes vastly improve the
aim of large munitions, they may also increase the accuracy of smaller
munitions in the U.S. arsenal. With IOEMs, fiber-optic gyroscopes can be
miniaturized to create a new generation of small munitions that are smart yet
inexpensive.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
IOEMs combine optical technology with electronic circuitry to transform
electricity to light and back again. By taking advantage of these properties,
optoelectronic circuits can enhance the performance of electronic devices now
limited by heat buildup and interconnection bottlenecks.<P>
IOEMs also may help the telecommunications industry expand its use of
fiber-optic communications, including links to small businesses and homes.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
IOEM technology should provide substantial benefits for military and
telecommunications providers alike. By joining with commercial industry to
develop better packaging technology, the effort should make it cheaper and
easier for the military to access this technology. IOEM technology should also
help the telecommunications industry stimulate the growth of fiber-optic
communications, which has been slowed by the high cost of optoelectronic
components. It may be used to link small businesses and homes to the
information superhighway, improve navigation systems in automobiles, and create
lightning-fast optical computer networks for offices. Such innovations will
also make IOEMs much cheaper and more accessible for Defense.<P>
Bell Labs is enhancing its existing optoelectronic module technology,
integrating AlliedSignal-designed electronic components with AT&amp;T photonic
devices to make new optoelectronic packages. AlliedSignal will integrate IOEM
technology into its fiber-optic gyroscope products used in navigation systems
for military munitions and aircraft. Using IOEMs will lower the cost of
gyroscopes. Also, because the gyroscopes contain no moving parts, they will
last many times longer than existing navigation aids. Bell Labs will also
develop low-cost fiber-optic components such as the IOEM transceiver for
improving fiber-optic communications.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
The TRP team has completed much of the preliminary electronic design work and
has built a few optical circuit subassemblies. It expects to produce IOEM
prototypes by late 1996. The success of this program will ensure that the DoD
can purchase tiny, inexpensive position-locating devices for various military
equipment.<P>
<HR><A NAME="chap5-2"><H2>LOWER-COST MULTICHIP MODULES INCREASE THE SPEED OF
ELECTRONIC DEVICES</H2></A>   
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch5_chip2.gif">PROJECT TITLE: The
MCM Consortium--The Path to a Globally  Competitive MCM Industry in the United States<P>
By lowering the manufacturing cost of MCM devices, the effort should reduce the
cost of electronic components for the military.<P>
Whether in the military or the commercial sector, the big bottleneck in the
speed of electronics is not caused by individual chips themselves but by the
wire connections between these chips. Generally, the shorter the wires between
integrated circuits, the faster a signal will be received.<P>
One way to reduce the length of these wires is to attach bare semiconductor
chips right onto the common carrier, called a multichip module (MCM). This
packaging approach offers the best of both worlds, improving processor
performance and reliability while reducing size and weight.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
To maintain technological superiority, the military needs faster, smaller,
lighter-weight, and better-performing electronics--all at an affordable cost.
To address these needs, the TRP is funding a team called the MCM-D Consortium
to make MCM technology available to the military at a relatively low cost. MCMs
will increase the processing speed of electronics while also enabling
electronic circuit boards to be miniaturized; they therefore can enhance the
performance of many military systems.<P>
For example, MCMs may increase the power and accuracy of weapons carried by
rapid deployment forces, which must have compact, lightweight, versatile
equipment. They also can make acquisition radars faster and more accurate and
make communications equipment less sensitive to electronic interference. In
addition, MCMs will allow the military to use more sophisticated encryption.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
The MCM technology addressed in the TRP is called Multichip Module-Deposited
(MCM-D). It has the highest performance of any type of MCM and enables multiple
unpackaged chips to be interconnected on a single substrate containing a
multilevel thin-film conducting network.<P>
Limited by availability and perceived risks, MCM-D technology has been too
costly for widespread use. Many of its limitations stem from lack of
appropriate production facilities.  MCM-Ds are made by depositing multilayer
thin films onto a substrate using equipment and processes originally designed
for fabricating integrated circuits. The manufacturing tools available to the
MCM foundries are integrated circuit foundry castoffs--tools that have many
limitations and hinder the MCM producers in moving to large-area processing.<P>
Therefore, five major producers of MCM-Ds have joined forces in the MCM-D
Consortium to replace current-generation production facilities. In an effort to
reduce manufacturing cost and risk by an order of magnitude, the consortium
will be developing new, large-format equipment designed specifically to make
MCM-D packages on larger substrates.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
The additional processing capability of MCMs--in smaller, lighter, more
affordable packages--will dramatically affect the commercial electronics
industry. Consumer and commercial electronic equipment will offer more features
and faster processing at reduced prices. By 2000, the U.S. market for these
devices is projected to be $30 billion to $40 billion.<P>
The MCM-D Consortium was formed to coordinate development of a low-cost,
thin-film MCM manufacturing capability in the United States. The objective of
the consortium is to develop and demonstrate large-format, high-volume
production equipment, materials, and processes to manufacture, assemble, and
test thin-film MCMs.<P>
Primarily, the consortium's tasks are to define a strategy that successfully
establishes a viable domestic source of MCM equipment and materials suppliers
and to select a format size that significantly advances manufacturing
productivity (over current state-of-the-art technology). It is also funding the
development and application of large-format equipment as well as other critical
enabling technologies and is demonstrating a proof of concept with equipment,
materials, and processes in a manufacturing process line.<P>
There are five member foundries in the consortium: Boeing, Hughes, MicroModule
Systems, nChip, and Texas Instruments. The Electronic Industries Foundation and
Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International are also participating.
Equipment vendors, materials suppliers, and universities are being invited to
participate in the development and demonstration phase.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
The MCM-D Consortium will establish the foundation for a healthy MCM industry
that can cost-effectively manufacture high-performance MCMs.<P>

Mechanical systems and materials are vital to virtually all major systems, both
in the Defense arena and commercially. How these systems are produced and what
materials are used affects their performance, ultimately dictating their
lifetimes, operating costs, and maintenance requirements.<P>
The TRP is sponsoring several activities to develop enabling technologies that
are the bedrock of modern manufacturing capabilities for Defense. The program's
approach is to build on emerging commercial technologies where applicable and
initiate new commercial markets for Defense technologies. In especially
critical areas, such as composite materials, the TRP is funding innovative
science and technology efforts for Defense-related materials that will benefit
both military and commercial sectors far into the 21st century. By leveraging
commercial activities and markets in areas critical to the DoD, the TRP's
efforts will ensure that key technologies are both available and affordable to
the military.<P>
<HR><img src="image/approach.gif"></A><H2>MECHANICAL DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING</H2><P> 
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch6_mech.gif">Historically, the DoD has driven the development of complex mechanical
devices. Many of these systems, such as the B-2 bomber, are composed of parts
that several different companies manufacture and must eventually integrate into
one system. By improving mechanical designs and their processes, parts and
subsystems can be integrated more efficiently, more easily, and at a lower
cost. Systems with optimized designs and processes will likewise perform
better, require less maintenance, and last longer.<P>
To improve the military's mechanical design capabilities, the TRP is funding
several programs to enhance positioning, cutting, and machining technologies.
For instance, precision cutting, based originally on Defense-developed lasers,
can double the lives of some engine parts because it is extremely accurate and
provides clean surfaces. This technology can be transferred directly to the
commercial aircraft market. Precision machining technology improves the
military's capabilities to manufacture other systems for the battlefield, such
as optical guidance systems, infrared countermeasures for missiles, and remote
monitors for chemical and biological agents. This technology is expected to
save more than $10 million per airframe.<P>
Further into the future, the TRP plans to develop and demonstrate new,
affordable, advanced digital electronics and control technologies. For example,
such developments can help control fuel flow to engines in military aircraft,
thereby significantly lowering operating costs. <P>
Mechanical design and manufacturing technologies will enable more efficient and
cost-effective manufacturing techniques and more reliable products, which
include computer intelligence and precision positioning to reduce manufacturing
costs and enhance operating performance in Defense products.<P>

<H2>MATERIALS AND STRUCTURE MANUFACTURING</H2><P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch6_engine.gif">Defense's reduced
demand for advanced materials and structural systems, without some compensating growth in civilian demand, threatens the existence of
the U.S. advanced materials industries as they apply to the military. Through
several activities, the TRP is addressing this shortfall to ensure that
advanced materials are available for essential Defense uses, such as
high-performance aircraft and bridging equipment.<P>
If advanced materials for the military can be put to civilian use, then the
military will always be able to access these materials through commercial
producers. Dual-use enhancements in this area include product-oriented
computation and modeling, affordable processing and manufacturing, and the
replacement of standard materials with advanced materials. Such advancements
benefit both sectors by improving the performance of systems such as aircraft
or by reducing their cost.<P>
Joining forces with several aircraft manufacturers and vendors, the TRP is
focusing on low-cost, reliable manufacturing approaches for composite materials
used in propulsion systems. These new materials may significantly improve the
performance of military aircraft while making them stronger and more durable.
But for this potential to be realized, the commercial market for such materials
must grow so that the much smaller Defense market can access a reliable source
of advanced materials as needed.<P>
The TRP is also focusing on processes for maintaining equipment. One process,
popularly called Just-in-Time Maintenance, is a software-based system that
analyzes when equipment must be repaired. Information is gathered from
equipment itself, and neural network software analyzes the copious data to find
patterns and anomalies that show early signs of failing parts. Therefore, the
machine is removed from service only when parts must be replaced.<P>

PROCESSES</H2></A>
 
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch6_prelaser.gif">PROJECT TITLE:
Precision Laser Machining
<P> 
The Precision Laser Machining project has already demonstrated unprecedented
laser cutting of graphite epoxy composites for military airframes with minimal
charring and delamination.
<P>
More precise and faster than alternatives, Precision Laser Machining may
improve the manufacturing process for military and commercial aircraft,
engines, and ships--as well as for automobiles.<P>
In a team called the Precision Laser Machining (PLM) Consortium, Defense and
commercial firms are introducing Defense-developed lasers to technicians on
machine shop floors and in manufacturing plants across the nation. PLM
techniques are a faster and more accurate alternative to traditional processes.
And as such, they can strengthen the capabilities of many U.S. manufacturers
while allowing the nation's laser machine tool businesses to compete more
aggressively in the international arena.<P>
These tools will directly benefit the military in many ways. For example, they
will increase the life and fuel efficiency of military aircraft and reduce
associated life-cycle costs of engine fleets.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
Lasers and electro-optics, now more critical than ever, have provided the
nation with essential capabilities for force projection. The TRP's activities
in PLM enhance these laser and optical capabilities in the military and
commercial manufacturing industry so that affordable laser-based and optical
systems can be used directly on the battlefield.<P>
But the PLM project is also attacking specific manufacturing problems to
benefit current and future military systems. For example, in airborne
applications, the team is developing new tools and processes to extend the life
of engine components and improve aircraft fuel efficiency.<P>
Using highly precise laser beams with variable pulse formats, manufacturers of
aircraft engines will be able to drill holes more precisely and more
reproducibly. Such techniques could lower the life-cycle costs of an engine
fleet by $100 million when used to manufacture platforms like the F-119 engine
on the F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter. And because these systems produce less
charring when cutting graphite-epoxy composites, the military could save more
than $10 million per airframe platform for systems such as the Comanche
helicopter and the V-22 Osprey.<P>
Defense can also benefit from added fuel efficiencies obtained through PLM.
Manufacturers using PLM can increase the fuel efficiency of military aircraft
by several percent by drilling millions of highly uniform microscopic holes in
airfoils, to reduce wind drag.  In addition, PLM could double the life of
military aircraft engines. With this technology, aircraft engines can operate
20 degrees cooler since manufacturers can more precisely drill cooling channels
in the aircraft engine turbine blades made from superalloys.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
Lasers are highly focused beams of light that can quickly deliver lots of
energy to a tiny, often inaccessible area with little or no damage to
surrounding areas. They have been effectively used in manufacturing
applications such as high-speed welding of sheet metal for ships and
automobiles, drilling of cooling channels in aircraft engines, and precision
cutting of composites for lightweight airframes. However, most laser machine
tools today use either carbon dioxide gas lasers or lamp-pumped solid-state
lasers, both of which have major limitations. The PLM Consortium will develop a
new class of high-speed, high-precision laser machine tools using diode-pumped
solid-state lasers.<P>
The diode-pumped laser technology used in PLM will be able to deliver brighter,
high-quality laser beams that can target a work surface spot 5 to 10 times
smaller, with an energy density 25 to 100 times greater than current lasers. It
also has a higher peak power (25 megawatts versus the current 50 kilowatts) and
higher average power (6 kilowatts versus the current 3 kilowatts for
lamp-pumped solid-state lasers). Its packaging is much smaller than that of
current lasers (20 to 40 cubic feet versus 70 to 150 cubic feet). In addition,
it requires less maintenance, with intervals of 10,000 to 20,000 hours rather
than 500 to 1,000 hours for previous laser systems.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
A robust laser and optical capability in the military and commercial
manufacturing industry will lead to affordable laser-based systems and optical
systems for the military. They offer a broad range of Defense and commercial
products, since they can cut and drill holes faster, deeper, and more
accurately than other types of systems. They also will be able to cut and shape
a wider variety of composite materials, weld aluminum and other materials that
dissipate heat quickly, and reduce the size of the heat-affected zone.<P>
In addition to military applications previously mentioned, PLM technology has a
wide variety of possible civilian uses. For example, PLM lasers delivered
through fiber optics will allow manufacturers to weld very large structures.
They therefore can be used for deep-penetration welding of double-hulled panels
for commercial and military ships.<P>
In addition, if used extensively, next-generation lasers to weld automobile
bodies could save $185 per car in materials and time; they could also reduce
the weight of each vehicle by 45 pounds, increasing fuel efficiency.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
The objective of this project is to develop PLM tools for drilling, cutting,
welding, and heat-treating a variety of mechanical and composite parts on
manufacturing assembly lines.  PLM will enable higher precision and greater
tooling speeds than are currently available. In addition, it will improve the
manufacturing process to machine and join advanced high-strength metals and
composite materials at precise tolerances at a cost lower than that of
conventional methods. As a result, the most advanced and affordable U.S.
military systems will be made available, including aerospace platforms and
propulsion systems, heavy equipment, and shipbuilding. <P>

<A NAME="chap6-2"><H2>JUST-IN-TIME MAINTENANCE PREVENTS EQUIPMENT FAILURES WITH
REDUCED DOWNTIME</H2></A>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch6_jit.gif">PROJECT TITLE:
Just-in-Time Maintenance<P> This $700,000 TRP investment will prevent catastrophic failures for equipment,
increasing its lifetime and lowering its maintenance costs.<P>
Every large piece of rotating machinery in the military would receive a cost
benefit by using just-in-time maintenance, when fully developed.<P>
Accounting for 10 to 14 percent of costs for manufacturing production,
maintenance represents one of the highest controllable operational expenses.
One reason maintenance is so expensive is generalized maintenance schedules.
While equipment manufacturers base maintenance schedules on valid test data,
such schedules still do not recognize that no two machines are alike.<P>
Therefore, operators observing these recommendations sometimes shut down their
machines for maintenance too early. And likewise, they continue to operate
other machines that actually may require a complete overhaul--all according to
the maintenance schedule.  Systems operators could save both dollars and time,
and increase production, if they knew when their equipment actually needed to
be maintained.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
The military is familiar with maintenance problems, since it has millions of
mechanical systems that must be routinely maintained and repaired. Optimizing
such requirements could greatly reduce costs for Defense, while ensuring that
the military's essential equipment lasts longer and operates properly.<P>
Therefore, the TRP has funded a project on Just-in-Time Maintenance (JITM).
JITM forecasts parts failure, particularly failures from cyclic load damage. It
provides a more precise schedule than current methods, able to pinpoint the
optimum time for maintaining a particular piece of machinery. Bringing down
machines for maintenance only as needed will increase the mean time between
scheduled maintenance while avoiding catastrophic failures.<P>
Led by Northrop-Grumman, this project focuses on increasing the lifetime and
reducing maintenance costs for military helicopters. But once development is
complete, its applications could far surpass those of military helicopters,
potentially benefiting every large piece of Defense-related rotating machinery.
And if applied widely, JITM may save millions of dollars in maintenance costs
while preventing catastrophic failures that waste hundreds of millions of
dollars--and sometimes even lives.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
The team is building a prototype system that uses "fuzzy" logic and advanced
neural networks to instantly detect and classify faults in rotating machinery.
JITM can be implemented in many applications ranging from all-software
diagnostic centers to custom-embedded very large scale integration (VLSI) chips
connected to diagnostic messaging networks. The system's sensors deliver
messages, and the neural networks "learn" from them, knowing when each piece of
equipment is exhibiting anomalies well before any symptoms of failure are
visible. The neural networks then inform the diagnostic messaging network.
Fuzzy logic software enables the computer to determine the best maintenance
schedules for each piece of equipment.<P>
The software resulting from this effort could lead to multimillion-dollar
savings, estimated at $45 million for vibration analysis alone.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
With numerous immediate commercial and military uses, JITM can be used on any
large equipment with turbine engines, pumps, drills, or screws. For example, it
could be used for the propulsion systems of well drillers' ships. It could also
be used for large water or lubricating system pumps.<P>
The U.S. market for the JITM system is estimated at $293 million in 1993 and is
expected to grow about 8 percent annually. Paying half the $1.4 million costs
for the 24-month program, Northrop-Grumman will eventually license the
commercial applications to other companies for incorporation into Defense and
commercial uses.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
The $700,000 TRP investment is already paying dividends. Northrop-Grumman is
developing its potential as a diversified corporation with commercial as well
as military products and services. A prototype system to detect faults in
rotating machinery before failure has been built in a cooperative venture among
Northrop-Grumman, the Long Island Lighting Company, and Texas A&amp;M
University.

PROJECT TITLE: Affordable Composites for Propulsion
<P> 
By
introducing composite materials into ultrahigh-bypass engines, this TRP-funded project will allow the DoD and commercial airlines to obtain
fuel-efficient, lightweight propulsion systems.
<P>
Increased use of composite products will stabilize the U.S. composites industry
and ensure that the DoD can access an affordable supplier base.<P>
Over the past two decades, the promise of improved aircraft performance through
the use of composite materials in engine structures has become an article of
faith in the aerospace industry. The unmatched strength and low weight of these
materials allow aircraft to be lighter--increasing their payload capacity,
range, and speed. These advantages will apply to both military and commercial
aircraft.<P>
But the high cost of composite materials restricts their use, especially in the
commercial sector. And the production that does exist today, primarily in the
military sector, has been threatened by Defense downsizing, which has reduced
industry's capacity for composites production.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
The Affordable Composites for Propulsion (ACP) program, funded through the TRP,
focuses on overcoming the barriers that limit the widespread use of composite
materials. Its goal is to provide affordable composites by developing
manufacturing technology and using automated processing techniques. Costs can
then be further reduced for the military through economies of scale associated
with integrating military and commercial industrial bases.<P>
The program will also facilitate large-scale use of polymer matrix composites
that can be used in the propulsion systems of military aircraft. Because of
their large size, these engines require composite materials to keep weights
within acceptable limits. Composites and affordable manufacturing processes
offer weight-saving advantages that are crucial to enabling technologies for
future military and commercial products. The program intends to make the
insertion of composite materials into these products a reality.<P>
For example, the ACP program will be directly applicable to next-generation
ultrahigh-bypass engines, which are key to future military Advanced Tactical
Transport aircraft. This propulsion technology can increase the range of
military transports by 20 percent and increase the on-station time of Airborne
Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft by up to 2 hours. Ultrahigh-bypass
engines also decrease noise levels, which can benefit both military and
commercial users. The ACP program could also apply to the F-119 engine, which
powers the F-22 fighter.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
One of the components being considered under this program is the F-119 Fan
Inlet Case.  This component was added to the program when it became apparent
that some of the manufacturing technologies being developed could be used to
produce a composite Fan Inlet Case. Successful application of ACP manufacturing
technologies will reduce the weight of components by about 40 percent.
Additionally, increased production volumes associated with commercial
applications may save up to 20 percent in costs on F-22 airframe components
using ACP manufacturing processes.
<H3>Making Technology More Affordable Through Commercial Participation</H3>
The coordinated effort of ACP distributes cost and risk among the government
and leaders in the composite industry. Pratt &amp; Whitney leads the industry
consortium, which includes Boeing; Northrop-Grumman; Dow-United Technologies
Composite Products, Inc.; DuPont; and Alliant. Collectively, the ACP team
manufactures more than half the aerospace composite components made in the
United States today.<P>
Widespread commercialization of ACP technology can reduce the costs of future
DoD aircraft and missiles. Low-volume composite military hardware currently is
often manufactured using costly hand operations. Commercial applications will
be high volume, using automated manufacturing so that industry can be cost
competitive. By introducing affordable composites on commercial engines,
industry will double the production base, adding more than a million pounds per
year to the nation's advanced composites production.<P>
Most of the same suppliers supporting the F-22, B-2, and V-22, as well as
rocket motor cases for space and missile systems, will produce these
composites. As a result, they will be able to make weapons systems for a lower
cost or more weapons for the same total cost.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
The ACP program has demonstrated the technical feasibility of widespread
introduction of polymer composites into critical components of next-generation
engines. The competitiveness of these new products depends on the weight
savings and affordability projected for the ACP components. Preliminary design
studies have identified more than 700 pounds of savings per engine. The
composite components are also more affordable than their conventional
counterparts. The key to achieving this improved affordability is reliable
processing and automation made possible through the large production potential
of these components. Resin transfer molding and automated tow placement are the
primary candidates for initial demonstration.<P>
The final affordability obstacle for widespread use of composites is acceptance
by the commercial airlines. More than 15 potential airline customers have been
involved with the ACP industry team to ensure that ACP technology is durable
enough to meet requirements.  Pratt &amp; Whitney has also led efforts with
major aircraft companies to substantiate the performance of engine products,
develop approaches to integrate engines into the aircraft, and initiate
economic forecasts to introduce the product.<P>

<HR>
 The TRP's focus on weapons and survivability began in 1994 to address
dual-use technologies that can directly enhance the military's ability to
fight. While harnessing commercial technology to improve or develop systems in
this area is less apparent than, for example, communications or mobility, there
are some development areas where the military and commercial sectors can work
together. With mass production, these systems will be cheaper and easier for
the military to access. And with the commercial sector setting the pace, the
military will be able to move from prototype to usable system much faster than
if Defense developed it alone.<P>
<HR><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="image/approach.gif"><H2>ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES BRING MAJOR MILITARY BENEFITS</H2><P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="image/ch7_hummer.gif">The airbag, which is
now a standard safety feature for most family cars, has over the past few years been based largely on a tiny solid-state device
that senses acceleration. The same breakthrough that produced this
accelerometer--called microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)--may also
revolutionize rocket and missile safety and arming devices for the military.
MEMS is another TRP focus area where tapping into the commercial sector may
make better and less expensive weapons for tomorrow's military. Smaller,
cheaper, and easier to maintain than the simple mechanical devices used
previously, a MEMS-based weapons safety and arming device also has integrated
electronics that safeguard operation and monitor its ability to work properly
when activated. The technology has proven to be so exciting that the TRP
extended this effort in the fiscal year 1995 solicitation.<P>
In addition, the TRP has chosen to add another focus area under this category
of military needs to exploit technologies for military Operations Other Than
War (OOTW). With the collapse of the Soviet regime, the DoD now finds itself
increasingly involved in OOTW, which includes humanitarian aid and peacekeeping
missions. Since the military requires many of the same skills and equipment
that are used in domestic law enforcement, the OOTW TRP program will address
the needs of both the military and law enforcement. Cost-effective
manufacturing practices and a large dual-use market will lower costs and
improve weapons and protection categories.<P>

PROJECT TITLE: Development of
Monolithic Motion-Detecting Components Made with Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) Technology<P>
A new generation of miniaturized motion-sensing devices is being developed
using semiconductor manufacturing techniques to create tiny moving components
on the surface <BR>of the semiconductor chips.<P>
As microelectronic devices become smaller and less expensive, mechanical
systems such as sensors, actuators, and valves become the limiting factor in
the cost, size, and performance of Defense weapon systems. The development of
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) offers an opportunity to apply the same
miniaturization techniques--successful for semiconductors--to a range of
mechanical systems. With its inherent ability to integrate electronic and
mechanical systems on the same chip, MEMS promises major breakthroughs in the
design and operation of Defense systems.<P>
Analog Devices, Inc., is leading a TRP consortium to use advanced MEMS
technology in developing miniature motion-sensing structures. Such a structure
is small enough to be put on a single integrated circuit with controlling
electronics.
<H3>Answering the Military's Needs with Innovative Solutions</H3>
Lockheed-Martin, a partner in this program, is evaluating the MEMS devices for
use in safe-and-arm (S/A) circuitry for projectiles and missiles. Another
partner, Delco Systems Operations, is evaluating them for rocket and missile
guidance. If successful, these devices would weigh significantly less, perform
better, and be more reliable than other technologies for such applications. The
cost of conventional S/A devices would be dramatically reduced.  The same
device made with MEMS technology would also be 5 to 10 times smaller.
<H3>Into the 21st Century with Advanced Technology</H3>
MEMS technology will revolutionize how electronic sensors are made and what
they can do. The processing of MEMS devices is based on semiconductor
processing, modified with new surface micromachining technology to add
microscopic moving parts. Coupled with powerful signal-processing and interface
circuits, this technology can produce tiny electromechanical sensors such as
micro-accelerometers, microgyroscopes, and even micromechanical filters.<P>
<B>Making Technology Affordable Through Commercial
Participation</B><P>
Using the semiconductor industry as a parallel, MEMS devices will be affordable
to the DoD only if they are manufactured on a high-volume, low-cost production
line that produces millions of devices. Therefore, Defense requires a
commercial avenue to lower costs and ensure availability. In this case, it has
found that avenue in the automobile industry.<P>
The same devices that can determine the speed of a missile can detect a car
crash and activate an air bag. Tapping into the commercial sector, the military
will benefit not only from cost savings but also from the extensive testing and
packaging database needed for the liability exposure and quality requirements
of the automotive industry. These standards are often stricter than military
requirements.
<H3>Where We Are and Where We're Going</H3>
The initial products to be demonstrated on this project include high, medium,
and low g accelerometers and a gyroscope. These MEMS devices are being
evaluated by government agencies and contractors to be inserted into advanced
military and space systems. The capabilities of the system have already been
proved by firing from a military howitzer.<P>

<font size="+1">During the period of time from birth till about age 5, we learn at an incredible rate (i.e., Children taught 2 or 3 languages during this time do not develop an accent.).  We see the world around us as a whole, then break it down into its component parts.
<p>
At about age 5, when we start school, we are taught a different way of learning -- the Rote-Memory System.  <b><i>The Purpose:</i></b>  for dealing with a written language and in preparation of conscious level testing of knowledge gained.  <b><i>Observation:</i></b>  This starts as we learn the alphabet, one character at a time. Then, it proceeds to words, sentences, paragraphs, stories, etc., to build our world from the pieces. <b><i>This creates TUNNEL VISION and is in direct conflict with the natural way of learning we are born with.</i></b> The results are reflected in the above graph. From this point on, learning drops the rest of our lives.
<p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b> By using Subliminal Photography&reg a person can tap into the natural way we learned as children and apply it to the written word at 25,000+ wpm and 100 times the impact of reading.<br>
<img align=middle src="borline.gif">
<p>
<center>
<strong><i>"I used Subliminal Photography&reg on all my technical material.<br>
I am more relaxed, my confidence level has increased,<br>
and I am more organized and productive."</i></strong><br>
Leanette Merrell<br>
Manager of Data Processing<br>
US West Communications
<p>
<strong><i>"Subliminal Dynamics&reg has been an invaluable tool in my business consulting with clients
throughout the world.  It enables me to digest, comprehend, and retain vast amounts of information and data."</i></strong><br>
Charles D. Greenidge, Ph.D.<br>
President<br>
Greenidge & Assoc., Inc.
<p>
<strong><i>"My thinking process was numbed by the rigid educational system at my schools, and I know I used to think with my subconscious when I was young.  Now, I'm learning to think automatically again instead of forcing myself, which most often creates a block. I am more confident about things I do."</i></strong><br>
Connie Liu<br>
Student
<p>
<strong><i>"The program is excellent at accelerating absorption of the material.<br>
I will find it tremendously useful in my practice as well as<br>
in my personal life.  Must do for any professional."</i></strong><br> 
Dr. Sundardas<br>
Naturopathic Physician
<p>
<strong><i>"This course should be in every school in the country.  If it were, we would radically change the
educational system and empower students."</i></strong><br>

<font size="+1">Subliminal Photography&reg is the primary vehicle that expediently creates a very strong rapport between the conscious and the subconscious.  It opens many doors to our vast potential by building these bridges.  As a learning tool, it allows people to assimilate information at 100 times the average reading speed with 100% retention for life.  But, <b>this is not limited to learning</b>. More importantly, it opens a pathway to a part of the brain that has fantastic abilities. This part of the brain acts as a conduit to universal energies. Subliminal Dynamics&reg gives you the tools to <b>take control of your life</b> like never before.
<p>
As the Information Revolution is fully realized by the information capacities of newest computers, the next step must be the <b><i>"Mental Revolution"</i></b>.  To simply "keep up" is not good enough.  Only by getting back to assimilating information as a small child would, can we ever hope to hold our own in today's fast paced market.  By achieving this with the Subliminal Dynamics&reg process, we can take a sufficient chunk out of the stress we endure.  By strengthening and toning the brain in this natural way, we can create a better, healthier, and happier life.<br>

<font size="+1">As Dr. Deepak Chopra points out: a major cause of disease is stress.
<P>
The Subliminal Dynamics&reg  process builds the lines of accessibility to other parts of the brain.  Once
these lines of  communications are established, the use of subconscious programming and
visualization techniques prove to be very effective with reducing stress and promoting health and
wellness.
<p>
Healing becomes a process of creating a harmonic balance of energy patterns because most
illnesses have their roots in the mental, emotional and more subtle energy levels.  Because we are
unable to truly recreate the primal state for reprogramming on a conscious level, we must tap into the
subconscious.  It is unlikely that if a person has no confidence in the power of the mind, he will be
successful.<br>

<font size="+1">Most of us have heard about a time during an athlete's career, there is that one game, or that particular season, there is absolute perfection in everything he or she did.  It is usually referred to as the ZONE.
<p>
The ZONE is never explained to anyone or it is considered a "once-in-a-lifetime" event that no one can control. The ZONE is merely being in the right state of mind to perform any task beautifully. That state of mind is Alpha.  When we are in Alpha, we are more aware and in touch with our subconscious -- where all of our experience and knowledge lie. The Subliminal Dynamics&reg process teaches how to control this function of the mind on a daily basis with ease.<br>
<img align=middle src="borline.gif">
<p>
Imagine the hush of a packed stadium, watching intently, transfixed on a solo diver preparing to make the final dive to win the gold.  To the diver's mind, the only thing that exists is him, the diving board, and the water beneath him.
<p>
In unbroken concentration, he launches himself high in the air as everyone's mind shutters about the end result.  In the mind of the diver, there is an island of calm reassurance, closed to the psychic prattle in the stadium.  The calmness in his mind continues as he enters the water with the sound of perfection. 
<p>

<b>That diver was Greg Louganis in the Olympics.</b>

<font size="+1">This is the secret to successful decision making as companies experience the paradigm shift and move into the 21st century!
<p>
Weston Agor, the author of <b><i>"Intuitive Management"</i></b> and <b><i>"Intuition at the Top"</i></b>, relates his findings about the number one ingredient for management:  the ability to tune in to your intuition, then the guts or good sense to act upon it!
<p>
Subliminal Dynamics&reg teaches the unleashing of this potent natural ability and its many applications. Not only will you learn to tap this hidden resource, but other magnificent natural abilities such as Subliminal Photography&reg.  This ability allows you to assimilate information at two pages per second with 100% retention.  There is a significant increase in comprehension compared to reading or speed-reading while Mentally Photographing&reg.
<p>
Other benefits of the Subliminal Dynamics&reg process include:  dramatically reduced stress, higher energy, less lost time due to illness, a much happier employee, and higher productivity.
<p>
<b>Richard L. Welch</b>, President of Educom, Inc., and Founder of Subliminal Dynamics&reg, is committed to the awareness and expansion of human consciousness worldwide.  Over 21 years of dedicated research has made him a leading-edge explorer in the development and uses of the mind.  He brings innovative and exciting technologies to the world.  Mr. Welch is a well-known speaker and teacher.  He has appeared on numerous television and radio shows.
<p>
The same principles that have allowed Subliminal Dynamics&reg to grow internationally can be incorporated into your organization by teaching the Subliminal Dynamics&reg process to your management and employees.  It will sharpen your current management team and allow the top employees to prepare for the transition into management as your growth accelerates.  Hiring, then promoting new employees, is much simpler than finding qualified managers from outside your company.
<p>
As you look through this site, realize this is where you and your company can make a quantum leap into the future.<br>

When we are stressed out, we need to have some way to release the stress and regain our stability to cope with society.  By accessing our brain's limitless functions to help solve our daily dilemmas and the minute-by-minute mayhem, we can create a life of less stress and have more accomplishments. 
<p>
Our brain is an amazing organ when it comes to relaxation.  It controls blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, all of our muscles, etc.  With the subconscious, we can access those functions and adjust them to relax our body and mind.  Some people would like to learn how to relax, but are afraid that they would be too busy to set time aside to relax.  When someone has a problem like that, they should consider adjusting their priorities.
<p>
The INTENT or importance we put into our daily tasks can effect our ability to relax.  An important task that either is incomplete, mishandled, or forgotten, can disrupt our body from relaxing.  The subconscious knows the priority you gave yourself for each project and tends to hold you to it.  Until you give your body "permission to relax", you may not be able to relax for a long time.
<p>
Subliminal Dynamics&reg uses a specialized relaxation that envolves the conscious and subconscious mind. It is your conscious mind, highly aware and relaxed, that accesses and programs your subconscious to relax and release the tension.
<p>
When using the relaxation and all of the Subliminal Dynamics&reg process, it enables most anyone to become more organized, more successful, more efficient, and more joyful about life.<br>

<font size="+1"><b>Beliefs create our reality.</b> They may be your interpretation of who you are or your interpretation of what others think of your capabilities.  Beliefs are manifested in the conscious mind as well as in the subconscious mind.  The mind must be free of certain beliefs before insight can occur spontaneously.  A quality of this insight is that one sees the "whole" instantaneously, rather than the "parts".  Subliminal Dynamics&reg is a very advanced form of Whole Brain Learning.  This balance will guide you in reaching full benefits during the course.
<p>
You must first realize <b>"you are what you perceive"</b>. Unless you change your inward consciousness, you cannot change the outward reality.  You must see things as a whole and you are a part of that whole.  The outside integrally connects to the inside.  By just using words (conscious level), without going within, limits the results.
<p>
The Subliminal Dynamics&reg Process teaches a person how to program their own subconscious to promote <b>positive changes to their life.</b> This simple, quick <b>non-intrusive </b>format for success can be achieved without the need or intervention of professional therapists.  Many people in the world today wish to keep their personal life confidential.  It gives that person the mechanism to make those changes or address those issues that hold them back.

<p> 
<font size="+2">What you should know, and what you can do.</font>
<p>
<font size="2"><b><i>by Sherrye Henry</i></b><br>
published in Parade magazine on Sunday, March 17, 1996</font><br>
<img align=middle src="borbar.gif">
</center>
<p>
<font size="+1">Even people in their 40s and 50s feel their memory start to slip. "Why can't I remember names?" they sigh. "Where did I put my keys?" With the years, the questions move from annoyance to concern, as in, "Could this be something serious -- like Alzheimer's disease?"
<p>
Today, thanks to advanced imaging techniques, animal studies and better psychological studies, researchers are exploring not only the diseases we fear but also how our brains function -- and age -- normally. Furthermore, they say, we can take positive action to keep our minds active and healthy.
<p>
<b>What we lose.</b> How normal is everyday, garden-variety forgetting? All those words and names "on the tip of the tongue" are still firmly embedded in brain, researchers say, but they can become increasingly hard to retrieve.
<p>
"With age, the memory system is overloaded to begin with," says Dr. Barry Gordon, director of the Cognitive Neurology Division at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.  "You have more  names to remember than before -- and overload can take its toll on memory. Also, the neural machinery may not be working quite as well -- a little slower, a little noisier than before."
<p>
But, he adds, name-blocking also may indicate that you have a rich, healthy network of connections. Because these connections compete with each other, they may inhibit the right word from coming to the surface. That's why relaxing -- turning your attention to something else -- often allows that hidden word to pop out suddenly, or why running through the alphabet jogs your memory.
<p>
But it is also true, say experts, that our brains become more physically vulnerable as they age. Younger brains recover faster from damage than older ones. Our brains also slow down as we age, as nerve cells (neurons) weaken and die. Still, Dr. David Drachman, chairman of the Neurology Department at the University of Massachusetts, says: "We start life with far more neurons than we'll ever need. Cells close ranks and take over for one another, rather like an army that loses soldiers but regroups to keep on fighting." Scientists call this comforting concept "brain reserve".
<p>
It's some reserve: 100 billion neurons, with a trillion connections in each cubic centimeter, firing 10 million billion times each second -- all comprising an infinitely complex chemical factory that weighs less than 3 pounds. The interaction of these connections and their vital chemicals forms the basis of all our stored memories.
<p>
Scientists believe that existing memories stored in the brain are not lost to a significant degree with aging. Instead, the brain structures that enable us to store <i>new</i> memories tend to decline with age. For example, the basal forehead, which manufactures acetylcholine for memory storage, can lose up to half of its cells in normal aging, says Dr. Marilyn Albert, a neuropsychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. This loss is responsible for many lost keys and forgotten names.
<p>
<b>Promising new approaches.</b> Now that scientists better understand memory loss, they are exploring ways to keep critical chemicals flowing, so that our stored memories can be more readily retrieved. Drugs that have substantially delayed memory loss in animals are now being tested. And preliminary studies indicate that melatonin, the hormone believed to aid sleep, also may promote memory retention. Vitamins C and E may play a role in preventing losses in a healthy brain. Estrogen probably plays an important role too, particularly for women.
<p>
<b>What we gain as we age.</b> Aging is not all downhill. Older people have skills and abilities that beat most young people's by a mile, according to Claudia H. Kawas, associate professor of geriatric neurology at Johns Hopkins. That's because aging brains hold larger vocabularies, command a greater understanding of written materials, contain more ability to reason and, overall, display more wisdon -- meaning good judgment based on wide experience.
<p>
"Ask a group of 80-year-olds to phone a particular number on a particular day, and the 80-year-olds will perform far better," Kawas expains, "probably because they have developed more effective strategies, like making lists of things to do." Kawas has her own definition of aging: "It's the loss of adaptability," she says. "As long as you can adapt new strategies to accomplish tasks, you are a successful ager."
<p>
<b>Alzheimer's and the normal brain.</b> Two-thirds of us probably won't even notice natural memory loss that occurs with age, according to a recent study. And not being able to name all the palyers in a movie or forgetting occasionally where one's car is parked does not for most people signify the start of Alzheimer's disease, where loss of memory and intellectual ability is relentlessly progressive. Marilyn Albert draws the line this way: "It's not when you lose your keys that matters but when you finally find them and can't remember leaving them there."
<p>
Dr. Albert is working on finding ways to discriminate between normal aging-related memory loss and Alzheimer's disease, which devastates the memories of some 4 millions Americans -- 10 percent of all people between the ages of 65 and 86. Identifying the disease early, through an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), for example, will allow us "to intervene when effective treatments are developed," she explains.
<p>
And Alzheimer's research is advancing. "The rate of breakthoughs now is so rapid that, before the year 2000, we're likely to see initial drug trials to slow the progress of the disease," says Dr. Dennis J. Selkoe, a professor of neurology and a researcher at the Harvard Medical School.
<p>
<b>Keep your brain fit.</b> Brain scientists offer the following suggestions for a healthy brain at any age:
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Eat less.</i> Brains burn calories like all body tissues. By burning fewer calories, says Dr. Drachman, our cells produce less toxic substances called oxygen free radicals, which damage either our DNA or our mitochondria -- "the little furnaces" in cells that generate energy for all life's processes.
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Avoid harmful substances.</i> Excessive drinking and drug abuse are thought to damage brain cells.
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Challenge yourself.</i> Reading widely, keeping mentally active and learning new skills strengthens the brain connections and promotes new ones the way weight-lifting develops muscles.
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Trust yourself more.</i> If people feel they have control over their lives, their brain chemistry actually improves.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Keep your memory sharp.</b> A 1993 study found that formal schooling was strongly associated with a healthy brain in 1200 highly functioning people aged 70 to 79. But Dr. Richard Mohs -- director of the division of psychology at New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine and one of the study's investigators -- says the following strategies can help keep your memory sharp, regardless of your schooling and years:
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Relax.</i> Tension may prolong a memory lapse.
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Pay attention.</i> Concentrate on what you want to remember.
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Minimize and resist distractions.</i>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Use a notepad and carry a calendar.</i>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Take your time.</i>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Organize belongings.</i> Designate a place for "unforgettables".
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Repeat names of new acquaintances in conversation.</i>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Memory myths.</b> Dr. Barry Gordon, the author of <i>Memory: Remembering and Forgetting in Everyday Life</i>, debunks some popular misconceptions about aging and memory:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Myth 1:</b><i> Forgetfulness is a sign that something is wrong with your brain.</i>
</ul>
<ul><i>Fact:</i> If we didn't possess the capacity to forget, we'd all go crazy. The ability to remember what is important and discard the rest is a skill to be treasured.
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Myth 2:</b><i> You lose 10,000 brain cells a day, and one day you just run out.</i>
</ul>
<ul><i>Fact:</i> An exaggerated fear. Some parts of the brain do lose nerve cells, but not where the process of thinking takes place. You lose some nerve connections, but it's possible to grow new ones or maintain the connections you have by exercising your mind.
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Myth 3:</b><i> The more memory problems bother you, the more serious they are.</i>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul><i>Fact:</i> A huge range of ability exists across the general population. (Even a single individual experiences variations in memory over the course of a lifetime.)

<font size="+1">One-forth of all Americans are Dyslexic.  As there are seven different types of Dyslexia, many go undiagnosed.  Since schools teach the Rote-Memory System,  most of these students struggle through school -- if they make it at all.  Many simply cannot read.  Whenever they are given something to read, they put it aside and do their own thing.  That brings another problem -- lack of concentration or a weakened attention span.  This leads to many being misdiagnosed as Attention Deficit Disorder.  Some estimates indicate of all ADD labeled students, up to 90% may be Dyslexic.
<p>
In reality, Dyslexia may be an asset.  For instance, since most Dyslexics have a difficult time reading, they tend to develop their other senses more.  They can utilize the brain's ability to change and create perceptions. They are more visual -- thinking in pictures more than words.  They are highly intelligent and very creative. As long as the extended development of their other senses continues and is not destroyed by the school system and/or parents, Dyslexia can be a gift beyond the ability to read.  Look at all the famous DYSLEXIC GENIUSES!</font>

Why Some of the Smartest People Can't Read and How They Can Learn<br>
by Ronald D. Davis with Eldon M. Braun 
<P>
<font size="+3">They did it BECAUSE of DYSLEXIA!</font>
</center>
<p>
<font size="+1">The people listed above may seem they had a miracle happen that made them who they became.  So then, how can Dyslexics all around the world learn without a lot of reading?
<p>
<font size="+2">SOLUTION:</font><br>
<b>Subliminal Photography&reg bypasses Dyslexia or the "inability to read."</b>
<p>
Subliminal Photography&reg starts at 100 TIMES the average reading speed* or 25,000+ wpm.  At this rate, Dyslexia cannot interfere with the assimilation of information because the information is not focused on by the eyes.  The information is gained in full page format with 100 times the impact of reading.
<p>
<font size="2">*average reading speed is approximately 250 words per minute</font><br>

<strong><i>"I took the Subliminal Dynamics&reg course in 1990.  I have been a severe dyslexic all of my life and had found  reading anything unbearable.<br>
Now I am able to Mentally Photograph&reg all of my material for law school with confidence.  This gives me complete recall and understanding of the material.  My whole life has changed by applying the Subliminal Dynamics&reg process.  Now I can learn anything!  If I can do it with my learning disability, it will work for anyone! Just use the whole process exactly how it is taught."</i></strong><BR>

<font size=+1">Neuro-Scientists have recently discovered that even though neurons (brain cells) decrease with age, the dendrites (memory storage compartments of each brain cell) can be stimulated to grow more in
number. This increases memory capacity. This growth is stimulated by "Whole Brain Learning", i.e., Albert Einstein played the violin to establish this hemispheric balance. Scientists claim that Whole Brain Learning can be used to prevent Alzheimer's Disease.  [Life Magazine; July 1994]
<p>
<b>Subliminal Photography&reg is a very accelerated method of Whole-Brain Learning.</b>
Thus, one can assume that the rate of dendritic growth will likewise be accelerated. This also
exercises and strengthens neural pathways that may be weak or unused.  Subliminal Dynamics&reg
students often find new accessibility to more memory and latent talents and abilities.<br>

Imagine this:  A solo pianist watched by thousands in the audience, or perhaps millions by television.  The only things that are real to the pianist is herself/himself, the piano, and the  flow of music -- nothing else in the world matters; he/she is totally locked in.  Emotions well up within the pianist.  They too, flow with the music to the audience with such beautiful intensity.

<font size="+1">By Mentally Photographing&reg such books as the Dictionary and Thesaurus, a person gains a much needed working vocabulary.  This includes synonyms, antonyms, spelling, and pronunciation. 
Also gained is a much deeper understanding of the meaning and application of words. This
allows children (age 7 & above) to attend the same course as adults and be tested using the
same 11th grade materials.<br>

<font size="+1">Awareness.  How aware do you think you are?  One day you could be doing several tasks at once and being AWARE of what everyone is saying, effortlessly.  The next day, you could be doing the same thing and someone calls for you from across the room.  Your mind would not even register that someone is standing there, much less hear their voice.  What controls this function?  Believe it or not, it IS you.
<p>
When you are confronted with a task, your subconscious decides right then how important that task is compared to all the other tasks you have planned for that day.  Your subconscious has your "set of rules" to determine if the task is important and, if so, how important.
<p>
Hypothetically, your subconscious decides, with the "set of rules" it presently has, that the task is not important enough and sets a low priority for that task.  Even if you know it has to be done, your subconscious has already set the priority for that task.  If your subconscious does not receive a higher priority for that task from you, the conscious mind, the task will stay at a lower priority and probably not be completed or worse -- you will totally forget about it.
<p>
Our SUBCONSCIOUS INTENT has everything to do with completing anything.  If we do not have a strong enough intent, we are wasting our time, and maybe someone else's.<br>
<img align=middle src="borline.gif">
<p>
Perception and Intuition.  The average person's peripheral vision is about 100 degrees.  It is good enough to get us where we are going, for the most part.  At times, though, we all could have used an extra 100 degrees.  Peripheral vision is the amount of extended space on either side of a focal point that a person can see without removing their eyes from that point.
<p>
For all of us that like to be more AWARE of our surroundings, peripheral vision can be extended up to 220 degrees.  A part of the Subliminal Dynamics&reg process enables one to expand peripheral vision, even up to 360 degrees!
<p>
You are probably saying "NO WAY!".  If you are, you are technically correct.  The human eye is incapable of 360 degree peripheral vision, but by expanding the peripheral vision to its extreme, a person can heighten their AWARENESS to compensate for the other 140 degrees.
<p>
What happens to someone when they have 360 degrees peripheral vision and AWARENESS?  They have a NEW PERCEPTION* of the world around them. What would you do if you developed this?  Many Subliminal Dynamics&reg students express this latent sense as premonition, INTUITION, precognition, and the "gut-feeling" that a lot of us get, but are hesitant to trust.
<p>
<CENTER>
* Expert martial artists can sense their complete surroundings.
</CENTER>
<P>
A good definition of INTUITION is the ability of having the correct solution without CONSCIOUSLY knowing all the details in between. Intuition is considered by some a passing emotion, nonsensical or just plain indigestion.  How absurd!  Do they expect the subconscious to take a physical form and jump out in front of them to tell them what is going on?  I certainly hope not!
<p>
The brain uses our body to communicate information to us.  How do we know we are sick?  Our throat gets a scratchy feeling and our nasal passages clog with mucus.  How did we develop the common sense to not step on a tack barefoot? We could experiment, but our common sense would not allow us.  So, we can have a hypothetical situation without common sense -- a child, if you will.  A child sees a tack on the floor, pointy side up, and steps on it.  Before the child even puts their foot more than a millimeter on the tack, the nerves in the foot send an urgent message to the spinal cord to tell the muscles of the leg to IMMEDIATELY pull the foot upwards at all costs.  While the leg is then lifted, the message is forwarded to the brain, where it records it and assigns it a response, "OUCH!"
<p>
By learning to access the subconscious with Subliminal Dynamics&reg, a person can be in control and utilize an infinite amount of information to base their decisions and open a new world of opportunity.

<img align=middle src="borbar.gif">
</CENTER>
<p>
<font size="+1">In October 1975, after fifteen highly successful years in the financial planning industry, and one year of retirement at the age of thirty-four, Mr. Richard Welch bought the American Speed-Reading
Academy of Phoenix, Arizona.
<p>
After two months of operating the school, Mr. Welch held a staff meeting and informed the teaching
staff of his desire to innovate and improve the product.  He wanted a course that would consistently
attain results surpassing those attained by the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics course, and, if
possible, in less time.  Their course and his were currently producing about 2,000 words per minute --
theirs in seven weeks, his in ten weeks.
<p>
Within thirty days some startling things began to take place in the classroom.  Several students were
reading faster than 10,000 words per minute, and a few were exceeding 40,000 words per minute. 
Mr. Welch's initial reaction was skepticism, but following another staff meeting, he decided to re-write the course outline and implement into the course the innovations that appeared to contribute
to the remarkable increase in reading speed.
<p>
He formed three pilot classes, ten students each.  The classes included participants of many ages and
occupations.  Among the thirty people were a nine year old child and a seventy-two year old man. 
After ten weeks, the results were in -- and it astounded him!  The average graduate had exceeded
40,000 words per minute and the average increase in rate of comprehension was 28%.  Several
students had broken an existing world record in speed-reading, which researched to be 100,000
words per minute, with increased comprehension.  Two students, a sixteen year old boy and a thirty-five year old accountant, exceeded 175,000 words per minute and were still climbing.  The accountant, Bob Scott, decided to continue working with the method once a week to find his limit. 
<p>
A few weeks later, he peaked at an amazing <font size=+1>422,000 words per minute</font> and tested with 85% comprehension on completely foreign material.  Mr. Welch then felt sure he had found an entirely new method of speed-reading, or something like speed-reading, that when taught, produced unbelievable
results with virtually anyone.  He sent his speed-reading staff to libraries to read everything they could
find on speed-reading, reading, the brain, and eye-brain coordination.  He also continued working and
testing his new methods in the classroom.
<p>
Arizona State University Psychology Department staff performed independent tests funded by Mr.
Welch.  Control groups from the campus and students provided by Mr. Welch were used in the
testing.  These tests confirmed that anyone with average intelligence can learn to read at astounding
speeds up to <font size=+1>2,000,000 words per minute</font> -- with increased comprehension.  This was achieved by flashing information at forty milliseconds on a Tachistoscope. Tests performed by the Phoenix elementary school district confirmed that young children, fourth and fifth grades, could rapidly
grasp his method.  It raised their reading and vocabulary skills several years with only a few hours
of using this method.
<p>
During research conducted from 1976 to 1978, Doctor Herbert Otto was consulted.  Dr. Otto,
Director of the Human Potentialities Research Project for the National Center for Exploration
of Human Potential, in La Jolla, California, encouraged Richard Welch to continue his research and
suggested he should protect it by using his own funds so that nothing could be published during the
development of this amazing process.  Mr. Welch incorporated the Company under the name of
International Speed-Reading Institute, Inc. in June 1978.
<p>
In 1979, after moving the Company to San Jose, California, Mr. Welch began more testing and
research to find new applications for the process now known as Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</font>.  The speed-reading application was then re-named Subliminal Photography<font size="1">&reg</font>, which more accurately described the phenomena.  Mr. Welch also coined the phrase "Welcome To Tomorrow"<font size="1">&reg</font>.
<p>
As the testing continued, it became obvious that the part of the brain being applied had remarkable
abilities and it was primarily unexplored territory.  The method of Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</font> was then under a "trade secret" and put under lock and key for protection.
<p>
What came to life in 1975 was essentially a speed-reading course with more hidden potential
than developer Richard Welch ever dreamed of.  Like an exceptional child, it grew, developed ideas
of its own, made friends in high places, acquired the name Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</font> and reached adulthood in 1984.  Now it is more than just a speed-reading course.  Like the child prodigy it was, it continues to amaze people who find themselves shaking their heads in wonderment at the results.
<p>
Over 15,000 people have learned this evolving process.  In 1984, its simplification allowed the course
to be taught in four three-hour sessions.  I.Q.'s ranging from retarded to genius and ages ranging from
5 to 92 have been tested.  The success ratio is over 98%.  As research is constantly being done and
innovations are tested, the addition of new material in 1994 expanded the course to four four-hour lessons.
<p>
The tremendous growth experienced by our company is primarily due to student referrals.  People
from all backgrounds -- students, business and industry, education, professionals, law enforcement,
military, scientists, and others -- learned the method successfully.  The applications of this process
are limitless -- and the implications are extraordinary as research continues.
<p>
Richard Welch, President, and Donna Welch, Executive Vice President, have appeared on numerous radio and television shows.  Based in Colorado, they and their fine staff commit to teaching
Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</font> using the most innovative methods available.  Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</font> is currently expanding worldwide and opening new foreign marketplaces.
<p>
Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</font> is a Whole-Life Enhancement Course, not a photographic memory course. The techniques and applications of the Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</font> process are solely for educational use. The Certified Instructors and Educom, Inc. d.b.a. Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</font> do not intend to present any part of this work as a diagnosis or prescription for any ailment of any student, nor do they take responsibility for anyone misrepresenting the process through such action.</font><br>

<b>Q: Is Subliminal Photography&reg /Mental Photography&reg the same as speed-reading?
<p>
<ul>A: NO.</b>  Subliminal Photography&reg /Mental Photography&reg is a different brain function from reading or speed-reading. The mechanics and the pathway of the information through the brain
are different.
</ul>
<P>
<b>Q: Who can be successful with the Subliminal Dynamics&reg Process?
<p>
<ul>A: </b>We are all born with these abilities.  You never lose them.  We were trained out of using them. Our research shows students ranging from ages 5 to 93 and represent many learning disabilities and I.Q.'s from severely retarded (58) to genius can do this, as long as you believe in yourself.
</ul>
<P>
<b>Q.: What are subliminals?
<p>
<ul>A.: </b>Subliminals are audible or visual information presented below the level of conscious perception.
</ul>
<P>
<b>Q.: Do you sell Subliminal Tapes?
<p>
<ul>A.: NO.</b> We do not recommend them.  We show you how to do these things for yourself much more effectively.  We put you in charge of your own subconscious.
</ul>
<p>
<ul>Our investigations show that there are 4 basic types of messages on Subliminal Tapes and Videos:<BR>
<ul>1.   Good message - covers most people<BR>
2.   Good message -- only for a few people<BR>
3.   Placebo -- no message<BR>
4.   Harmful message -- destructive<BR></ul>
<p>You must have highly technical equipment to decipher what the real message is -- recommendations are don't bother buying them.<BR>
</ul>
<img align=middle src="borline.gif">
<p>
<font size="+2"><b>CORPORATIONS</b></font>
<P>
<b>Q:     What does an employee gain through the use of the Subliminal Dynamics&reg process?<BR>
<ul>A:</b><ul>1.   Stress reduction<BR>
2.   Self-assurance<BR>
3.   Self-motivation<BR>
4.   Proficiency in work<BR>
5.   Attention to detail<BR>
6.   Less accident-prone (Higher awareness)<BR>
7.   Develops a sense of pride in workmanship<BR>
8.   Enhances creativity<BR></ul>
<p>
By using the Subliminal Dynamics&reg process, an employee does not only enhance their
work, but they can apply this to enhance their entire life.
</ul>
<P>
<b>Q:     What does the corporation gain through the use of the Subliminal Dynamics&reg 
  process?<br>
<ul>A:</b><ul>1.   Increase in profitability<BR>
2.   Decrease in accident rate<BR>
3.   Increase in quality<BR>
4.   Ability to assess and anticipate the customer's needs<BR>
5.   Develops a cohesive infrastructure that allows the management and employees to work as a team with two-way communication<BR></ul>
<p>
One of the deepest desires of a person is to feel worth.  In this age of corporate down-sizing, many employees do not feel this sense of worth.<br>
</ul>

<p>
<font size="+1">Subliminal Dynamics&reg is a process that involves one's perception of the world and beliefs in one's capabilities to carry out a meaningful and productive life. Some people do not realize that the key to mental and physical well-being is in the subconscious mind.<br>
<img align=middle src="borline.gif">

<b><i>"If you think you can, if you think you can't, you're right."</i>- Henry Ford</b>
</center><br>
<img align=middle src="borline.gif">
<p>
Identifing important functions of your subconscious mind, such as control of pulse rate, regeneration of cells, and ridding the body of toxins, enables one to realize how important the subconscious mind is. 
<p>
Once one knows how to access and correct a subconscious function, it can dramatically change one's perception of the world and beliefs in one's capabilities.<br>

<img align=middle src="borline.gif">
<p>
Subliminal Photography&reg raises one's ability to interact with the information overload present today.  It bypasses the effects of Dyslexia, ADD, and other "Learning Disabilities".  Subliminal Photography&reg is an important part, but must be used with other functions of the subconscious mind to produce a stronger, clearer pathway between the subconscious and conscious mind.
<p>
Subliminal Dynamics&reg keeps one growing mentally and opens possibilities that were never thought of before.<br>
<img align=middle src="borline.gif">
<p>
<b><i>There is only one constant in the equation of life -- CHANGE!</i></b><br>
<img align=middle src="borline.gif">
<p>
Investigate the <a href="subdyn.html#seclabel">Areas of Interest</a> and think of things in your life that you want to see changed in a positive way.  The Subliminal Dynamics&reg process is not limited to learning, but can change all facets of life.
<p>
The Subliminal Dynamics&reg process is presented in 4 lessons over 4 consecutive days.  Each lesson lasts approximately 4 to 5 hours.

<img align=middle src="borbar.gif">
</center>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Paul Scheele of Learning Strategies</b> invented the term "PhotoReading<font size="1">TM</FONT>" after attending a Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</FONT> Course in October 1985.  In the Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</FONT> Course he attended as a student, one of the subjects covered was Subliminal Photography<font size="1">&reg</FONT> / Mental Photography<font size="1">&reg</FONT>. This technique, along with other techniques, have been taught by Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</FONT> since 1975.
<p>
<b>Three months after Paul Scheele attended</b> the Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</FONT> Course in October 1985, he started a company called PhotoReading<font size="1">TM</FONT>, apparently based in part on what he learned in the Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</FONT> Course, even though he was never involved with the research and development of Subliminal Dynamics<font size="1">&reg</FONT> or Subliminal Photography<font size="1">&reg</FONT> / Mental Photography<font size="1">&reg</FONT>.

<font size="+1"><b><i>This is a letter from a former PhotoReading student regarding a refund request to Peter Bissonette, the current President of Learning Strategies / PhotoReading.  Paul Scheele is now acting as CEO.  This letter represents the large number of people that are concerned about the quality and integrity of PhotoReading and what they teach:</i></b>
<p>
"Most of the class time was spent on standard speed reading techniques, such as preview, skimming, review (they use other terms to describe it).  <b>The 'Photo' part is, as best I could tell, more a gimmick than a real technique.</b> After doing the 'Photo' process you still have to go back and apply standard reading and/or speed reading techniques to 'activate' the information. Without the 'activation' step they assert that your subconscious' knows the information but you don't have conscious access to it.
<p>
<b>The brochure I have from them says "...mentally photograph</b> the printed page at rates exceeding a page per minute..." but the class teaches, in effect, that's an undeveloped photograph and if you want to know what was in the picture you have to go back and use other techniques -- skimming if you want a general idea of the material, and maybe old-fashioned reading and study if you want detailed understanding. Our instructor wasn't able to demonstrate anything better than this.
<p>
<b>In discussing my refund with Peter Bissonette, president of Learning Strategies Inc. which developed Photo Reading, he admitted to me that's about how it is -- but he still asserted that on the whole it's a more effective reading method than anything else out there. Maybe so, but the spread between promise versus delivery was too great for me.</b>
<p>
It DOES teach some useful (standard) speed reading/learning techniques. But if you really want to read 12,000 WPM, then question them very carefully on just what they mean by that claim versus what you're expecting.
<p>
(From: Fred F.)<br>
<img align=middle src="borline.gif">
<p>
<b><i>Subliminal Dynamics recommendation:  If you want to learn speed-reading, you can select any number of books that you can use to teach yourself at much less cost than attending PhotoReading.
<p>
Subliminal Dynamics is the ONLY company that teaches the Subliminal Photography / Mental Photography properly.  We pioneered it over 21 years ago, and have taught it successfully ever since.</i></b><br>

<title>Problem Solving The Creative Way</title>

<font size="+3">PROBLEM-SOLVING<br>
THE CREATIVE WAY</FONT>
<p>
<font size="2"><b><i>By Ang Seng Chai</i></b><br>
published by New Straits Times on Saturday, May 18, 1996</font><br>
<img align=middle src="borbar.gif">
</center>
<p>
<font size="+1">It is amazing how quickly we pass judgment before we even give a person a fair hearing. Ideas are immediately dismissed as unworkable.  Comments like "It has been tried before", "It will never work" and "It's too costly or time-consuming" are often passed.  In the process, enthusiasm and creativity are stifled.  Seldom are remarks like "Let's give it a try" or "Yes, it might just work" expressed.
<p>
Doubting Thomas's are bound to be in our midst.  Yet, time and again, they have been proven to wrong. The past is full of such examples.  There was a time when people thought that flight was impractical, if not impossible.
<p>
Speaking movies were regarded as a pipe dream.  D.W. Griffith, a film maker, remarked in 1920: "When a century has passed, all thoughts of our so-called speaking movies will have been abandoned.  It will never be possible to synchronize the voice with the picture."  Similarly, the "horseless carriage" was predicted to be a luxury for the wealthy only and would not become as common as the bicycle. We have been wrong on all three counts.
<p>
New horizons are continuously being created.  The latest in anything soon becomes outdated.  There seems to be no end to human ingenuity and creativity.  Consider the numerable inventions that technology has given us, such as the cellular phone, the compact disc and the robotic factory assembly.  Who knows what the future will bring us.  What do we need to ensure that we continuously improve on what we have already achieved?
<p>
We need a mind open to all possibilities.  We need to think creatively.  Unfortunately, we do not do so habitually because the emphasis in our society -- at home, in school and at work -- has always been on logical thinking.  From the day a child is born, he is continuously told how to behave himself.  By the time he becomes a teenager, he has lost most of the freedom that he was born with and with it, the ability to function creatively.
<p>
Let us see whether this is true.  When a group of managers were asked at a training course to guess the occupation of the persons in the picture (left), two things happened:
<ul><li>it took a good two or three minutes and some prodding by the course leader before anyone dared to venture an answer; and<br
<li>the answers received were all agreeable ones.
</ul>
If we were asked the same question, we would behave in exactly the same manner.  Our answers pertaining to the person on the left would be very carefully though-out ones, such as a banker, a lawyer, a doctor or some such professional person.  None of us would have dared to suggest that he could also be a <i>char koay teow</i> seller or a hawker.  "Hawkers do not wear a suit.  Only executives do" -- that's what we all think.  Why?  This is because we are afraid of being wrong and being laughed at.  In short, we are always thinking logically.
<p>
You may ask," What is wrong with that?"  The answer lies in the fact that if we are looking for the right answer, we will cease to look for other possible answers, which may be even better.  It is like the lady saying "Yes" to the first man who proposes to her.  She denies herself the advantage of considering alternatives and, perhaps, better choices.
<p>
One may think that creative thinking is opposed to logical thinking.  This is not true.  In fact, they complement each other.  In creative thinking, we seek to generate as many ideas as possible.  We are not concerned for the time being whether the ideas are practical.  We brainstorm by keeping an open mind.  Once we have generated enough ideas, we then apply logical thinking to evaluate the soundness of these ideas.  This way we have a choice of several possible solutions to select from.
<p>
In logical thinking, we deny ourselves this choice.  Because we are looking for the right answer from the start, the moment we think we think we have found a workable solution, we start developing it and stop looking for alternatives without realising that there could be even better solutions.
<p>
Let's look at the benefits of applying creative thinking in solving common problems.  A man who lent a friend RM5,000 was worried that he would not get his money back as his friend was in the habit of conveniently forgetting what he owed others.  The former needed something in black and white in case his worst fears came true.  An obvious solution was to ask him to sign a I.O U. note.  However, the friend might not cooperate.  He thought about his problem and came up with several possible solutions -- the most creative of which was to write to his friend claiming a debt of RM10,000.  He immediately received a reply protesting that the sum owed was only RM5,000.  It was a quick and effective solution.  His worries were over.
<p>
The above example shows that most problems in life have more than one possible solution.  Creative thinking enables us to apply the best of them.  Because we are set in our ways, we constantly impose unnecessary limits on ourselves.  We also have a tendency to evaluate ideas too quickly.  By operating on automatic pilot, we are inclined to jump to conclusions.  We do not challenge the obvious.  We look for the easy way out .  Finally, we are slow to change our old ways of doing things.
<p>
A woman gave away an expensive fish that her husband caught because it would not fit into her frying pan.  It did not occur to her to either use a bigger pan or to cut the fish into smaller pieces.  That was the pan she had always used and her mother before her and if the fish was too large for the pan, then it was of no use to her.
<p>
In creative thinking, no idea is too ridiculous to be considered.  Not only should we not evaluate the ideas of others, we should not evaluate our own ideas if we want to think creatively.
<p>
When chairing a meeting, we should be on guard against any evaluation of ideas at the creative thinking stage.  When someone does this, we should check him by saying; "That's an evaluation" or "Let's have the idea first and worry about its practicality later".
<p>
A general manager once confided to a consultant that he had ceased holding meetings with his executives because he was the only one doing the talking.  Little did he realize that he was the cause of it.  Creative thinking is not a new management technique.  As the quotation below shows, the great Chinese Philosopher, Lao Tzu, who lived more than 2,000 years ago, knew a thing or two about this matter.  This was what he said:<br>
<ul><b><i>A good traveler has no fixed plans<br>
and is not intent upon arriving.<br>
A good artist lets his intuition<br>
lead him wherever it wants.<br>
A good scientist has freed himself<br>
of concepts and keeps his mind open to what is.</i></b>
</ul>
<p>
We have a lot to learn from children.  Children are naturally creative.  They are bubbling with energy and effusive with ideas.  The story is told of a Sunday school teacher who asked her class how they could secure forgiveness for sin.  Up shot a hand and a child replied: "First, teacher, we have to commit a sin." That's creative thinking!
<p>
Our lives will be richer and happier when we start to apply creative thinking to solve problems and make decisions.  To do this, we need to restore the child in us.
<p>
As Dr. Edward De Bono (the guru of creative or "lateral" thinking, as he calls it) said we need also to be a little crazy.  When we do this, we might find that even the most outlandish idea may just work.

<font size="+1">The secret is out.  In business, intuition is beginning to be recognized as an important strategic-planning tool for the 21st century.  Intuition is no longer seen as a special gift bestowed upon a chosen few.  It enables the executive to grasp an intuitive solution during a slow period, a bleak time, or in the face of a changing economy.  Intuition is the power that fuels, feeds, and ignites your vision.  Intuition is a spark that leads to success.
<p>
The hunch, gut feeling, judgment call, sudden insight, or flash out of the blue are all evidence of intuition, a sixth sense that can generate correct decisions even before all the facts are in.  In this information age, we need to hone our intuitive skills just to process the voluminous data.
<p>
Hundreds of top-level executives integrate intuition with logic in decision-making to catapult their companies to the leading edge of their respective industries.  You may not hear anyone say out loud that "my intuition told me" to build a new facility, hire a particular candidate, adopt a radical marketing campaign, start a company, or even risk a merger.  Listen closely, though, and you may hear mention of a hunch, gut feeling, or making a judgment call before taking such a risk.  None disregarded the logic or facts and figures, but each used intuitive input when needed to buttress the facts and figures of a complex situation.  They confidently listened to the intuitive voice in order to remain open to new possibilities, even though they may not have attached the intuitive label to the process.
<p>
Intuition has successfully bridged the gap between cultures where different interpretation or words are used to communicate the ideas.  When John Brockman, an executive in international sales, receives a telex from Taiwan, he knows it is not going to be expressed in the same English that is used in the United States. He has to tap his intuition to make assumptions and go beyond the apparent facts to determine what the message really means.  If a sales manager in Taiwan tells Brockman he is facing a crisis, the situation may not be articulated clearly.  Brockman needs to "read between the lines," relying upon intuition about what the manager really needs to do.
<p>
Whatever words you use to characterize the mind's imaginative leap, many rely on intuition when they take unprecedented risks.  Intuition can come as a flash or as a flow of ideas, each one sparkling the next until you have an explosion of innovative thoughts and actions.  I doubt if Paul Fireman realized he was putting on his intuitive hat when he decided to purchase the rights to an unknown British trademark called Reebok and began manufacturing "aerobic" shoes under that name.  At that time, the "aerobic exercise" boom was nonexistent, and the small pockets of activity could hardly foretell what was to come.  In addition, the "aerobic" shoe was being manufactured with garment leather, which was much softer that the traditional leather used in tennis shoes.  It was questionable whether this leather was strong enough to keep the toes from popping through during intense exercise.  A finely tuned intuitive sense helped Fireman pick up on the whispered beginnings of a major trend.  The risky decision he made is one of the remarkable success stories of recent times.  Basically, it all began as a hunch.
<p>
Intuition has been a powerful tool in helping the executive to innovate, create, and sail into proverbial uncharted waters.  Many such breakthroughs could not have occured without input from the intuitive mind.
<p>
Frequently, an intuitive flash will reveal a new approach or solution to a problem.  Anyone with a sweet tooth will enjoy the example of Mrs. Fields Cookies.  When customers failed to appear the day Debbie Fields opened her first store, a flash of intuition prompted her to grab a cookie sheet filled with cookie, walk down the street, and offer free samples to anyone she met.  Almost instantly her store was filled with patrons. Now, 17 years later, the success of that first store has multiplied to 600 stores scattered throughout the United States and five other countries.
<p>
Jim Adamson, now the CEO of Burger King, talks about his experience in the clothing business, where intuition is used to predict customer behavior.  "Early in my career, when I was with GAP, I was on a buying trip in the Far East.  I picked out GAP's first imported jeans, and I bought far more than the numbers said.  To make a long story short, when they arrived, they sold out in less than 30 days.  I thought I had bought a four-month supply.  I had made a good decision on style and overbought based on my intuition.  I just didn't know how good my intuition was."
<p>
Dan Henslee, President of Hekman Furniture in Grand Rapids, Michigan, knows firsthand how effective a hunch can be.  When he came upon the latest census figures showing that the projected number of people working from their homes in the 1980's and '90s would increase, his intuitive mind sparked a vision of an office in every home.  Introducing the concept of manufacturing residential desks to his board of directors was risky for Henslee since residential desks were not doing well at that time, but his hunch turned out to be so successful and profitable for the company that it placed an awesome burden on their manufacturing capabilities.  Hekman introduced 11 desk models and sold almost five times what his projections were.
<p>
How can you keep the intuitive battery charged and consistently reliable?  Any of the following techniques will help.  And don't worry that they might seem a little airy.  Intuition may not be quantifiable, but nearly everyone agrees there is something to it. At least give it a try.
<ul><li><i>Keep a journal as a track record of your hunches and intuitive flashes.</i><br>
This will sensitize you to the many times, ways, and places where your intuitive mind speaks to you.  Some of your entries might be rather trivial, while others will be more weighty and evidential.  All share the common function of showing you that your intuitive signals are definitely working.  Leave room under each entry to note when and how (and if) the "hunch" is validated.  As you collect your intuitive flashes and hunches, note how they come: on the job, relating to others, with family, scoping the current events, and so on.
<p>
<li><i>Use internal brainstorming to retrieve new possibilities you never would have entertained from your logical mind.</i><br>
Close your eyes to minimize distraction, take a few deep breaths, and imagine you are looking at a chalkboard: Under the word "Pro," mentally list all the positive ways to solve your particular problem. As you visualize these ideas, does one solution stand out as if the highlighted with a glowing neon light? These ideas will stay with you as you now imagine the word "Con" at the top of the chalkboard. Mentally list all the factors that interfere with the possible solutions. do any negative influences stand out?  How does looking at these advantages and disadvantages help you answer your question or arrive at a solution?  As your intuitive mind to reveal the best idea(s) by having them shine brightly, as in a Las Vegas marquee.
<p>
<li><i>Invent games to strengthen your intuitive muscle.</i><br>
Playing such games is not frivolous.  Ask your co-workers to guess who will arrive first at the weekly staff meeting, or who will say the first words.  If you will be meeting someone new, visualize what this person looks like before the actual meeting takes place.  Imagine his or her physical features, what he or she is wearing, and anything such as a briefcase is being carried.
<p>
<li><i>Use the metaphor technique to activate intuition and provide insight into another person's character.</i><br>
Are you trying to understand the puzzling actions of a colleague?  As you think of this person, ask, "If this person were an animal, what type of animal would he or she be?" Be receptive to any images that emerge spontaneously. The intuitive mind will help you interpret these images. If the animal that comes to mind is a bear, words like "ferocious," "huge," "scavenging," and "furry" come to mind, and then you remember that a bear can also be cuddly and huggable.  Although this person appears to be gruff or menacing, he or she may also be approachable.  You can use other descriptive metaphors as you compare the person to a character from a book, a well-known personality, or perhaps a song or book title.
<p>
<li><i>Dreams should be taken seriously since they are one way the inner intuitive mind communicates with the more outwardly aware mind.</i><br>
For many people, the intuitive gateway is opened through their dreams. When faced with a problem, have you ever said, "I have to sleep on it"? For example, if you have to choose between two compelling candidates for a managerial position, the dream advisor might show you shaking the hand of the "right candidate."
<p>
Credit the wisdom in your dreams by keeping a notepad by your bed to write them down.  With practice, you can recall your dreams ad then use your intuition to help interpret their often puzzling symbolism. decoding symbols is the detective part of dream work, a task made easier if you keep a record.
<p>
<li><i>Practice guided imagery.</i><br>
The intuitive mind speaks by sending a picture, symbol, or image.  If you think you can never see or picture anything, you're mistaken. You just don't know how.  Your challenge is to strengthen the pictures and images you receive so you can consistently gain access to the solutions your intuitive mind presents.  There are constant opportunities to activate your imagination and strengthen the intuitive mind. Practice helps you  become more attuned to receiving its images. Before attending a meeting, close your eyes and picture the room.  How many people are attending? What is the mix of males and females? What is the mood in the room? If you have trouble creating imagery, first elicit the memory of a recent meeting, and then you can "switch the screen" to future mode.  Using your mind to visualize, "see" where your company is now and "see" or "sense" where it will be in five years.  Try to picture any dilemma in your company and use your intuition to play out the possibilities for a resolution.  Don't ignore daydreams and fleeting reveries -- these pictures, symbols, and images sent by the intuitive mind contain priceless nuggets of wisdom.
</ul>
<p>
The value of intuition is becoming more and more apparent, gaining respect as the silent but vital partner in any decision-making process. It is no longer a well-kept secret as successful business people attest that intuition is increasly acknowledged as a strategic business tool for the 21st century.

<p>
<font size="+1">Welcome To Tomorrow&reg. This slogan of Subliminal Dynamics&reg carries great meaning to the people who have experienced this unique process.  We are "earth shakers" and "ground breakers".  As our technologies carry us forward into the future, we must enlist a new paradigm of thought:  that we
truly are limitless beings.
<p>
Subliminal Dynamics&reg had its mundane beginnings and initial breakthroughs in 1975 in Phoenix,
Arizona. There, a retired financial planning executive strolled out of the desert and into history making.  With extended research in speed-reading, Richard Welch discovered a new brain process:  Subliminal
Photography&reg.
<p>
Richard Welch funded the research for Subliminal Dynamics&reg and protected it with a "trade secret". 
Independent psychologists from Arizona State University and the Stanford Research Institute were
involved in the research in the mid to late 1970's.
<p>
Subliminal Dynamics&reg statistics show that people, from ages 5 to 93, with I.Q.'s ranging from 58 to
genius, and learning disabilities including Dyslexia and Attention Deficit Disorder have been successful
using the process.  People from all backgrounds, i.e., Holistic Health Practitioners, the Medical
community, students, business and industry, education, professionals, law enforcement, military,
scientists, and others, have experienced the course and endorse it.  The Subliminal Dynamics&reg 
course is also included in the 1994 book, <font size="+1"><b><i>The Learning Revolution</i></b></font>, a best-seller in New Zealand, Australia, and Europe.
<p>
Our conscious mind is smart; it has the ability to think about things, thus, it also has the ability to
procrastinate.  In the <b><i>American Psychologist Journal</i></b>, June 1992, representing the 25th International Congress of Psychology, it has been levied that the "subconscious" or "unconscious" is dumb. Therefore, the subconscious does not think about things, thus, does not procrastinate.  It does, however, have the ability to process information at extremely high rates of speed.  This wonderful mechanism is fully programmable.  Many have compared it to the personal computers what we have become so accustomed to.  The point is: The subconscious does not procrastinate, it just does. It does what it is programmed to do.
<p>
In a study conducted in 1988, by Pawel Lewicki of the University of Tulsa, the subconscious not only demonstrates the ability to process information, but can also learn by patterning the information input.  Even though the people could demonstrate high proficiency in this testing, they could not explain how they accomplished it on a conscious level. This is intuition.  Intuition is finding a correct solution to a problem without consciously knowing the steps in between.  This occurs through subconscious processing of all the information expediently.
<p>
A research article in <b><i>Advances, The Journal of Mind-Body Health</i></b>, Vol. 9 No. 1, written by Henry L. Bennett, titled "The Mind During Surgery:  The Uncertain Effects of Anesthesia", discusses learning while under anesthesia without conscious recall.  These studies have concluded that when a post-operative surgery patient cannot remember anything from the surgery, it is not sufficient to conclude that nothing is permanently implanted in the mind from operating room conversations.  These conversations that do exist in the operating room can have very beneficial or very detrimental effects on the recovery of the patient.  Research studies show when positive therapeutic messages about health and recovery are used with the  patient under anesthesia, it is profoundly affective.  This leads to improved recovery, reduced postoperative stays, and less need for pain medication.  The patient has no conscious memory of any of the subconscious programming.  This information has started a very positive trend in hospitals and clinics around the nation.  Unfortunately, the majority of hospitals still do not update their treatment even though studies, conducted by David Cheek and Bernard Levinson in the late 1950's, indicated that a problem existed.  Their studies site the authoritative figures in the operating room making comments that led to mental problems of the postoperative patients.
<p>
In <b><i>Life</i></b> magazine, July 1994, the feature article is "Brain Calisthenics:  How you can think faster, improve your memory, and defend against Alzheimer's Disease".  This article discusses the application of "whole brain learning" to stimulate the growth of dendrites in your brain cells.  The dendrites are the memory storage compartments of the brain.  This in turn will give you more memory capacity and the ability to remember more things, past and present.  The article falls short by only giving very vague methods of "whole brain learning".
<p>
The Subliminal Dynamics&reg process is a very advanced system of whole brain learning that is taught in the U.S.A., Canada, New Zealand, Europe, Singapore and Malaysia.  By incorporating synergistically several tools including Subliminal Photography&reg  and Educational Kinesiology, the Subliminal Dynamics&reg process stimulates an accelerated dendritic growth.
<p>
Subliminal Photography&reg is the primary vehicle that expediently creates a very strong rapport between the conscious and the subconscious.  It opens many doors to our vast potential by building these bridges.  As a learning tool, it allows people to assimilate information at 100 times the average reading speed with 100% retention for life. But, this is not limited to learning. More importantly, it opens a pathway to a part of the brain that has fantastic abilities.  This part of the brain acts as a conduit to universal energies and controls many autonomic functions such as heart rate, breathing, etc. Countless applications have been discovered. This gives you the tools to take control of your life like never before.
<p>
Many Subliminal Dynamics&reg students claimed when using the Subliminal Dynamics  process and applying it to their health issues, it provided healing of bones, tissue, organs, and cures or remissions of diseases and decrease in stress.  Authorities, such as Deepak Chopra, M.D., are coming forward to educate the populace about the effects of stress in our culture.  Simply put: stress propagates disease.  A major factor of increasing stress is information overload -- as Rutherford D. Rogers stated, "We're drowning in information and starving for knowledge."  To get a conceptual understanding of what information overload symbolizes, there are approximately 1,000,000 books published every year globally.  This does not include periodicals or other documents.  To read 1,000,000 books in one year would be 2740 books per day; 114 books per hour; or approximately 2 books per minute. Bon appetit!
<p>
As the information revolution is fully realized by the information capacities of the newest computers, the next step must be the "Mental Revolution<font size="1">sm</font>". Simply to keep up is not good enough anymore.  Only by getting back to assimilating information as a small child would, can we ever hope to hold our own in today's fast paced market.  By achieving this with the Subliminal Dynamics&reg process, we can take a sufficient chunk out of the stress we must endure.  By strengthening and toning the brain in this natural way, we can create a better, healthier, and happier life.<br>

<font size="+1">Imagine sitting down with a book and Mentally Photographing&reg its contents as fast as you can turn the page and then enjoy near perfect comprehension and permanent recall of the material. This is just one application of the Subliminal Dynamics&reg technology.  Subliminal Dynamics&reg, a system of training in mind development, shatters conceptions of how we learn and our capacity to master great quantities of information.
<p>
Through Subliminal Photography&reg we are able to bypass the conscious mind and access directly that part and function of the mind that has enormous capabilities and potential; the 90% that can store, retain, and recall vast quantities of information permanently. Ironically, being able to turn pages fast enough seems to be one of the biggest impediments to students of this technique.  It would not be unusual for a student to test at 85% comprehension at 20, 30, even 40,000 words per minute or better!
<p>
The story began 21 years ago when company founder and developer, Richard Welch, bought and operated a speed-reading business.  A known phenomenon of the speed-reading training was that the faster one processed written information, the better the reader understood the material and the recall and retention of the material improved radically.  However, Welch discovered that many "speed-readers" did not continue to improve in their reading skills and recall of learned material was not permanent.  Richard Welch went beyond the limitations of speed-reading and developed a technique known as Subliminal Photography&reg, the keystone of the Subliminal Dynamics&reg training.
<p>
The people of Subliminal Dynamics&reg are quick to point out that this program should not be considered a course in photographic memory or speed-reading.  In fact, this process is quite unlike reading as you have known it.  This training is more a methodology by which you may enable brain functions that are uncommon in our everyday experience though nonetheless very accessible.  We have often heard it said that we typically only use a fraction of our brain's functional capabilities.  This method offers to show us the key to unlocking a capacity of mind that could prove to be an evolutionary step for mankind in our ability to learn and in our creativity.
<p>
The implications are astounding.  Not only does the technology greatly expand the functioning and utilization of the mind, it appears that the exercising of this mental functioning actually promotes brain
development via increased dendrite growth -- the nerve pathways and memory storehouses of the brain.  An article in <b><i>Life</i></b> magazine, from July 1994 titled "Brain Calisthenics", indicates that through a process known as "whole brain learning" dendrite growth is stimulated in brain cells.  The Subliminal Dynamics&reg technology is promoted as an advanced system of whole brain learning, essentially a technique by which whole brain functioning is activated with apparently spectacular benefits.  In fact, one of the most startling claims of this training is that it seems to bypass common handicaps to learning such as learning disabilities and even the poorest eyesight.
<p>
Subliminal Photography&reg is the primary vehicle that expediently creates a very strong rapport between the conscious and the subconscious.  It opens many doors to our vast potential by building these bridges.  As a learning tool, it allows people to assimilate information at 100 times the average reading speed with 100% retention for life.  More importantly, it opens a pathway to a part of our brain that has fantastic abilities.  This part of the brain acts as a conduit to universal energies and gives you the tools to take control of your life like never before.
<p>
The mind has no limits in its capacity to process and store information and there are methods by which we may access this potential.  In many ways the pressure of our age of information, part of the true new age we live in, compels us to reach for new tools of learning.  Just as the personal computer has transformed the ways in which we "keep up" and conduct our lives, so too technologies such as Subliminal Dynamics&reg may be just the ticket for a new age in personal evolution equal to the demands of a rapidly advancing technological world.<BR>

<font size="+3">READING FASTER THAN<BR>THE EYE CAN SEE</font>
<p>
<font size="2"><b><i>By Winnie Wilmarth</i></b><br>

<p>
<font size="+1">It's not often a completely new idea in education comes along.
<p>
"American education has spent a lot of time looking for better ways of doing what's been done for the past two hundred years," said Connie Simon, resource teacher for Kreft Elementary School. Certified to teach children who are mentally retarded or learning disabled, she says she "works with students for whom traditional methods are not always effective". The students she has worked with since she joined the Lewis Central School system in September have made encouraging progress.  Going from C's and D's to B's.  One student ran for a seat on Student Council and won, a real victory for a learning disabled student.
<p>
Simon is quick to point out that the students' progress is not due to her efforts alone.  The teachers
in the regular classrooms also work with the learning disabled as do family members. Simon says she gives her students plenty of positive messages, telling them that success is within their reach. In addition to the curriculum Simon is assigned to teach, she has used portions of a new method of learning she discovered a year ago to help her students.
<p>
Referred to as Subliminal Dynamics&reg by its developer, Richard Welch, the method teaches individuals to use their subconscious sift through and retain large quantities of material. "It's not a new way to learn; it's a way to learn," Welch says.  "By using the subconscious, a person can learn from 50 to 100 times the normal rate." One of the biggest advantages the program has for Simon's students is that the learning disability is bypassed.  People of all ages, education, and intelligence levels have been successful in learning the methods, according to Welch.
<p>
Welch, who has moved his headquarters to Omaha from Phoenix, bought a speed-reading company
in 1975 as a challenge.  The former financial planner found that the faster his clients read, the
greater their comprehension and retention.  The average person reads at a rate of 250 words per
minute, comprehending about 50 percent of the material.  About 90 percent of the material
understood by the average reader is lost after 48 hours, according to Welch. However impressive the speed attained by students, follow-up of the company's clients showed that they reverted to their old patterns of reading after three or four months.
<p>
"Learning the way we are taught in school, we keep reading until 'it sinks in'," Welch says.  "The question we need to ask, is 'Where does it sink to?'." He asked a similar question to speed-reading experts, including Evelyn Wood, in researching speed-reading.  As speed increases, the reader is consciously aware of fewer words.  According to Welch, fewer are "subvocalized," or formed mentally. Although most people have little confidence in their ability to retain material in the subconscious, that is where the real learning takes place.  It is also where 90 percent of our brain capacity is, according to Welch. "We're just barely beginning to understand our capabilities," Welch says.
<p>
Subliminal Dynamics&reg teaches people to bypass the spoken words and take in and recall learning on
the subconscious level by a method called Subliminal Photography&reg. Methods which have been tested at the Stanford Research Institute for four years, teach students to relax and flip the pages at the rate of two pages per second.  Thinking of a word or a question will trigger nearly total recall. "The biggest problem with the method is turning the pages fast enough," Welch says.  The 85 to 95 percent recall mostly limited to being able to photograph all the pages since turning them so fast results in turning several at a time.
<p>
"When you first experience Subliminal Photography&reg, you have no sensation of reading," he
says. Initial exercises include photographing a thesaurus and dictionary.  Exercises Welch recommends
daily include, use of eye drills, 15-minute relaxation sessions and a "distraction index," a method of
deep concentration developed by Albert Einstein, according to Welch.
<p>
Welch does not regard Subliminal Photography&reg as revolutionary. "There is nothing new here.  What we are doing is showing how you learn in the beginning - it's a recapturing of the ability we were born
with," Welch says. Welch speaks of the possibilities with an unassuming earnestness.  He is not out to make a fortune, he says.  He already made one in the financial planning business.  Apparently Welch is not seeking personal fame, either. Nor does Welch take credit for being the first to develop the basic techniques.  An educator taught and wrote a book concerning subliminal learning in the late 1950's, but was dismissed as a charlatan. Welch realizes he too, may be ridiculed. However, he is motivated by a vision of what American society could be like if more people were able to tap unseen inner resources.
<p>
In the past, educators and parents have been intimidated by the idea that a child could earn a college
diploma by age 12.  "People ask, 'how will we put them into the workforce' ", Welch says.  "How
narrow.  They could get several doctorates by the age of 18 -- think of the contribution to society they
could make."
<p>
According to Welch, once people are able to draw on the resources of the subconscious, there
seems to be no limit to what they can obtain.  The 7,000 people who have enrolled in his course,
typically say they are more aware of things they could not see previously, including subliminal
advertising messages. Other benefits include a decreased need for sleep and an improved memory and ability to deal with stress, according to Subliminal Dynamics' brochures.
<p>
Welch is expanding the number of cities where the class will be taught to 50 by the end of the year. 
Believing that as more people are exposed to his methods, the educational system will be pressured
into taking them seriously, he is targeting major corporations.  Clients include New York Life and
U.S. West.  The class has been taught primarily on the West Coast.
<p>
Simon, whose own son has taken the complete course, says her personal benefits have been
tremendous.  In addition to reading faster and comprehending more, she now has more self
confidence. "It gets people excited about themselves and their potential," she says.  "When people realize
they use only 10 percent of their brain power, they start to see the possibilities in life if they
are willing to go for it."
<p>
Although cautious about both implementing the subliminal photography in her class and
attributing the progress students working under have made, Simon gives the highest praise to Welch.
<p>
"It's just a little early," Simon says.  "He probably doesn't realize what an educational pioneer he
really is."<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">Five years ago when I purchased my first computer system, I couldn't persuade my laser
printer to print postcards.  Envelopes and letterheads worked fine, but for some reason it refused to print postcards.  I read all the manuals on the printer and the software that were available and could not find a reason why postcards were rejected.  I even called the head programmer of the software who himself didn't know the answer and promised me he would brainstorm my problem with other programmers and possibly arrive at a solution.  Bear in mind, I didn't have training or prior knowledge of the workings of a computer system.
<p>
The next morning, in the shower, the solution to the problem came to me in a brilliant flash!  All I had to do was type a command stream into the software that would fool the printer into believing that the post card was really just an ordinary sheet of paper.  I couldn't wait to get to the office.  I typed in the commands and it worked the first time!  Thereafter, the shower became one of the greatest places for the reception of great ideas.  What I couldn't figure out is why the ideas came then.  What did I do to prompt my mind to reach these brilliant conclusions?
<p>
The quest for an answer to that question caused me to read numerous books on psychology and brain power.  The books reminded me that the subconscious mind continues to process information through the night and will give one a conclusion provided it has been given that task. There must be a technology, I thought, that one can use to program one's mind to continually work on the immense mental tasks that our conscious mind would normally find overwhelming.
<p>
The answer came recently when a friend of mine called to tell me about a man named Richard Welch who developed a technology called Subliminal Photography&reg. His company, Subliminal Dynamics&reg, is based in Aurora, Colorado.  Mr. Welch and an army of instructors are now teaching this technology in the United States, Canada, and other foreign countries.  Mr. Welch explained that the mind, through the eyes and other senses, takes in millions of bits of information continually and is consistently in the process of evaluating that information.  Some of the information it brings to our conscious attention immediately, as in the case of a plate we're holding that's too hot and may burn us.  Other data it evaluates and helps us reach conclusions.  For example, have you ever talked to a person who, on the surface, seems genuine, sincere and looks you in the eye with confidence, but your guts were telling you that the person was lying to you?  Your conscious mind may reprimand your gut feeling by saying 'this is a attractive person, they don't seem incongruent in their actions, they can't be lying.'  Could it be that our subconscious mind had reached a conclusion about that person based on the data it was receiving?  It may have been imperceptible to the
conscious mind, a twitch, a slightly higher pitch in their voice, nervous gestures or body movements. All of that accumulated data caused your mind to reach a conclusion -- and it was probably correct.
<p>
The same inner mind is called a servo-mechanism by Dr. Maxwell Maltz in his book, <b><i>Psycho-Cybernetics</i></b>, published in 1960.  He contended that the inner mind is a brilliant servant whose sole purpose is the performance of tasks assigned to it by the conscious mind. This combination makes man a goal-striving organism who finds fulfillment in pursuing and overcoming challenges.  What Dr. Maltz and Mr. Welch both concluded that we clearly underestimate the abilities of the mind.
<p>
For example, Mr. Welch privately funded research into the capabilities of the mind in the mid-1970's.  He discovered that while the average reading speed was approximately 250 words per minute, speed-reading could possibly increase the speed up to a few thousand words per minute.  The faster a person could speed-read, the greater their comprehension levels and retention levels.  This may counter popular belief that a person must read slowly and methodically to maximize retention.  The mistake in this thinking is the assumption that the brain is limited to the amount of information it can receive -- not so, according to Mr. Welch's studies.  Mr. Welch was able to get his test subjects to easily consume 25,000+ words per minute.  By using a tachistoscope, a device that flashes book pages on a screen at the rate on one every 40 milliseconds, test subjects could consume in excess of 2,000,000 words per minute!  Can one's brain retain that amount of information? 
<p>
Amazingly, the answer is "yes."  When tested on the material, subjects would regularly score in the 70 to 90 percentile range.  The reason this works, according to Mr. Welch, is that if the technology he developed is followed, a specific part of the brain is accessed which in effect is long-term memory. The information taken in by-passes the conscious mind and goes directly to the mind's storage tanks. Thereafter, it is a matter of being able to reach into the storage area and retrieve information as needed.  This requires an education in accessing techniques.
<p>
It is difficult for the conscious mind to conceive of accessing such large amounts of information and of the ability to retain it in long term memory indefinitely.  After all, since we were five years of age, our schooling system taught us that to remember anything we must use slow, methodical repetition.  Sending information directly to long-term memory, by-passing conscious thinking almost smacks of educational heresy.
<p>
Mr. Welch is not alone in his discovery of this amazing part of our mind.  A research study conducted at Towson State University in Towson, Maryland, in 1977, reported by Christina Selway, Mark Jacobson and Frederick Parente into the area of eidetic imagery, or "photographic memory" as it's commonly known, concluded that eidetic memory is a large capacity to store detailed and colorful images that are retained by the individual for long periods of time.  The evidence they found suggested that eidetic imagery is maintained in the adult population as a little used memory store that may be accessible to most everyone in certain conditions.  However, it was clear that the subjects had to believe in their eidetic ability to maximize their performance.  The study concluded that eidetic imagery can be learned.  The use of eidetic memory in the adult years is probably a matter of practicing the use of a memory strategy rather than the possession of a unique ability by just some.
<p>
Indeed, prior to our attending elementary school, from the date of birth, we used what Mr. Welch calls Subliminal Photography&reg, to learn everything we needed to become societally functional. Some children learn several languages, how to walk, to recite books and movies verbatim, and even to manipulate adults to get what they desire, all in just five years!  This is accomplished, according to Mr. Welch, though the direct access to long-term memory by the child, using a natural innate whole-brain learning ability.  This direct link to stored information diminishes as the rote-memorization of schooling suppresses this inherent talent.
<p>
Mr. Welch simply contends that a person can regain that valuable talent.  The same amazing learning abilities a child has can be reawakened in us as adults!  Think of what that could mean to us. Suppose we developed cancer in our body and were given several options of treatment.  Which treatment do we choose, especially if we haven't studied the disease?  Our life depends upon that decision.  In the past, we would credulously leave that decision to our physicians.  Now in addition to listening to the recommendations of our physicians, imagine being able to go to the library, Mentally Photograph&reg every piece of information ever written about our particular disease, have our subconscious analyze that information and, with the help of our physician, reach the conclusion that's in our highest interests?  This is only one of the scenarios that has become a reality for thousands of people who have been exposed to Subliminal Dynamics&reg technology, including myself.
<p>
I attended Mr. Welch's Subliminal Dynamics&reg course.  There, I learned how to take a 300 page book and send it directly to long-term memory in less than five minutes!  I was amazed that when I was tested on the information, I scored 70-85% on the exams.  In the weeks after the course, I photographed my entire reading pile and most of my library of books at home.  This is the first time in my life where I have been completely caught up on all my reading including all trade journals, correspondence, etc.  I have mentally ingested reference materials, fiction and non-fiction novels, life stories, the Bible, and even dictionaries.  I am amazed at what ideas, thoughts, and words come out of my mouth.  Words that normally were not in my vocabulary, I am now using correctly!  Large, complex ideas are now coming to me that previously were not available.  Indeed, I've discovered that a person's entire level of thinking grows exponentially when one feeds the mind large doses of input. I've spoken to some of the 15,000+ students that have been exposed to the Subliminal Dynamics&reg technology and their reaction to what they have learned is very similar to mine.
<p>
There isn't any danger we will overload our mind.  The amazing brain makes more connections between brain cells to compensate for your increased information input, according to a recent Bristol-Myers Squibb symposium titled <b><i>"Brain Plasticity:  A Lifespan Perspective".</i></b> They concluded, as reported by USA Today that having more connections per brain cell allows for more information to be processed, enhancing mental function.  As you age, brain cell connections can diminish.  Having a greater number of connections per brain cell means that there are more connections as a whole, so the connections that are lost to normal aging are therefore a smaller percentage of your brain's capacity. Thus, you have further to go before crossing a threshold of loss and succumbing to age-related dementia such as Alzheimer's disease.  Hence the question, are we feeding our brain enough information-type food?
<p>
Many of us may answer "no" as the rigor of daily life leaves us little time for deep study.  For those of us that do read regularly, one book per month or even one per week, may not be enough to keep up with large amounts of data now available to us.  A technology that allows us access to vast amounts of information quickly is the crucial technology for the 1990's.  Without this ability, it will be difficult for any person, business or nation, for that matter, to keep up with rapid revolutionary technological changes we are seeing each year.  Every aspect of life is changing at a pace never before seen in history.  Picture a system whereby information to children can be stepped up dramatically. This could have massive impact upon what type of adults today become.  It would minimize boredom at school and lessen the child's desire to participate in errant behavior due to a lack of focus.  It could possibly move college information to grade school levels and allow colleges to spend less time bringing students up to speed, to focus their direct brain power to resolve current issues troubling mankind.
<p>
Further, studies conducted by Mr. Welch indicate that most learning disabilities such as dyslexia and even what some call "mental retardation" are conscious level disabilities.  For the most part, the subconscious mind in these people is intact and functioning normally.  Since Subliminal Photography&reg is a function of the subconscious mind, individuals who were tested with learning disabilities (even some considered legally blind) can access data off the printed page with high level of recall and retention.  While this may sound unbelievable, consider L. Weiskrantz's discovery in an article <b><i>Blindsight</i></b> (1986 New York:  Oxford University Press) where cortically blind patients were studied.  The patients reported no relevant conscious visual experiences for objects when they were required to make forced-choice decisions.  So, high levels of learning need not to be the privilege of a select segment of humanity.  It is possible to raise the so-called "I.Q." of the large majority of mankind efficiently.
<p>
To get there, we need to take the first step.  We must learn and exercise this mental technology to reach higher levels of learning.  It is available today and easily accessible.  Once we learn how to efficiently tap into our vast storehouses of written knowledge, we must trust that our inner mind will work diligently to process this information and create effective solutions to the problems we are facing.  We must be courageous, unafraid to shift the learning methods we have used for decades and rise to a new, improved level of learning.  We must believe that higher learning levels are possible. 
<p>
Perhaps, someday, books may no longer be the method of choice by information hungry people (it's very tedious to turn pages fast enough).  Instead, we may have machines in the home and in schools like the tachistoscope that flashes information on a screen rapidly so a person can access all the known information on a topic and have a mental command of a particular subject.  Could there be a cable channel in the future that plays volumes of data on demand on any subject that you desire?  Perhaps, data at these new learning levels will be available through the "information highway" which is right around the corner.  These products will only be feasible if enough people are exposed to the Subliminal Dynamics&reg technology and demand information at these increased levels.
<p>
The real question we must each answer is "Are we satisfied with our current level of learning or will we be part of the new information revolution?"

That someday in the future the scientific community will have no alternative but to acknowledge the validity of proven scientific principles also has never really been in question.  The only questions have been how and when.  The answers to these questions are the topics of this article.</i></b>
<p>
Imagine training your mind to be able to absorb information at the rate of hundreds of thousands of words per minute -- and to retain 100% of it, always accessible, for the rest of your life!
<p>
Imagine being able to program your subconscious mind to exert influence over your environment, including your physical body, to the degree of being able to fulfill your wishes, your needs and even giving you the ability to achieve and maintain good health!
<p>
Imagine increasing your mind's sensitivity to being able to perceive more information through all of your senses -- with full recall!
<p>
Imagine being able to program your dreams to solve problems you may have or those yet to confront you!
<p>
Imagine being able to keep current on reading everything in your areas of interest and specialization -- after you have finished absorbing the books in your library you never had the time to read!
<p>
All of these exceedingly desirable capabilities are now accessible as the result of the inexorable determination of Richard Welch, Founder of Subliminal Dynamics&reg, who has spent millions of dollars and sixteen years of research and discovery stripping the layers of obscuring misinformation, misunderstanding and disbelief from the path of unfettered learning and personal fulfillment by learning how to open the door to the subconscious mind.
<p>
It all began in October 1975 when, after fifteen highly successful years in the life insurance and securities business plus one year of retirement at the age of thirty-four, Mr. Welch purchased the American Speed-Reading Academy of Phoenix, Arizona.
<p>
After operating the school for two months, Mr. Welch held a teaching staff meeting and informed them of his desire to innovate and improve their course.  He wanted a course which would consistently surpass the results being attained by the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics course and -- if possible -- in less time. Until that time, their course and his had been producing students with reading speeds of about 2,000 words per minute, theirs in seven weeks, his in ten weeks.
<p>
Within the first month thereafter some startling things began to take place in his classroom.  Several students went beyond 10,000 words per minute and a few exceeded 40,000 words per minute. The initial reaction was skepticism, but after another staff meeting, he decided to re-write the course outline and implement into the course the innovations which had appeared to contribute to the remarkable increase in reading speeds.
<p>
He formed three pilot classes, each containing ten students.  The class had students of varied ages and occupations.  Among the thirty people were a nine year old child and a seventy-two year old man. After ten weeks, the results were in and Richard Welch was astounded!  The average graduate had exceeded 40,000 words per minute and the average increase in rate of comprehension was 28%.  Several students had broken the existing world record in speed-reading, which researched to be 100,000 words per minute, with increased comprehension.  Two students, a sixteen year old boy and a thirty-five year old accountant, exceeded 175,000 words per minute and were still climbing.  The accountant, Bob Scott, decided to continue working with the method once a week to find his limit. 
<p>
A few weeks later, he peaked at an amazing <b>422,000 words per minute</b> and tested with 85% comprehension on completely foreign material.  Mr. Welch then was confident he had found an entirely new method of speed-reading, or something like speed-reading, that when taught, produced unbelievable results with virtually anyone.  He sent his speed-reading staff to libraries to read everything they could find on speed-reading, reading, the brain, and eye-brain coordination.  He also continued working and testing his new methods in the classroom.
<p>
Arizona State University Psychology Department staff performed independent tests funded by Mr. Welch.  Control groups from the campus and students provided by Mr. Welch were used in the testing.  These tests confirmed that anyone with average intelligence can learn to read at astounding speeds up to <b>2,000,000 words per minute</b> -- with increased comprehension.  This was achieved by flashing information at forty milliseconds on a Tachistoscope. Tests performed by the Phoenix elementary school district confirmed that young children, fourth and fifth grades, could rapidly grasp his method.  It raised their reading and vocabulary skills several years with only a few hours of using this method.
<p>
During research conducted from 1976 to 1978, Doctors Verle McBride and Herbert Otto was consulted.  Dr. McBride had experimented with high speed reading for twenty years and Dr. Otto, Director of the Human Potentialities Research Project for the National Center for Exploration of Human Potential, in La Jolla, California, confirmed the similarity to a Russian method which he monitored.  The results of his monitoring shown that in Russia the method was taught initially to two-year old children.  Even more astounding was his discovery that the research on what this method was mostly based on, was conducted by Georgi Lozanov, a Bulgarian scientist, and had been started eighteen years earlier.
<p>
By the time these children had reached five years of age, they were proficient in three languages and handled 600 math problems per day, 400 new spelling words per week and were wanting more!  Later monitoring by Dr. Otto showed these same students, after using the method for their pre-college schooling, had mastered forty languages, had the equivalent of forty college degrees, had I.Q. equivalents over 200 and memorized the entire Russian encyclopedia.  Their brains measured in a fashion similar to the measurement of Einstein's, and it was shown that these 18 year old students were using as much as 40% of their brain's potential.  Albert Einstein had used approximately 15% of his brain's potential while the average person uses about 10% of his brain's potential.  Dr. Otto said that a light form of relaxation would enhance our learning process because he had witnessed this done in Russia.
<p>
During 1978, Mr. Welch discovered that the course structure could be accelerated to twelve hours total classroom time during a consecutive four-day (three hours per day) intensive. Mr. Welch incorporated the Company under the name of International Speed-Reading Institute, Inc. in June 1978.
<p>
In 1979, after moving the Company to San Jose, California, Mr. Welch began more testing and research to find new applications for the process now known as Subliminal Dynamics&reg.  The speed-reading application was then re-named Subliminal Photography&reg, which more accurately described the phenomena.  Mr. Welch also coined the phrase "Welcome To Tomorrow"&reg.
<p>
As the testing continued, it became obvious that the part of the brain being applied had remarkable
abilities and it was primarily unexplored territory.  The method of Subliminal Dynamics&reg was then under a "trade secret" and put under lock and key for protection.
<p>
Currently well over 10,000 people have been taught this evolving process which achieved its present structure in 1984. I.Q.'s from retarded to genius and ages ranging from 5 to 92 have learned the process and have been tested. The success ratio is over 98%.  People from all walks of life, students, business and industry, education, professionals, law enforcement, military, scientists and others have been taught the method successfully.  Research continues and new innovative courses are being tested.
<p>
After being headquartered in other states, Mr. Welch is currently based in aurora, Colorado.  He and his fine staff are committed to instructing the most innovative methods of human potential development.  The goals of Subliminal Dynamics&reg include being represented in fifty U.S. cities within the next year and thereafter to enter foreign marketplaces.
<p>
The applications of the process are limitless and the implications are incredible.  To understand the operation of the process the most necessary thing to realize is that while the four day intensive provides you with all you need to know and have: a student guide with instructions, practice routines, information, examples, tests, test results, relaxing tapes and the future ability to take a refresher course at no cost, it does not provide the practice time which is necessary for this process to become second nature to us.
<p>
As it is with most skills, a substantial amount of practice is required to become proficient at the process.  Remember that the operative part of this process is accessing the subconscious and that is something for most people by maturity have lost.  Actually, it takes approximately six weeks of daily organized practice as specifically outlined in the course and in the instruction manual before the wide open easily demonstrative abilities manifest.  However, even during the course, the student is shown to have a surprising amount of natural skill at using the technique.
<p>
A very important part of this process is learning how to get into the "alpha" state of mind.  This very relaxed yet highly alert condition actually helps you to bypass your usually negative preoccupations to reach the impressionable subconscious. When your emotions and beliefs have switched from negative to positive, the subconscious may come forth with incredible support to supply you with endless ideas to achieve success, lift your emotional attitudes or provide helpful actions from others.  The course teaches how to get easily into "alpha".
<p>
While the emphasis is placed on rapid book absorption, there are other very important areas which are covered in the classroom some of which are referenced at the beginning of this article. This process brings much of the subconscious into accessibility as is the conscious mind.
<p>
Imagine becoming accustomed to approaching all challenges with more confidence, more information, a greater sense of awareness and, to a probable considerable degree, a higher intelligence.  Subliminal Dynamics used daily as a natural part of living might well grant these.
<p>
Imagine living in a civilization filled with people in the fashion made possible by Subliminal Dynamics.  The differences would be great and the possibilities, awesome.
<p>
One of the first priorities for Subliminal Dynamics&reg is to introduce this process into the schools at the earliest level.  All concepts of "gifted children" will have to be revised because all the children using this system will become "gifted".  It is likely that present "gifted" people have in their own way discovered and used this process to a greater or less degree.
<p>
The work of this committed researcher, Richard Welch, demands the recognition, acceptance and utilization of his work at a level deserving of a Nobel Prize.  Because there is no provision within the Nobel Prize process to recognize this level of discovery, this author will call in a future article for the foundation of such a World Awards Foundation which will acknowledge at least thirty areas of works all of which are important to the genuine progress of man, individually in all ways and of all mankind in the pursuit of its evolution to a state of being thought by many not to be achievable by man on earth.

<font size="+1">This program will allow YOU to have better access to the "do" function of your brain -- your Subconscious.  YOU will be building a very solid rapport between the Conscious and Subconscious parts of your brain.  This is done by bringing MENTALLY PHOTOGRAPHED&reg information from the Subconscious to the Conscious through strengthened neural pathways normally unused in traditional learning techniques.  By using these same strengthened neural pathways, YOU can program your LIFE for ease, success, health, wealth, . . . whatever YOU want!

<center><h3>G.A. Papandreou speech on 27 May 1996 at the old Parliament House, 
where a ceremony took place for the 50 year since the Holocaust and the 50th

  Children are not born with  prejudice. 
There is no genetic   factor that generates   intolerance. On a   playground, a child does not   differentiate the colour of his   playmate. Nor does that child
  choose to play only with   another child of the same religion. Nor has
  there ever been a child to say "I will only   play with you if you are Greek" or "I  won't play with you because you are   Greek". How is it then, that some children   grow up into adults with prejudice deeply   engraved in their conscience?  <p>
What is it   that happens as they grow that changes   their instinctive nature of open acceptance to  one of discriminating hatred? <br>
  The answer is found in their education.   From the parent, the school and through
  their education that is promoted today   through the web of the mass media. It
  comes from a school that does not teach a   value system based,  on tolerance of those   that are different from them; A school that   is consecrated in absolute truths, rote   repetition and without creative and critical    thought. Or from a school that does not   stimulate co-operation with each other and   collective efforts; a school which does have    as its educational goal richness of thought,
  cultural creation and something different.  <br>
  It also comes from a state that is not   sensitized enough to avoid negligent or
  inadvertent institutionalization of   discrimination, or even worse, one that
  intentionally creates barriers and   reinforces biases and distances between
  people and countries. It also comes from the mass media which ever so easily places name tags or draws conclusions, creating   stereotypes which sell in the news more   readily.  <br>
Why then, does a child transform   from a person who embraces all to one
  who is selectively biased? Because the child   is taught to do so. <br>
  Throughout world history, many groups of   people have suffered racial, ethnic or
  religious persecution and discrimination.    In this century alone there have been
annihilations of people in the most  barbaric of manner, genocide; Official and
unofficial, recognized and unrecognized,  and where mankind has done too little to
intervene or prevent. Since the beginning of civilization with all the advancements
that have been achieved, it is imponderable    and inexcusable to conceive that people   have not been able t resist and repel this    kind of barbarism. <br>
Colossal technological    progress, one of mankind's largest   accomplishments, took us to the moon,   and yet we have not been able to find the   means and method of peaceful co-existence,   respect for human rights and securing the
  most basic rules of human existence for all. <br>
  It is inexcusable that people have not been   able to overcome feelings of hate for their   neighbours. <br>
  One of the blackest pages in human history   was the Holocaust of World War II.
  Approximately eight million people were   systematically killed between 1939- 1945.   Between 5,5-6 million of them were   European Jews. Approximately three
  million were killed in killing centres, gas chambers and the like. Nearly  million and a half were killed in shooting operations,   and more than 600.000 in ghettos. This was    a genocide without precedent. It is in   commemoration of fifty years since this   black anniversary that we gather today, to   remember. To engrave in our conscience   that we must stop, a, parents, as schools,   and as states, we must stop allowing hatred   to be a governing force in our human   interrelations. <p>
  This unparalleled annihilations served as a catalyst, for the first time in history, for a conscious international effort to combat horrific types of discrimination of man against man. In 1945, the U.N. Charter stated  as one of its purposes to advocate
"respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for aIl without distinction to race, sex, language or religion". In 1948, the U.N. General Assembly passed the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  And in I976, UN covenants went into
effect regarding Civil and Political Rights. <br>
More specifically, the Covenant on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide,
as well as the Elimination of All Fonts of Racial Discrimination. These were positive steps, but not yet enough.  <br>
Following World War II and the shocking experience of genocide European nations
began the creation of what has today developed into what is known as the
European Union. The governments and people of Europe have tried to work
together over the past decades trying to  create a unique institution which could and  would deal more effectively, more    democratically, more humanely with the
  common problems faced by our people,   but also that of humankind. By combining   our forces, by sharing our resources, by    developing common law and principles   and by giving voice to the diversity of our    cultures and traditions, we hope to find a    new way for the future. <p>
  Europe, in fact, is in not simple a    geographical concept. It is a set of
  principles and practices which wll1 allow us    to establish a common foundation of    peace and co-operation, where previously,   in our father's and grandfather's
  generations, war, racism, anti-Semitism    and misery existed. Under this European
  edifice, we have tried to create a society    where the citizen  has a voice. Where he or    she has the right to work, to education, to    health care, and to a clean environment. <p>
A    society where the individual citizen can    participate in the actual creation and    construction of this future Europe through   non-governmental organisations. Under   this common European framework we   have tried, and continuously are tying, to   create a society where different cultures,
  religions and traditions can exist side by side and can be respected as to equal to
one another. In the recent Maastricht Treaty culture and education have
received important attention, while simultaneously community programs are
geared to enhance the knowledge of our different languages and the respect of our
various cultures-internal and external to Europe. <br> 
Moreover, we have tried to create a political community where different and formerly warring nations can live and cooperate peacefully and constructively together. <br>
For example, once arch enemies during World War II, France and Germany are now considered as two basic pillars of Europe's today and tomorrow. <br>
That is not to say that there are not problems. Within the European Union, as
within the wider European continent, we are witnessing increasing violence,
extreme nationalistic activities as well as neo-fascism. <br> 
Phenomena, such as ethnically clean states in the former Yugoslavia, and neo fascist parties rising in Western Europe, have brought on unthinkable suffering and brutality. <br> 
Undoubtedly this has marred the vision of a new multicultural Europe.
  There is still much to be understood and   done. Fanatic nationalism that was born
  with the fall of the Berlin Wall, is the   result of a sudden shift in the rules as we
  have known them for more than half of a century. Nationalism emerged when
  people, once part of powerful and over-powering alliances who took care of
their collective security needs, suddenly realized that they were on their own and
expected to develop fully independent identities. <br>
Nationalism came from extreme conditions of poverty, but no market of
democratic cultural structures in existence to help alleviate it. That is to say,
nationalistic fervour helped only to divert attention away from the pressing day-to-
day problems, by placing the burden and blame of the <others>,. It was the
inevitable offspring of d system which lacked an established democratic culture,
which furthermore, kept different ethnic groups united within their physical
boundaries, but did not afford to the people adequate democratic
representation and participation which  would, in turn, lead to their feeling
naturally integrated into these societies.<br>
What does this mean? That the legitimate needs of the people of Europe,
southeastern, central or eastern Europe, to define their own fate and solve daily)y
problems have repeatedly been frustrated.
The absence of a viable framework for participation and power sharing
transformed the very legitimate desire, for security, economic and social welfare,
religious worship and national pride into fanatic nationalism, racism, and ethnic
hatred. <p>
I personally believe, however, that these phenomena are the exception and not the
rule in our times. As I have said earlier, Europe has made a decision to fight these
problems in ways which will strengthen ;solidarity amongst different people and
iifferent nations. The political leadership of Europe has not only made strong
tatements to this)s effect, but it has shown decisive determination by implementing
strong, practical actions that sow seeds for future generations. <p>
We in Greece, having lived through similar tragedies in the past, or living today in the example of Cyprus. We give the utmost importance towards creating the necessary framework and support structures in order to avoid a replay of the terrible events that W.W. II brought upon us, or the recent  bloody wars in the former Yugoslavia, but also to be used  to rectify injustices that still
exist, such as Cyprus. We cannot but feel shame in knowing that the United Nations
and other non-governmental organisations continue, even tday, to make resolutions and take decisions against nations that insist on pursuing activities condemned by humankind. We believe in a more active and preemptive of all international bodies concerning the fate of people whose rights, individually, but also collectively, are constantly being violated. <br>
I am proud that Greece, true to the democratic values that we gave to
civilisation, did not falter during World War II. We fought and resisted fascist
racism - Nazism - and did so as one nation. Christians and Jews alike. <p>
Jews have been in Greece since ancient times. Following the inquisition of 1492
there was a mass  immigration of Jews from Spain. Most of these people settled in
Thessaloniki, a city known for welcoming refugees of all types. In the 20th century,
the Greek Jews had communities in different regions of Greece, especially in
the north and western regions of Greece, as well as in Attiki and the islands of the
Dodecanese and lonian. <br>
Christians and Jews lived in harmony. The scantily few episodes hat had ever taken
place were the result of local interests of extreme individuals, but never coming
from the popular base. The continuous contributions of Greek Jews to the
development of Hellenism andd the feelings of solidarity between Christians and Jews in the large cities as well as the country-side towns, manifested itself the fullest during the Holocaust crisis when Hitler's "Final Solution" began. <br> 
Ecclesiastical  figures, mayors, presidents of unions, professors and many more including the most important, the people, the simple anonymouscitizen, fought, with dangers to themselves and to their families, to save their Jewish neighbour and friend. <br>
The factors that changes these bystanders into activists was indeed an internal value
system which emphasised, their commonality rather than their differences.
They were human beings and they were Greeks. People, Jews and non-Jews
gathered together in secret to do  something. They gathered in universities,
in churches, hospitals, wherever they could in order to protect themselves as a nation of one. These efforts were taken b the multitude of "quiet heroes". <p>
I would like to take a moment  speak of the special contribution made by the Greek Church Archbishop Damaskinos, in making a historical Declaration, the only one in kind in the entire universe, co-signed by 29 representatives of the spiritual, scientific, commercial and artistic community of Greece, professed to the
Occupying authorities: <br>
"Today we are interested and deeply  concerned with the fate of 60.000 of our
fellow citizens, who are Jews. For long, we have lived together in slavery and in
freedom and we have come to know their feelings, their brotherly attitude, their
economic activity and what is even more important their irreproachable patriotism.
True witness of this is the great number of victims offered without regret andwithout hesitation by the Greek Jewish community on the altar of duty when our country was  in peril".<p> 
Furthermoreore, when the Nazi General Stroop threatened to shoot the Archbishop
because of his Declaration, Damaskinos answered with pride: "Greek Bishops,
general Stroop, are hanged, not shooted. <br>
Please, respect this tradition...".<p>
A similar stance was held by Metropolites throughout Greece. The Church's
institutions, as well as the human consciousness of our priests, is something
that moves us and makes us especially proud. It is also a tradition which, I am
pleased to say, continues and is recognised  even today. In a letter fromSir Sigmund Sternberg of the SternMerg Centre for  Judaism, to the London Times last April, he wrote: <br>
"There is little anti-Semitism or racism in Greece, and Greek Orthodox leaders are
receptive to the Idea of more contact between the faiths, as indeed are others"
(April 29, 1995). <p>
Sadly, despite the good intentions and despite the heroic struggle Greece lost
thousands of lives during World War ll. Approximately 50.000 of them were Greek
Jews alone who perished in concentrationcamps. 86% of this population was lost,
making the Greek Jews one of the largest single communities of Europe to be
annihilated. Lost lives is distressing  enough, but wars of hate make it even
harder to comprehend or to accept.<p> 
Following the liberation, even though their was still internal turnoil, the then Greek governments, which had a multitude of problems to face while trying to
reassemble the country, they still took care to help the Jews who were returning from  the concentration camps, the mountains of the Greek Resistance and their hideouts, by re-organizing their communities and  individual lives. <p>
The Greek state enacted pioneer laws for the organisations and reconstruction of
Jewish organisations and the protections and return of abandoned properties to the
victims of the Holocaust. <p>
I would like to mention the following
characteristic laws: <br>
While the actual existence of the Greek state was i jeopardy following the war,
the government passed the Compulsory Law 367 of 1945 regarding reorganisation
of the Jewish communities. <br>
Furthermore, the Royal Proclamation of March 1949, founded the Organization of Relief and Restoration of the Israelites of Greece. <br>
The act, however, that made Greece a pioneer in all of Europe was made for the
destroyed Jews. Based on the Compulsory Law 846 of 1946, the Greek state
abdicated its right to Jewish properties of those people who died during the
Holocaust and left no inheritors or relatives, and instead gave it all to the
Jewish community. <p>
The Central Jewish Council's ceremony today, is an indication of their recognition
and appreciation of what the Greek state has done. In this day and age, where any
recognition of effort is rare, let alone to hear a "thank you", it is especially heart-
warming. However, I must say that for me it is only self-evident that the Greek state behaved in the only manner any truly democratic nation could have. For this
state, there are only Greek citizens. There is no other category. The official Greek
position was born of the psychosynthesis of the Greek individual, who imbued with
democratic principles, has always been opposed to racism and religious discrimination. <p>
 Even today, the government for which I have the honour
to represent, continues to uphold these same principles. For this reason, our
unyielding efforts are to conform our laws with those of the United Nations and the  European Union, in areas of combating racism and defending human rights.
The president of Thessaloniki's Jewish community said a bitter truth on May 5th
1995 at a Holocaust memorial service held at the Monastitioton Synagogue in
Thessaloniki. He said that the commemoration of the Holocaust was not
something outmoded. Not only was it a time for remembering and honouring those
who perished, but it was also a time to reflect and to compare what is happening
in the world today with that of fifty years ago. He concluded that there was a "bitter feeling that no lesson was learned". <p>
We are also tying in this county to do whatever we can to bring about all the
necessary preconditions for the creations of an open society towards different
cultures. As such, we are promoting a multicultural education. We are reviewing
school books and revising them so that discriminating assertions will be expunged.
We are promoting a system based on critical and open thought processes. We
are also pursuing a Balkan project where history books of the Balkans will be
co-ordinated in such a way that inciting propaganda and biases will be eradicated.
Indeed, in these last fifty years, while nothing can meet the level of atrocity as to
that suffered by the European Jews, man is still capable of evil actions against man,
and more tragically man continues to be barbarous and ruthless to other men.
Discrimination and intolerance continue to exist through "hate-wars". <p>
Today, however, there is more hope than ever before because we understand better the nature and cause of this evil. Individuals, states and the international community
know the face of the enemy, and to know one's enemy is to conquer him. We are
closer to that victory than at any other time in history. There is still much to be
done. But parents and schools are changing. The state is changing. We are
aware. The international community works together, all in the hope that hate-
war itself will be annihilated. But we must not forget, we must always remember, that the first step is from within ourselves. If we can stop separating ourselves as
"them" and "as", then to paraphrase Hannah Senesh's words: when the night is
dark, this would be a particularly bright glimmer of hope, and it would light the
way for humanity.

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<P>
 
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>Ladies and Gentlemen,<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>Again allow me to convey a very warm welcome on
behalf of the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Constantinos Simitis.</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>I am very pleased to see old friends from the
IOC as well as to have met new ones.</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>I will repeat our Primeminister's,</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>it is my particular pleasure addressing you and
at the same time assuring you, that the Greek Government fully
supports and guarantees the undertaking of celebrating the 2004
Olympic Games in Athens, as Prime Minister Simitis himself assured
you yesterday, during your brief meeting.<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>Being a country that practices in full for more
than two thousand years the concept of democracy, Greece has always
attributed a profound respect to the values of liberty, peace,
brotherhood and co-operation among the nations of the world. In
this spirit we wholeheartedly endorse and promote the concept
of the modern Olympic Games.<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>It is worth noting that all modern societies support
and apply the traditions of our Classical Age and our democracy.
Parliamentary democracy, from its first steps at the time of the
issuing of the Magna Carta to its more systematic formulation
at the time of the American and French Revolutions, always had
the original Greek democracy as its model. And it is for this
reason that the greek word &quot;democracy&quot; remains eternal.
<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>It should be noted that our country, a full member
of the E.U. over the last fifteen years, experiences of course
a steady, peaceful and normal political life. Throughout this
period, two major parties came to power, succeeding one another,
guaranteeing the effectiveness of the parliamentary democratic
procedures. <BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>Greece is also a country with close relations
with the Balkan and Meditteranean States. Our geographic location
and historic experiences, guarantee this privileged relation.
<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>Greece's main objective in foreign policy, actually,
remains the reinforcement and stabilization of peace in the entire
region, within well established borders and taking full account
of existing International Treaties. In fact, Greece is playing
a crucial role as a stabilizing factor in our region's politics.
<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>Additionally, I would like to assure you that
we are determined to undertake the great responsibility of holding
the 2004 Olympic Games in a spirit of serious-minded realism,
social and political consensus. The numerous programs of infrastructure
and environmental projects already underway (elements of which
are going to be presented to you with more details by our specialists),
are one of the fundamental guarantees of a successful organisation
of the Games. Most of these projects were already conceived and
inaugurated in view of our previous candidacy of 1996, a fact
that puts us automatically way ahead of other candidate cities.</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>On the other hand, the time remaining until our
organization of the 2004 Olympic Games, guarantees that we have
ample of oppportunity to complete calmly the remaining ambitious
programs like the &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Attic&quot; Metro,
the new Athens Airport, several athletic installations and the
new Olympic Village, taking full advantage in this direction of
a number of existing and future European Union adequate funding
sources, already attributed to our country.<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>Furthermore, I can assure you personally, under
my capacity as Minister responsible for Greeks abroad, apart from
Minister of European Affairs, that the vast pool of human mainly,
but also meterial, resources of our brothers who live and prosper
in other countries around the world, is ready to contribute substantially
in this great effort, adding their experience in respective countries
already hosts in the past of such events, as well as their force
and willing spirit to our common noble and just effort.<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>As a conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen, let me
convey to you again the assurances of both the Greek government
and myself personally, that this enormous challenge of celebrating
the 2004 Olympic Games here in Athens, will be crowned with a
success worthy of both our own athletic and historic traditions,
and our current optimistic, fervent drive for progress, as a modern
dynamic society entering the next century with firmness and a
renewed strength.<BR>

<CENTER><B>Interview with CUMHURIYET
<BR>
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Question :</B>
<I>In your opinion, what is the source of the traditional animosity
 between Turkey and Greece ; Why do the two countries exhibit
such a behaviour, instead of &quot;sharing&quot; their common
interests ;<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G. A. Papandreou :</B>
I would say that I do not see any traditional animosity between
the two countries. Traditionally Greeks and Turks have always
had good personal relations. We have many things in common and,
furthemore, we have lived together, we understand each other's
culture. <BR>
<P>
There are certain pending issues in the
relations between the two countries. Maybe, in that sense, we
should be enemies. But I think, on the other hand, that we must
be friends. And, it is a very good question why we haven't been
able to address the issues in such a way that this friendship
could become a productive one, because there actually is a huge
field of potential cooperation between the two countries, in areas
such as tourism, trade, dealing with some of the modern problems
of, say, illegal immigration, drugs  and terrorism. We could also
work together for peace, for bringing stability to the region,
for creating the kind of regional development that Europe has
witnessed since the 2nd World War. In this context, there is one
simple thing that Greece asks for : respect for the rules of international
law. <BR>
<P>
Let me mention the recent crisis of the
Imia Islands. Questioning our  borders was an aggressive move
on the part of Turkey. If you think there is a sort of borders
dispute, well, there are legal ways to solve the issue, always
in accordance with international law. In this case, the competent
body one ought to resort to, is the  International Court of Justice
in the Hague. And I must emphasize that the borders were not drawn
arbitrarily. They were drawn by very specific treaties.<BR>
<P>
<B>Question :</B>
<I>Your father and the Prime Minister of Turkey Ozal, when they
met in Davos, had decided to discuss all issues  that concerned
the two countries. There was, however, no follow-up to that decision,
while all contacts were broken off. Why;<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G. A. Papandreou: </FONT></B>Well,
we have always been open to the discussion of issues such as tourism
and trade. We would never accept, however, to negotiate our sovereign
rights. Following the crisis at Imia, Turkey claimed rights on
Gavdos, an island which is south of Crete and very far from the
Turkish coast. <BR>
<P>
You know that according to the treaty
of Lausanne, islands situated beyond three miles off the Turkish
coast, except Imvros  and Tenedos, are part of the Greek territory.
The treaty contains a specific reference to Imvros and Tenedos.
All these must be respected. So, this is where the dialogue was
broken off. It was launched to discuss mutual interests,  but
during the process, it turned out to be claims on Greek sorereign
rights. <BR>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>
<I>The Greek Foreign Minister, Mr. Pangalos, has accused Turkey
of expansionist intenions for the Aegean. Do you honestly agree
with such charges ;<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G. A. Papandreou:</FONT></B>
I do not think it's a question of agreeing or  disagreeing with
what our Foreign Ministers are saying. I think it is a question
of how the Turkish behaviour is understood by Greece. If one a
fine day, a neighbouring country to Turkey suddenly claimed land
that has traditionally been Turkish how would the Turkish people
feel? Well, this is what one has to understand.<BR>
<P>
<B>Question :</B>
<I>You have refered to crises on Imia (&quot;Kardak&quot; in the
Turkish text) and Gavdos. Do you think that, as far as this specific
issue is concerned, the media and the press of both countries
played a serious role in   fomenting the crisis ; <BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G. A. Papandreou:</B>
I believe, that the media played a very important role in creating
a climate of hysteria on both sides. The media, of  course, are
free to make all kinds of media events. Both countries, however,
should  be particularly careful not to provoke war, war which
could in the end due to media events. We almost went to war on
this media event. <BR>
<P>
At times, the media plays a bad or a
good role. But, all governments are responsible for their behaviour.
If Turkey insists on keeping  the border question open that would
be a of continued daily instability in our relations. <BR>
<P>
If these issues are solved, at some time,
then Greece will become the staunchest supporter and ally, of
Turkey, when it comes to protecting its interests in the European
Union. The issues dividing us, however, must be previously settled.
We are two neighbouring countries, with common interests to protect
and benefit from. <BR>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>
<I>The Greek-Cypriot government is preparing Cyprus accession
to the European Union, as a full-fledged member. If this happens,
what, in your opinion, would be the climate between the two communities
 on the island ;</I> <BR>
<P>
<B>G. A. Papandreou:</B>
There are three possibilities. The first one would  be to solve
 the Cuprus problem before accession. The second would be to solve
the problem during entry  negotations. And the third possibility
would be to settle the issue after accession. Personally, of course,
I would prefer to see the problem solved before accession. The
Turkish-Cypriot Community will thus be able to participate in
the discussions for entry, together with the Greek-Cypriots. The
small, but important, Turkish-Cypriot Community will become part
of the European Union, creating a bridge between the European
Union and Turkey. <BR>
<P>
Furthermore, when Cyprus join the European
Union as a full-fledged member, the Turkish-Cypriot Community
will be able to reap all the benefits provided by the European
Union. It is therefore, imperative, to find the political will
necessary for solving the Cyprus issue. Is seems that Mr. Denktash
has built on Cyprus a small fortress that he doesn't want to give
up. <BR>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>
<I>Turkey has declared that, if Greek territorial waters are extended
to 12 miles, that would  constitute a &quot;casus bell&quot;.
Do you really believe that the Greek Government, any Greek Government,
intends to extend territorial waters to 12 miles ?<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G. A. Papandreou:</B>
As far as territorial waters are concerned there is a serious
misunderstanding on the part of Turkey. Turkey has not signed
the E.U. agreement on the Law of the Sea, signed by numerous other
countries. The agreement acknowledges the right of the signatory
countries to extend their territorial waters to 12 miles. Greece
has this right  on the basis of international law. <BR>
<P>
<B>Question:</B><I>You do know, however, that the Aegean has a peculiar  geographical
structure ?<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G. A. Papandreou:</B>
That's right, of course. The international Law of the Sea, however,
does make clear that any country extending its territorial waters
to 12 miles has absolutely  no right  to prevent ships from other
countries and especially neighboring ones, from sailing through
its waters. <BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Interview with HURRIYET<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Question:</B> <I>You have said that a life full of problems
cannot go on. What about settling issues with the present coalition
Government of Turkey ; What do you think ?<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G.A. Papadreou :</B> I do not wish to interfere in Turkey's
internal affairs. There is always a curiosity, however, as to
which policies a new Government in any country might pursue. There
are questions about this Government's stance with regard to foreign
policy, alliances and relations with neighboring countries. The
same curiosity  is exhibited by Europe and the North-Atlantic
Alliance. Greece is equally  curious. I am certain that, if Mr.
Erbakhan goes to Dublin, the European Union leaders will be very
attentive to what he has to say. <BR>

<P>
<B>Question :</B> <I>A few days ago, the Turkish foreign Minister,
Mrs Ciller, made a plea for dialogue for which your government
turned down. Why?<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G.A. Papadreou :</B> We have repeatedly tried the method of
dialogue. However the Turkish position was to raise territorial
claims  against Greece. If I knocked on your door and said that
one of your things belonged to me, would you be willing to  accept
any kind of dialogue on the matter ; Greek territory is not open
to discussion. <BR>

<P>
If you have some kind of problem, you go to court. If the Court
grants  your request, we shall abide by its decision. <BR>

<P>
<B>Question :</B> <I>Until now, our  co-existence has been loaded
with problems. Can this go on ? <BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G.A. Papadreou :</B>  I believe that developing of our relations
is an indispensable condition. To this day, however, Greece is
really not to blame for the problems. What we ask is very simple
: respect for the rules of international law  and for mutual agreements
as well as a settlement of the Cyprus issue. <BR>

<P>
<B>Question : </B><I>You have always rejected Turkish proposals
on the Cyprus issue. Shouldn't you also make concessions, with
an eye to reaching a middle of the road solution ? <BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G.A. Papadreou :</B> There is no concession to make. The one
and only serious problem is that of the continental shelf. At
the time, the treaty  of Lausanne was signed, it was impossible,
from a purely technical  point  of view, to draw the border lines
 of the continental shelf. So, this specific issue remained unclear.
The first step should be a negotiation between the legal experts
of the two sides. The conclusion reached is them taken to the
International  Court of Justice for finalisation. <BR>

<P>
<B>Question :</B> <I>Greece keeps &quot;blocking&quot; Turkish
relations with  the European Union. How long do you think this
can go on</I> ? <BR>

<P>
<B>G.A. Papandreou :</B> We do not block  the relations of Turkey
with the European Union. You should bear in mind that the European
Union member-countries are becoming increasingly critical of Turkey.
On the Imia issue (Kardak in the Turkish text) the European Union
member-states adopted the same stance as Greece. Turkey maintains
troops on Cyprus. It does not abide by its obligations as far
as human rights are concerned. It is not Greece that places stumbling-blocks
in the course of European Union - Turkish relations. <BR>

<P>
<B>Question :</B> <I>Turkey adheres to its obligations within
the framework  of the Customs Union. Greece however, blocks economic
assistance and this prevents, the European Union from fulfilling
its promises. <BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G.A. Papadreou :</B> This is partly right. Still, Turkey has
not fulfilled its obligations either. It has not harmonized its
legislation neither has it kept its promises for democratization.
As if these were not enough,  it added a border dispute  to the
list. It is believed by some that Greece   does not want Turkey
to join the European Union. This is wrong. When the existing problems
are solved, we shall be the strongest supporters of Turkish accession
to the European Union, because Greece stands to benefit a great
deal from Turkey's full European Union membership. <BR>

<P>
<B>Question :</B> <I>What would such benefits be ? <BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G.A. Papadreou :</B> We share many common interests. We have
common economic interests. If we work together to bring stability
in the region, we could also create the proper climate for solving
other regional problems. First and foremost, however, we must
solve the  problems between us. <BR>

<P>
<B>Question :</B> <I>Turkish relations are used by Greece for
domestic consumption. What would you say to this matter ?<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G.A. Papadreou :</B> This is exactly why the interview with
your newspaper is so important. It offers Turkish public opinion
the opportunity to hear the Greek positions from the mouth of
a Minister. Turkish politicians should also give interviews to
Greek newspapers and present the positions of Turkey. Public opinion
in both countries will thus be given the opportunity to judge
the situation objectively. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Note :</B></U> In the introductory remarks of the interview,
the Turkish journalist points out that Mr. Papadreou expects Turkey
to make the first more towards solving the issues and that he
conveyed a political message by expressing his hope for solutions
to the problems between  the two countries.

<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
In the introductory note, it is stressed that Mr. Papandreou said:
&quot;In a program of a Turkish television  network, it was revealed
that &quot;Idealists&quot; (Gray wolves) burned precious forests
on Greek islands. I intend to ask from the Turkish Government
the immediate launching of an investigation:. <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B> <I>Contrary  to Mr. Pangalos, your stance towards
Turkey seems to be quite moderate. In this matter, are there conflicting
 opinions within your Government ; <BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G.A. Papandreou:</B> Our common position is that Turkey ought
to meet its responsibilities toward the European Union, so that
relations between the two countries could improve. <BR>

<P>
<B>Question: </B><I>Why does Greece place stumbling - block in
each phase of Turkey's accession negotiations with the European
Union; Why does it veto economic assistance to Turkey  by the
European Union;<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Mr. Papadreou:</B> Last June, the 15 European Union member
countries, and not only Greece, addressed a formal message to
Turkey: that it should meet its obligations, assumed in accordance
with the Customs Union  agreement. The crucial issue of human
rights is also one of the problems. The most sensitive issue,
however, is that of recognition of our borders by the Turkish
side. It surfaced with the crisis of Imia (Turkish text : Kardak).
For Greek public opinion, the Imia matter is not yet closed. We
wish Turkey did not attempt to settle the issue by brute force,
that it had used international law instead. Another factor is
the Cyprus issue. <BR>

<P>
<B>Question : </B><I>Do you think Turkey is part of Europe ;</I>
<BR>

<P>
<B>G.A.Papandreou :</B> In principle, yes. We do not oppose Turkey's
being part of Europe. <BR>

<P>
<B>Question : </B><I>Are you concerned by the Mr. Erbakhan's (fundamentalist)
Islamic identity ;<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>G.A. Papandreou :</B> Europe is not a Christian club. It is
a multi-cultural entity. At this very moment, there is a large
Muslim population in Europe. If the Cyprus issue is solved and
Cyprus join the European Union , the Muslims living on the island
will be represented within the Union. <BR>

<P>
<CENTER>published under the heading &quot;The Turks love him&quot;
<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>It is pointed out that :</B> <BR>

<P>
G.Papadreou is one of the few Greek politicians well-liked  by
the &quot;Turks&quot; of &quot;Western Thrace&quot;, the main
reason being that, during his tenure as Minister of Education
in the Government of A.Papandreou, he was actively involved with
the schooling problems  of the &quot;Turkish minority in Western
Thrace&quot;. He launched reforms in the minority's system of
education, and is also credited with school repairs and improvements
in the &quot;Turkish areas&quot;.

<CENTER>
<h3>THE MOST RECENT TURKISH ATROCITIES IN CYPRUS</h3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Background of the peaceful protest</B>
<P>
On August 2, 1996 a group of over one hundred Cypriot and European
motorcyclists set off from Berlin's Brandenbourg Gate on a long
and peaceful ride through many countries of Europe, heading to
Cyprus. Their stated aim was to draw the world's attention to
the Turkish occupation of part of the territory of Cyprus, the
artificial division of the island since 1974, and the violation
of human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Cyprus,
and in particular of their right to move freely throughout their
country.
<P>
The motorcyclists' rally was organized  by the Cyprus Motorcycle
Federation in collaboration with the European Federation of Motorcyclists.
<P>
<B>Turkey prepares for the atrocities</B>
<P>
On the day the planned demonstration was announced, the Turkish
side announced that it would be organizing &#171;counter rallies,&#187;
with the participation of the Turkish extremist &#171;Grey Wolves&#187;
group. It threatened that the Greek Cypriot and other demonstrators
would be fired upon if they proceeded with their demonstration.

<P>
According to Turkish press reports and other reliable information,
preparations for a violent reaction and organized violent counter
demonstrations began immediately. The aim was to fabricate the
impression that Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots cannot live
peacefully together, and therefore to support Turky's allegation
that the presence of the Turkish occupation troops on the island
is necessary:
<P>
The following preparative acts took place by the Turkish occupation
forces:
<UL>
<LI>&#171;Police&#187; in the Turkish occupied area were supplied
with automatic weapons and electric batons.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>More than 2,500 right-wing extremists belonging to the terrorist
Turkish organization &#171;Grey Wolves&#187; arrived in Cyprus
from Turkey threatening &#171;a special surprise package&#187;
against the demonstrators.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Turkish occupation troops in Cyprus were ordered to shoot
demonstrators attempting to enter into the occupied area. A high-ranking
Turkish commander was quoted as ordering his troops to &#171;break
the bones&#187; of Greek Cypriots who would ride into the occupied
area.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>At the same time, the Turkish occupation forces in Cyprus
deployed elite commando units, tanks, and armored personnel carriers,
and extensively mined the entire length of the cease-fire line.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Illegal settlers from Turkey were mobilized for mob-counterdemonstration
rallies.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>Consultations of the Government of Cyprus</B>
<P>
As the motorcyclists moved through Europe on their way to Cyprus,
they were joined by hundreds of European motorcyclists. Many more
were expecting them at Limassol Port for the final leg of the
journey.
<P>
Throughout this period, the Government of Cyprus and the competent
authorities were monitoring the developments and were in constant
consultation with UNFICYP.
<P>
They continued to receive alarming additional information on Turkish
intentions and preparations, including a possible advancement
of Turkish occupation troops into the buffer zone which is monitored
by UNFICYP.
<P>
Several meetings between the Government and the organizers of
the rally took place. Finally, on Sunday, August 11, the morning
of the day of the last stage of the rally, an urgent meeting was
held, under the chairmanship of the President of the Republic,
in which members of the government, high-ranking police officers,
as well as the president of the Cyprus Motorcycle Federation participated.
After a thorough and in-depth examination of the situation, as
it developed, and taking seriously into consideration the urgent
appeal of the U.N. Secretary-General, who expressed his grave
concern over the danger of violations of the cease-fire, it was
decided to cancel the final part of the rally.
<P>
The organizers of the rally agreed to this decision. At the same
time, however, individual motorcyclists and other civilians, acting
spontaneously, proceeded to various points along the buffer zone
and peacefully protested the violation by the Turkish occupation
troops of their right of freedom of movement throughout Cyprus.
<P>
<B>The first murder</B>
<P>
The reaction of the Turkish side was brutal and violent, resulting
in the death of a 24-year old demonstrator and the injury of 40
additional demonstrators. 
<P>
The Turks, in a premeditated and well-organized manner, brought
by bus thousands of so-called &#171;counter-demonstrators&#187;
to the cease-fire line under the control of the Turkish occupation
forces, and proceeded to lure Greek Cypriot demonstrators into
a conflict situation, subsequently using all and every form of
violence against them. The results of the attacks against the
unarmed and peaceful Greek Cypriot demonstrators, of unprecedented
cruelty and brutality, were witnessed by the whole world through
the international media present at the scene. Anastassios Isaac,
the 24-year-old Greek Cypriot, was caught in barbed wire and clubbed
and beaten to death by the so-called &#171;counter-demonstrators.&#187;
It is to be noted that the Turkish intent of luring the Greek
Cypriot demonstrators into conflict situations is simply demonstrated,
among other things, by the Turkish decision to use &#171;blue
beret&#187; troops, easily confused with U.N. troops, along the
cease-fire line.
<P>
The brutality with which an unarmed young demonstrator was beaten
to death, the firing by the Turkish forces at peaceful demonstrators
in the buffer zone, and the employment of terrorist groups from
Turkey to counter the demonstrators -- an act that constitutes
the introduction of terrorism with far-reaching consequences not
only for Cyprus but for the whole region -- constitute additional
proof of Turkey's contempt for all forms of civilized behavior
among nations and for international law.
<P>
<B>The &#171;Grey Wolves&#187; as described in the Turkish Cypriot
press itself</B>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot press confirmed the information concerning
the arrival at the occupied part of Cyprus of members of the extremist
terrorist Turkish organization code-named &#171;Grey Wolves.&#187;
Under the banner headline &#171;Grey Wolf Denktash,&#187; YENI
DUZEN (Aug. 13, 1996) wrote that those who arrived from various
parts of Turkey marched to Denktash's residence shouting racist
and fascist slogans. The newspaper confirms that they arrived
in the occupied areas using as an excuse the peaceful motorcyclists'
demonstration, and adds that they stirred up trouble and caused
the escalation of the incidents. It emphasizes that Denktash remarkably
&#171;thanked them&#187; for &#171;extending their support.&#187;
<P>
Similarly, ORTAM (Aug. 13, 1996) reports that Denktash, addressing
the &#171;Grey Wolves,&#187; unvailed a direct threat against
Cyprus: &#171;The Greek Cypriots should sit and think. Only part
of them [i.e., the Grey Wolves] came from Turkey. What shall we
do if the whole of Turkey comes?&#187; 
<P>
It is worth noting that the Grey Wolves have been accused of assassinating,
on July 6, 1996, the prominent Turkish Cypriot journalist Kutlu
Adali, because of his criticism of the Denktash regime and, more
generally, of Turkey's policies in Cyprus.
<P>
<B>The second murder</B>
<P>
On August 14, 1996, the international community witnessed with
shock the cold-blooded murder of a second Greek Cypriot by the
Turkish occupation forces, that of the 26-year-old Solomos Solomou.
Eleven more people sustained bullet wounds from indiscriminate
fire by Turkish troops. Some of the injured, including a 59-year-old
woman, were in serious condition. Two of those injured were members
of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus.
<P>
This new and premeditated murder took place under the following
circumstances: Following the funeral of Anastassios Isaac, a group
of 100-150 demonstrators broke through the Cypriot police force
lines and entered the buffer zone at the same point where the
deceased was beaten to death three days earlier. All those who
gathered in the buffer zone  were unarmed and peacefully protested
against the continuing occupation and violation of basic human
rights and fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots by Turkey, including
the murder of Isaac.
<P>
Despite the fact that the demonstrators were within the buffer
zone and were surrounded by members of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force,
Turkish troops, using automatic weapons, fired upon them.
<P>
<B>U.N. Reaction</B>
<P>
In a statement issued on August 14, 1996, the Secretary General
of the United Nations expresses his grave concern over the excessive
and indiscriminate use of force and the murders and injuries caused
by Turkish troops. Furthermore, the U.N. Secretary General's Representative
to Cyprus, Mr. Gustave Feissel, described as &#171;totally disproportionate&#187;
the violence used by Turkey during these incidents. Mr. Feissel
further stated that &#171;we felt that the shooting [of Solomos
Solomou] was totally unwarranted and inexcusable.&#187; He emphasized
that, although the Greek Cypriots had broken into the buffer zone,
the U.N. was in control of the situation and was in the process
of getting people out of the buffer zone when &#171;out of the
blue the Turkish soldiers started firing.&#187; He also stated
that UNFICYP was trying to take back Solomou when &#171;for no
reason whatsoever&#187; the shooting began.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
The Government of Greece condemns in the strongest possible way
the criminal behavior of the Turkish side and its puppet regime
in the occupied part of Cyprus, which has resulted in the cold-blooded
murders of two young and unarmed civilians within a period of
four days.
<P>
The Government of Greece calls upon all members of the international
community, both individually and collectively, to condemn categorically
these barbaric acts aimed at the people of Cyprus but also at
all civilized societies.
<P>
Furthermore, it reiterates its request for their active support
in seeking a just, viable, and lasting solution to the Cyprus
problem that will end the illegal Turkish occupation and restore
the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots.
<P>
The Government of Greece, finally, reiterates its belief that
the European Union, in view of its relations with Turkey, is in
a position to play an active and positive role in the solution
of the Cyprus problem and in securing Turkey's compliance with
the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus.

<TITLE>EXCERPTS FROM STATEMENT OF U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN NICHOLAS BURNS (August 16, 1996)
</TITLE>

<P>
<CENTER>
<h3>EXCERPTS FROM STATEMENT OF U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN
NICHOLAS BURNS (August 16, 1996)</h3>
</CENTER>
<P>
&quot;The United States expresses its deep concern over the recent
violence on Cyprus and our shock and sadness over the killing
of two Greek Cypriot civilians and the injuring of several other
persons, including two U.N. peacekeepers.
<P>
We particularly deplore the actions of the Turkish Cypriot security
forces in firing on protesters two days ago. The use of force
on this occasion, as well as during the original incident on Sunday,
was disproportionate to the threat posed by the protesters, notwithstanding
the then-unauthorized entry into the U.S. buffer zone.
<P>
The United States believes that those who were responsible for
these acts should be held accountable for them. We call on the
Turkish Cypriot security forces and the Turkish military forces
on Cyprus to adhere to internationally accepted norms and to avoid
the use of lethal force in non-life-threatening situations.
<P>
The United States also strongly urges both sides on Cyprus to
exercize restraint, to take steps immediately to reduce tensions
and to restrain unauthorized entry into the U.N. buffer zones.
<P>
The tragic events of the past few days underscore once again the
urgent need to reach a comprehensive settlement on Cyprus. The
United States will continue its current efforts to seek common
ground between the two communities and achieve a lasting agreement
on a bicommunal, bizonal federation that will enable all Cypriots
to live together at some point in the future, we hope, in a more
peaceful and prosperous Cyprus.&quot;
<P>
.....
<P>
<B>QUESTION:</B>  On your Cyprus statement, how worried are you
about Cyprus? ...
<P>
<B>MR. BURNS:</B>  David, the situation is very worrisome on Cyprus.
. . .  You know that the United Nations has issued a report on
the events of August 11, and you know that that report is quite
critical of the Turkish-Cypriot police who participated in the
fatal beating attack against the Greek Cypriot.
<P>
The U.N. says that these acts were deplorable. The United States
joins the United Nations in that assessment.
<P>
. . . .
<P>
Let me also say this. We know there are some comments by the Turkish
Foreign Minister, Mrs. Ciller, this morning about the sanctity
of flags. Well, the United States bows to no one in our respect
and deference for national flags. This is the sentiment shared
by countries all over the world.
<P>
But, frankly, protection of a flag cannot excuse the horrible
events of August 14. Human life and the sanctity of human life
are ultimately more important than protecting a piece of cloth.
<P>
The reaction of the Turkish Cypriot security forces was entirely
disproportional to the events.

<h3>DECLARATION OF THE PRESIDENCY ON BEHALF OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
ON THE RECENT VIOLENCE IN CYPRUS</h3>
</CENTER>
<P>
The European Union strongly deplores the recent violence in Cyprus
and the disproportionate use of force by the security forces in
the North of Cyprus in response to unauthorized entry into the
buffer zone. It condemns the brutal killings of Tassos Isaac and
Solomos Solomou and expresses its deep concern about the injuries
sustained by many others, including United Nations peacekeeping
personnel.
<P>
The European Union calls for restraint and calm in the wake of
these tragic events. It urges both sides to avoid further confrontation
and to cooperate fully with UNFICYP in its efforts to defuse tensions.
<P>
The recent events have again highlighted the urgent need to intensify
efforts to promote a comprehensive political settlement in Cyprus,
under the aegis of the United Nations. The European Union reiterates
its full support for the work of the Secretary-General and his
special representative in this regard.

<TITLE>DEMONSTRATIONS OF 11 AUGUST 1996</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<P>
<CENTER>
<h3>UNITED NATIONS REPORT</h3>
<h3>THE DEMONSTRATIONS
OF 11 AUGUST 1996</h3>
</CENTER>
<P>
The United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP)

has completed its review of the events surrounding the demonstrations

of Sunday, 11 August.  The facts that have emerged are as follows:


<OL>

<LI>On Sunday, 11 August, some 3,500

persons gathered at various locations in anticipation of proceeding

to Dherinia, the originally intended starting point for the demonstration

route. The demonstrators included some 120 motorcyclists from

12 countries who had arrived in Cyprus on 10 August, following

a journey which began in Berlin on 2 August.  During the weeks

leading up to the demonstration, UNFICYP liaised closely with

all relevant authorities to ensure that all necessary measures

be taken to prevent any violations of the United Nations buffer

zone.
<P>
<LI>On 10 August, the Secretary-General

issued a statement in which he expressed his concern at reports

that a Greek Cypriot motorcycle association was planning to violate

the cease-fire lines as well as the United Nations buffer zone

in Cyprus.  He expressed his hope that the organisers  of this

event would avoid a course of action that could only harm efforts

to resolve the long standing Cyprus problem.  The Secretary-General

also called on the Government of Cyprus to take effective measures,

in exercise of its responsibilities, to prevent any unauthorised

entry into the United Nations buffer zone.
<P>
<LI>In response to an appeal from President

Clerides early on Sunday morning, the President of the Cyprus

Motorcycle Federation agreed to cancel the planned demonstration

route and instead called on all participants to assemble in Makarios

Stadium in Nicosia.  Some 1,500 motorcyclists and associated motorists

proceeded to Makarios Stadium late on Sunday morning to hear the

message from their leader who also conveyed a message from President

Clerides.
<P>
<LI>Meanwhile, a major counter-demonstration

had been organised in north Nicosia of some 2,500 persons, including

a significant number of members of the Grey Wolves who had come

from Turkey.  This demonstration remained  peaceful.
<P>
<LI>Shortly before noon, the demonstrators
left the Makarios Stadium, split up into many groups, and began
to move around the city and beyond to various destinations that

were difficult to anticipate.  Groups of motorcyclists and persons

in cars assembled in various locations in Nicosia, notably the

Ledra Palace checkpoint, the United Nations Protected Area Foxtrot

Gate and the Presidential Palace.  These demonstrations remained

peaceful.
</OL>
<P>

The main incidents

<OL>

<LI>A group of some 150 Greek Cypriot


demonstrators, who were subsequently joined by another 200, arrived


at the United Nations buffer zone at the Old Famagusta Road at


about 12:40 hours.  The Cyprus Police (Cypol) lifted the National


Guard (NG) cease-fire barrier where the demonstrators quickly


proceeded into the United Nations buffer zone eventually right


up to the Turkish Forces (TF) cease-fire line, starting fires


as they went along.  UNFICYP troops in the area, subsequently


reinforced by elements of UNFICYP's Force Reserve, interposed


themselves between the demonstrators and the TF who were soon


joined by the Turkish Cypriot Police Element (TCPE) in riot gear.


 Although the situation became very tense, UNFICYP managed to


keep it under control, not least because the TF and TCPE acted


in a very disciplined and restrained manner despite considerable


verbal provocation from the demonstrators.  Cypol was not effective


in controlling the demonstrators who had arrived at that location.


 By 14:00 hours the crowd began to disperse and by 17:30 hours


all demonstrators had left the United Nations buffer zone.  There


were no casualties.
<P>

<LI>At about 12:00 hours, some 150 Turkish


Cypriot demonstrators appeared along the Sovereign Base Area (SBA)


at the link road near the junction with the Old Nicosia Road.


 At 13:30 hours, some 200 Greek Cypriot motorcyclists arrived


along with several TV crews.  The 12 SBA police deployed there


were unable to keep the situation under control and the two sides


began to throw stones at each other.  Some Greek Cypriots crossed


a few metres beyond the Turkish Forces<I> </I>Cease-fire line


and planted a Greek flag.  The Turkish Cypriot demonstrators responded


by firing shotguns at the Greek Cypriots who retreated and proceeded


to set fires.  By 15:00 hours, the Greek Cypriot motorcyclists


left the area and proceeded in the direction of Dhekelia.  According


to reports, 10 Greek Cypriot demonstrators were wounded, some


by shotgun pellets, as were 2 SBA policemen.

<P>

<LI>The most serious incident took place


in Dherinia.  On Sunday morning, a peaceful demonstration by some


250 Greek Cypriots took place.  They entered the United Nations


buffer zone and requested to deliver a petition to the Turkish


Cypriot checkpoint.  When the latter refused to receive the petition,


the demonstrators left the United Nations buffer zone, but remained


in the area.  At 14:30 hours, some 300 motorcyclists together


with some 700 persons in vehicles escorted by Cypol arrived at


the NG cease-fire line checkpoint in Dherinia.  Cypol deployed


along the NG cease-fire but left the checkpoint unattended, thus


enabling the demonstrators to enter the United Nations buffer


zone unimpeded.

<P>

<LI>In the meantime, the Turkish Forces


had allowed some 1,000 persons in buses to pass through their


3 km deep military zone and to assemble along the TF cease-fire


line, including persons carrying the flag of the Grey Wolves who


had come from Turkey.

<P>

<LI>The situation soon became violent,


after Greek Cypriot demonstrators entered the buffer zone and


approached the TF cease-fire line to provoke the TF, the TCPE


and demonstrators assembled there with verbal abuse and throwing


stones.  Cypol was not effective in controlling the Greek Cypriot


demonstrators.

<P>

<LI>At about 16:00 hours, the Turkish


Forces allowed the Turkish Cypriot demonstrators to enter the


United Nations buffer zone armed with bats and iron bars.  The


Turkish Cyprot demonstrators, joined by the Turkish Cypriot Police,


then proceeded to pursue the Greek Cypriots and mercilessly beat


all those who they were able to catch.  At the same time, there


was shooting, including by Turkish Cypriot police, from behind


the Turkish Forces cease-fire line towards the Greek Cypriot demonstrators.


<P>

<LI>During this period, a Greek Cypriot


demonstrator, Anastasios Isaak, was beaten to death by a number


of Turkish Cypriot demonstrators, including three Turkish Cypriot


policemen.  By 18:00 hours the situation began to calm down. 


In addition to the one dead, it was reported that some 54 Greek


Cypriots and 17 Turkish Cypriots were injured.  12 UNFICYP personnel


suffered injuries.

<P>
<LI>The UNFICYP investigation revealed
conclusively that the killing of Anastasios Isaak had occurred
some 50 metres from the scene shown on television in which three

Greek Cypriots were being severely beaten by Turkish Cypriot demonstrators

while helplessly entangled in barbed wire.  Two UNFICYP Irish

Civilian Police had done their best in trying to rescue Anastasios

Isaak at considerable personal risk.
<P>
<LI>The two United Nations Civilian Police
had observed two Greek Cypriot demonstrators being set upon by
two groups of Turkish Cypriot demonstrators who proceeded to beat
them with brutal force.  The two United Nations Police went to
the assistance of one of the Greek Cypriots (Isaak), and were
finally able to push aside the Turkish Cypriots, including three
Turkish Cypriot policemen, who were still beating him, it was
too late.  The location of the killing inside the United Nations
buffer zone was about 95 metres from the National Guard cease-fire
line and about 32 metres from the Turkish Forces cease-fire line.
<P>
<LI>A video broadcast on &quot;Euronews&quot;


<U>inter alia</U> clearly shows the killing of Anastasios Isaak


and the intervention of the two United Nations police.  The autopsy,


attended by UNFICYP, which was performed late afternoon of 13


August, revealed that Anastasios Isaak died of &quot;multiple


blunt trauma to the head&quot;.  UNFICYP has completed the collection


of the evidence at the scene of the crime and is in the process


of completing its investigation in cooperation with Cypol.
</OL>
<P>
<P>
The role of UNFICYP
Following the cancellation of the
original demonstration route, the Greek Cypriot demonstrators
broke up into numerous small groups with unknown destinations.
 As a result, there moves could not be anticipated, making it
difficult for UNFICYP to reinforce in advance the likely flashpoints.
 At the same time, UNFICYP had to place effective coverage at
all critical locations along the buffer zone while maintaining
minimum coverage in other areas.  UNFICYP's force reserve had
to be moved over considerable distances at short notice in order
to respond to fast developing situations.  Given the prevailing
situation on the ground as described above, UNFICYP's resources
were stretched to the extreme.

<h3>UNITED NATIONS PRESS RELEASE</h3>
<h3>THE DEMONSTRATION OF 14 AUGUST 1996</h3>
</CENTER>
<P>
 The United Nations in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has completed its review
of the events surrounding the demonstration of Wednesday, 14 August
1996. The facts that have emerged are as follows:
<P>
 On Wednesday 14 August, about 3,000 people and some 500 motorcyclists
attended in Paralimni the funeral of Anastasios Isaak who had
been killed by a group of Turkish Cypriots during the demonstrations
of 11 August.
<P>
 
<P>
 After the funeral service, at about 13:45 hrs, some 200 motorcyclists
and a number of vehicles arrived at the northern outskirts of
Dherinia, where members of Cypol had been stationed. As during
the events on Sunday, Cypol was not effective in preventing the
demonstrators from entering the United Nations Buffer Zone (UNBZ).
Some 150 Greek Cypriots passed the police line and outflanked
the UNFICYP troops deployed inside the UNBZ.
<P>
 As the Greek Cypriot demonstrators made their way into the UNBZ,
Turkish Forces and Turkish Cypriot military and police, which
until then had remained out of sight, deployed in full view and
in added  strength along the TF CFL. UNFICYP requested both Turkish
Forces and Turkish Cypriots military and police to exercise restraint
and not to overreact. It also reminded them that UNFICYP has sole
responsibility to deal with incursions into the buffer zone and
that there must be no interference.
<P>
 By 14:20 hours, some 200 Greek Cypriots were inside the UNBZ,
but UNFICYP was in control of the situation. The demonstrators
were being rounded up and moved out of the UNBZ . The main group
of Greek Cypriots were no closer than about 30 metres from the
Turkish Forces Cease-Fire Line (TF CFL).
<P>
 At about that time, a Greek Cypriot male, later identified as
Solomos Spyrou Solomou, broke free from the main group and ran
towards the Turkish Cypriot check point. He was chased by two
UNFICYP soldiers, who caught up with him at the guard post, but
the demonstrator broke free and began to climb a flag pole which
was flying the Turkish flag just inside the Turkish Cypriot check
point. The UNFICYP soldiers were pursuing him a few feet behind.
<P>
 Solomou was some 3 metres off the ground (less that a fourth
of the way to the top of the flag pole), when he was shot by a
Turkish Cypriot soldier and fell to the ground with blood flowing
profusely from his neck (the autopsy revealed that Solomou was
hit by five bullets). Turkish Cypriot soldiers then proceeded
to fire some 25 to 50 rounds indiscriminately into the crowd inside
the buffer zone. The whole incident was witnessed by the UNFICYP
Force Commander and the Commanding Officer of the Austrian Battalion
who were in the UNBZ some 35 metres from the TF CFL. They observed
uniformed Turkish Cypriot military personnel kneeling down and
firing in the direction of the demonstators inside the UNBZ.
<P>
 As a result of the indiscriminate shooting by Turkish Cypriot
soldiers, two British UNFICYP soldiers were shot from behind and
two Greek Cypriot civilians were also hit by gunfire. Three were
inside the buffer zone and one of the civilians, who sustained
a serious gun wound to the abdomen, was standing outside the UNBZ
close to the National Guard checkpoind. During the demonstration,
two Cypol officers and five Greek Cypriot civilians suffered non-gunshot
related injuries.
<P>
 The Force Commander of UNFICYP accompanied by the Chief of Staff
met with the Commander of the Turkish Forces in Cyprus late in
the afternoon of 14 August to stongly protest the totally unwarranted
use of force by Turkish or Turkish Cypriot military personnel
which resulted in the killing of Solomou and in injuries to two
peacekeepers and two civilians.

</ul>

Almost 22 years after the Turkish invasion and occupation of a significant part of Cyprus, which forcibly separated its people, the Cyprus problem remains unresolved. The end of the "cold war" marked the beginning of a new era in which respect and cooperation between nations, commitment to human rights, democracy and the rule of law are recognized as of capital importance.  
Within this new environment, the Cyprus problem is not only <b>an anachronism</b> in today's world but also <b>a factor of instability in the S.E. Mediterranean.</b> Hence, notwithstanding its moral obligation to contribute to a solution, the international community has an additional reason to show its readiness to contribute to the efforts for the solution of this problem.
<p>
<strong> A.  <a name="a">Geographical and historical background.</a> </strong>
<p>
Cyprus is situated at the north-eastern end of the East Mediterranean basin, 75 kms south of Turkey, 105 kms west of Syria, 380 kms north of Egypt and some 800kms south-east of mainland Greece. The nearest Greek islands, Rhodes and Carpathos are 380 kms to the west. Its population at the end of 1992 was 718.700. The distribution of its population by ethnic group is 80% Greek-Cypriots, 18,6% Turkish-Cypriots and 1,4% other minorities including Maronites, Armenians and Latins. The Turkish-Cypriots are the descendants of the soldiers of the Ottoman army that conquered the island in 1571 and the immigrants form Anatolia brought in by the Sultan's govenrment shortly thereafter.
<p>
The name of Cyprus has always been associated with Greek mythology and history and it is already to be found in Homer. The Greek element took root on the island with the arrival of the Achaeans between the 14th and 10th centuries b.C. Ever since, Cyprus has been an <b>integral part of the wider Greek area</b> and has gone through the same major historical phases as the rest of the Greek world:  city-states with rulers such as Evagoras, who often established themselves as outstanding figures of pan-hellenic range; participation in the campaigns of Alexander the Great; Hellenistic period under his successors; Roman conquest; Byzantine Empire. Of course, since that time, as was the case prior to it, the island, like the rest of Greece, changed hands ceaselessly and came under a series of conquerors: the Arab raids, the Franks and the Turks in 1571. 
<p>
Cyprus played an active part in the struggle for the liberation of the Greek nation. Despite the struggles and the desires of the entire Greek nation, Cyprus was not incorporated into the liberated and independent Greek state. No one, however, can deny her <b>Greek character</b> since neither the strong disadvantage of her geographical position nor the incessant raids and occupations, the introduction of foreign languages, religions and civilizations she underwent for centuries on end, were able to alter the religion, the civilization, the language and the Greek consciousness of her people. 
<p>
The ottoman period lasted until 1878 when the Turks ceded Cyprus to Britain. In 1914 the United Kingdom annexed the island, and in 1923 with the Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey unconditionally renounced any claim on Cyprus. British rule lasted until 1960 when, after a four year liberation struggle by the Greek Cypriots, Cyprus became independent and was proclaimed a Republic.
<p>
Cyprus became an <b>independent Republic</b> on 16 August 1960. The 1960 Constitution, imposed by the Zurich and London Agreements, divided the people of Cyprus into two communities on the basis of ethnic origin. The divisive and inflexible nature of the Constitution, which granted a wide-range veto power to the Turkish Cypriot community, representing only 18% of the total population, soon made the operation of the government difficult.   
The two communities were after a while locked into a <b>constitutional crisis</b> which became even more serious in November 1963, when Archbishop Makarios, first President of the Republic, suggested certain amendments to facilitate the smooth functioning of the State. Turkey rejected them before even the Turkish Cypriot community had a chance to examine these proposals. The Turkish Cypriot leadership fell in with Turkey's partitionist aims. 
<p>
Following Turkish threats to invade Cyprus, the Government of the Republic brought the matter before the United Nations. The U.N. Security Council resolution 186/1964 (the first in a series of U.N. resolutions to tackle the problem) provided for the stationing of a <b>U.N. Peace Keeping Force</b> (UNFICYP) on the island and initiated the U.N. mediating efforts to promote a peaceful solution and an agreed settlement in accordance with the Charter of the U.N.    
The Cyprus Government did all that was in its power to restore the situation to normality and in 1968 it began intercommunal talks with the Turkish Cypriot leaders for a negotiated agreement on a new constitutional system for Cyprus. Despite the support of Turkish Cypriot leadership to Turkey's partitionist objectives in Cyprus, some progress was achieved during these talks. However, they were interrupted abruptly by Turkey's invasion on the island.
<p>
<strong> B. <a name="b">The Turkish invasion.</a></strong>
<p>
In July 1974 the then ruling junta in Greece organized a coup d' tat against President Makarios which presented Turkey with the pretext she had long sought for. Alleging a right of  "intervention" as guarantor of the 1960 Constitution, Turkey invaded Cyprus on 20 July 1974 "to restore security and order and to protect the Turkish Cypriots". These assertions, however, cannot be sustained.
<p>
The right of "intervention" that is provided for by the treaties of Zurich-London does not necessarily involve the use of force. Even supposing that this were the case, the U.N. Charter explicitly excludes the use of force and is well-known that its provisions predominate over all possible international agreements to the contrary, as the Charter itself emphasizes.   
Apart from this, the Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash himself had at the time of the coup characterized the coup as an "internal affair" of the Greek-Cypriots, stressing that it did not affect the T/C community. <br>
Moreover, in cases of disruption of the constitutional order, the Treaty of Guarantee provided for consultations between the guarantor powers ( i.e. Turkey, Britain and Greece) and only if concerted action proved impossible did it reserve to each of the guarantor powers the right to act unilaterally with the exclusive aim to restore the constitutional order. Turkey, however, never entered into consultations.  
She invaded the country whose territorial integrity she had guaranteed. In addition, when after a short time the constitutional order was restored, the Turkish forces not only did they refrain from withdrawing, but they proceeded to the second stage of their invasion, while negotiations were taking place in Geneva. Thus, Turkey finally carried out her expansionist plans, occupying 37% of Cyprus, 52% of the island's coastline, 70% of its natural resources and 65% of its tourist infrastructure.
<p>
<strong> C.<a name="c">The condemnation of the Turkish  occupation.</a> </strong>
<p>
The Cyprus issue is <b>a typical international problem of invasion and occupation</b> of one state member of the UN by another, namely Turkey. The latter was ironically assigned the task - along with the UK and Greece - to guarantee Cyprus' sovereignty and independence. However, 22 years after the Turkish invasion and defying a series of UN resolutions, Turkey refuses to withdraw her occupation forces from the island.   
At present more than 35.000 Turkish troops are illegally stationed the north part of Cyprus, which is characterized by the Secretary General of U.N., as one of the most highly militarized areas in the world.
<p>
The international community has expressed itself virtually unanimously on the Cyprus issue, through a great number of Resolutions of international fora, such as the General Assembly and the Security Council of the U.N., the European Parliament, the Council of Europe, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Commonwealth. A number of <b>U.N. - Resolutions,</b>in particular, have repeatedly addressed the Cyprus situation in all its aspects.
They provide, inter alia, for the withdrawal of the Turkish army (Resolutions 353/1974 of the Security Council and 3212/1974, 37/253/1983 of the General Assembly) and the return of the refugees to their homes in safety (Resolution 3212/1974 of the General Assembly later endorsed by Security  Council Resolution 365/1975).
<p>
They also affirm that the present status quo is not acceptable (Security Council Resolution 774/1992) and outline the main principles on which a solution should be based. 
In this respect, in its most recent <b>Resolution 939/1994</b> the Security Council "reaffirms its position that a Cyprus settlement must be based on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international pesronality and a single citizenship,   
 with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded, and comprising two politically equal communities as described in the relevant Security Council Resolutions in a bi-communal and bi-zonal federation, and that such a settlement must exclude union in whole or in part with any other country or any form of partition or secession".
<p>
None of the above mentioned Resolutions has been accepted and implemented by the Turkish side. On the contrary, in November 1983, in the middle of yet another U.N. initiative, the Turkish Cypriot leadership, at the instigation of Turkey, proclaimed an "independent state" in the occupied part of Cyprus.  
United Nations Security Council Resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984) condemned the unilateral declaration and all subsequent secessionist acts, declared them illegal and invalid and called for their immediate withdrawal.   
They also called on all states not to recognize the purported state set up by secessionist acts and called on them not to facilitate or in any way assist the secessionist entity. No other state but Turkey has so far accorded recognition to the illegal "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus".
<p>
<B>The European Parliament</B>, on its part, has also adopted several Resolutions concerning all aspects of the Cyprus issue (i.e. Resolution 17.11.1983 denouncing the secessionist entity, Resolution 15.12.1988 condemning the destruction of cultural heritage in the occupied territories, Resolution 15.3.1990 urging the  
 Turkish Government to demonstrate the will and spirit of cooperation with a v iew to resuming the intra-community negotiations, Resolution 21.1.1993 calling Turkey to withdraw its occupation troops, Resolution 12.7.1995 expressing its support to Cyprus's accession in the E.U., Resolution 28.3.1996 condemning the statement by Mr Denktash on the killing of the missing persons and welcoming the proposal of President Clerides for the demilitarisation of Cyprus).
<p>
As regards the <b>Council of Europe</b>, the Parliamentary Assembly has adopted a number of Resolutions which condemn the illegal declaration of the pseudostate, call for the restoration of the unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus, for the respect of the human rights of its inhabitants as well as for the withdrawal of foreign troops (Recommendations 974/1983, 1056/1987 Resolution 816/1984).
<p>
<strong> D.<a name="d"> Mass violations of Human  rights. </a> </strong>
<p>
The Cyprus issue, is also a flagrant case of <b> continued mass violations of basic human rights and freedoms </b>  by Turkey, in breach of the purposes and principles of the U.N.   
Charter and major international instruments in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Numerous resolutions of the U.N., including those of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Commission on Human Rights, the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination have been adopted over these twenty-two years concerning all aspects of violations of human rights in Cyprus.   
Turkey has so far failed to comply with any of them. 
<p>
Furthermore,	the Commission of Human Rights of the Council of Europe, an impartial judicial institution, having examined the three recourses of the Cyprus Government against Turkey for multiple violations of the European Convention of Human Rights (Applications 6780/74, 6950/75 and 8007/77), adopted two reports (in 1976 and 1983) in which it is concluded that Turkey is guilty of gross violations of human rights in Cyprus from 1974 onwards.
<p>
Turkish grave violations of the human rights in Cyprus are manifested in the following methods of "ethnic cleansing", a concept recently associated with the situation in Bosnia and condemned by the International community as a whole. 
<p>
<i>- Forcible eviction and displacement of persons from their homes and land. </i> <p>
The nearly 200.000 Greek Cypriots who were forcibly expelled from their homes by the Turkish invading forces in 1974, are still being prevented from returning there and are destitute refugees in their own country. At the same time they continue to be arbitrarily deprived of their property in the occupied area, which is being illegally distributed to persons other than the legal owners, including members of the Turkish occupation army and settlers form mainland Turkey.
<p>
The U.N., in resolutions 361(1974) of the Security Council and 3395(1975) of the General Assembly, have called for urgent measures to facilitate the voluntary return of all refugees to their homes in safety. Twenty-two years have elapsed since and Turkey arrogantly refuses to implement these resolutions.
<p>
<I> - Expulsion of the enclaved. </I> <p>
Out of the 20.000 Greek Cypriots who chose to stay by their ancestral homes after the invasion, less than 600 people still remain now in the Karpass peninsula at the eastern corner of Cyprus. This is the result of a sustained campaign of harassment, discrimination and oppression by the occupation forces which led to outright expulsion and gradual deterioration of the living conditions of the enclaved. The purpose has been to force them to leave their lands and make room for imported settlers from Turkey.
<p>
The report on the U.N. operations in Cyprus (Dec.'95) describes in detail the oppressive methods used against the enclaved, such as restrictions on free movement, no access to medical care and educational services, deprivation of property etc.   
The report also points out that a review carried out by UNFICYP confirmed that the communities of Greek Cypriots and Maronites "were the objects of very severe restrictions, which curtailed the exercise of many basic freedoms and had the effect of ensuring that, inexorably, with the passage of time, they would cease to exist in the northern part of the island".
   The regime in the occupied areas has applied racist and inhuman policies against the enclaved, notwithstanding the commitments the Turkish side agreed on in Vienna in August 1975 (3rd Vienna Agreement) to ensure that the enclaved "lead a normal life".
<p>
<I>- Systematic plundering of the  Cypriot cultural heritage in the occupied territories.</I> <p>
The island's cultural heritage that has existed for thousands of years and is part of the common heritage of mankind, is being systematically and deliberately destroyed in the occupied areas.  
  Greek orthodox churches continue to be converted into mosques, vandalized or turned into entertainment centers while priceless treasures and works of art are smuggled out of the country or destroyed, in defiance of relevant resolutions and calls of European and International Organizations (such as the European Parliament, the Council of Europe, UNESCO, etc.) to stop the distraction and cooperate for the protection of the ancient and religious monuments of Cyprus.   
  In a further effort, to alter the historic character of those places, names of villages, towns and toponyms that had been used for centuries are being arbitrarily changed to Turkish ones, in contravention of  international law and U.N. resolutions on the standardization of geographical names.
<p>
<I> - Colonization of the occupied territories. </I> <p>
According to Turkish-Cypriots sources, nearly 80.000 settlers from Turkey have been transplanted illegally to the occupied part of Cyprus since 1974 and given properties usurped from the expelled Greek Cypriots.    
They were given "citizenship" and "voting rights" in an attempt to adulterate the will of the Turkish Cypriot community and provide support to the occupation regime.   
 At the same time, the indigenous Turkish Cypriot population, forced to emigrate because of the bad living conditions prevailing in the north, continuously decreases. 
 From 120.000 people in 1974 they barely number 80.000 today. Since another 35.000 Turkish soldiers are permanently stationed on the island, the proportion between T/C and Turks is almost 1 to 2.
<p>
The colonization policy of Turkey was fully confirmed and exposed in the report submitted to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe by the Spanish parliamentarian Alfons Cuco, who conducted a special mission in Cyprus. The Parliamentary Assembly, based on this report, condemned such colonization by its recommendation 1197/1992.
<p>
<I> - Missing Persons.  </I> <p>
One should not forget that approximately 1.500 Greek Cypriots and Greeks are still <b>missing</b>, as a result of the 1974 Turkish military operations. 
 A special Committee, established by the U.N. in 1981, has been assigned with the task to investigate their fate, but so far it has not produced any results, owning to the unwillingness of the Turkish side to cooperate.
<p>
The shocking statement of the T/C leader Mr. Denktash that these people were in fact killed in cold blood for past grievances by Turkish Cypriot irregulars, should not obstruct the work of this Committee. The purely humanitarian character of this aspect of the Cyprus tragedy, requires its full and exhaustive investigation, away from any political expediencies, so that safe and indisputable conclusions are reached concerning the fate of each and every missing person.
<p>
<strong> E.<a name="e">The efforts towards a negotiated  settlement.</a> </strong>
<p>
During the past 22 years there have been numerous efforts to reach a negotiated settlement but to no avail. The Greek Cypriots, being the victim, were persistently seeking and are still pursuing a prompt solution to the problem. Throughout this period, they have adopted a positive and constructive attitude and made serious concessions which, unfortunately, were only interpreted by the Turkish side as a sign of weakness. At the same time, Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots have systematically undermined the initiatives of the Secretary General, leading them to an impasse.
<p>
Turkey's alleged support for a bicommunal - bizonal federation has proved to be completely insincere. The statements made at intervals by the Turkish and the Turkish Cypriot side as well as the official position adopted by the latter during the intercommunal dialogue show that the Turkish side aims at a loose confederation of two separate, independent states, and, in this way, at the consolidation of the status quo.   
Moreover, ever since the intercommunal dialogue started till today, whenever the Secretary General submitted concrete proposals leading in fact to a bicommunal - bizonal federation, even under hard conditions for the Greek side, the Turkish side rejected them or obstructed any progress (working points 1984, integrated documents 1985, draft framework agreement 1986, procedural formula 1987, outline  for an overall agreement 1988, Set of Ideas 1992 - Confidence Building Measures 1993).   
Their negative attitude was noted by the Secretary General and the Security Council as well. The former, in his report dated 14.11.92 pointed out that "the positions of the T/C side are, in a fundamental way, outside the framework of the Set of Ideas", while the Security Council in its resolution 789/92 expressly attributed the responsibility for the failure to the T/C side and called upon it to revise its position.
<p>
Fully aware of the situation, the U.N. Secretary General in his most complete report to date (of May 30, 1994) referred to the <b> lack of political will of the T/C side </b> for the achievement of any solution as a "well-known scenario".
<p>
<b> Greece</b>, which unwaiveringly <b>supports the mission of good offices </b> of the U.N. Secretary-General, will continue working, in close contact and co-operation with all international actors towards a  just, viable and functional solution of the Cyprus problem based on the U.N. Resolutions and the High Level Agreements of 1977 and 1979. The aim is to reach a solution providing for the establishment of a federal bizonal and bicommunal state of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international personality as well as a single citizenship and whose independence and territorial integrity will be safeguarded and in which the fundamental freedoms of all citizens, including their political, economic, social and cultural rights.
<p>
The fact that the intercommunal dialogue, conducted under the auspices of the U.N. Secretary-General within the framework of his mission of good offices, had already started before 1974,  was resumed after the invasion, and continues to this day, albeit without result, does not mean that the Cyprus problem is of concern only to the two communities. This format of dialogue was one of the alternatives and was chosen in the hope that progress would be easier to achieve through dialogue. The failure of this method up to now has made it necessary to seek alternative ways of approaching the problem, something the Security Council has called for in resolutions 939/94, 889/93, 774/92.	
<p>
In the meantime, President Clerides made a comprehensive proposal for the <b> demilitarization </b> of the island as a means of reducing all eventual dangers of destabilization and, hence, conducing to the improvement of the general climate. This courageous proposal has been welcomed by most of the international actors and should be supported as a first priority.
<p>
Lately, many international actors (USA, E.U. etc.) have expressed their readiness to actively contribute to the U.N. efforts towards a just and viable solution. However, if the resumption of a sincere and fruitful intercommunal dialogue is to be secured, a mutual agreement on a minimum of common positions should definitely precede. The international community ought to intervene, without delay, towards Ankara and convince her to abide by the basic framework as described above. The key to the Cyprus problem lies almost exclusively in Turkey's hands.
<p>
<strong>F.<a name="f">Towards accession to the E.U.</a> </strong>
<p>
Cyprus is politically, culturally and historically part of Europe and participates in most of its institutions. It has been a full member of the Council of Europe since 1961. In 1972 it concluded an Association Agreement with the European Economic Community and in 1987 a Customs Union Protocol.
<p>
Furthermore, the E.U. has repeatedly stated that the status quo on the island is unacceptable, that the Cyprus problem affects its relations with Turkey, as clearly reflected in E.U.'s Dublin declaration (26.6.1990), and the importance it attaches to making substantial efforts to achieve a just and viable solution, in line with the U.N. resolutions, on the basis of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation (Madrid Summit, December 1995).
<p>
In July 1990, the Republic of Cyprus submitted its application for accession to the E.U. By that time, Cyprus's economy had made a remarkable and speedy recovery following the devastating effect of the 1974 Turkish invasion. The <b> E.U. Commission's opinion (avis) </b> on the application, issued in June 1993, confirmed Cyprus'  European character, vocation and eligibility for membership. It also confirmed its capacity to fulfil the obligations of membership and to adopt the Acquis Communautaire.
<p>
The Council, on the basis of its reassessment on the Cyprus situation and taking into account the E.U. Observer's reports, adopted the <b> 6 March 1995 decision </b> which places Cyprus in a definite and irreversible course to E.U. membership. The main element of the decision provides that accession negotiations will start on the basis of the Commission's proposals six months after the conclusion of the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.
<p>
The E.U.-Cyprus Association Council at its meeting on 12 June 1995, in reconfirming the Council's 6 March decision, adopted a resolution on the establishment of a structured dialogue between the E.U. and Cyprus, already effectively underway.
<p>
In the meanwhile four consecutive European Councils (Corfu 1994, Essen 1994, Cannes 1995, Madrid 1995) clearly stated that the next enlargement of the E.U. will involve Cyprus and Malta.
<p>	
<strong> G.<a name="g">The prospective accession as a catalyst for the solution.</a></strong>
<p>
The period until the commencement of the accession talks, offers a unique opportunity for a solution to the political problem of the island. It is in the interest of all concerned, including Turkey, to take advantage of this opportunity and embrace a solution. It is hoped that both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots will acknowledge the beneficial effects of accession to all domains of public life, including the economic, the political and the institutional field, and will finally give their consent to Cyprus's  joining the E.U. For it is only a paradox that Turkey, while aspiring to become a member of the E.U. herself, at the same time, purporting to act in the interests of the Turkish-Cypriots, she denies them the security and prosperity they would enjoy from Cyprus's E.U. membership.
<p>
At the same time, <b> membership to the European family may offer a new insight </b>and furnish new ideas as to the best way for dealing with the problem. The union's "acquis" could give the opportunity for accommodating - in a most satisfactory way - the basic parameters of the problem while keeping in line with the U.N. provisions.
<p>
All arguments that the Treaty of Guarantee and the Constitution of the Republic do not allow Cyprus's membership to any international organization to which Greece and Turkey are not also members, are unfounded and misleading.  The Treaty of Guarantee, excluding the "participation in whole or in part in any political or economic union with any state whatsoever", it is clear that it referred to the annexation-union of the whole or part of the island with one of the guarantor powers. As for the Constitution, the provisions granting the Greek Cypriot President or the Turkish Cypriot vice-president the right to veto the accession of Cyprus to international organisations in which Greece and Turkey were not both members, have long ago become void, on Turkish responsibility. It is completely unacceptable for the side that violated the above texts and continues to do so, to invoke them, distorting their contents. Moreover, the Avis of the European Commission recognized the application for membership as sound and valid and the Government of Cyprus as the legitimate government of the island and its sole interlocutor.
<p>
Furthermore, in no text  the settlement of the island's political problem is considered as a prerequisite for the accession of Cyprus. Such a condition would be inconceivable since it would mean further punishment for Cyprus which has already been the victim of an illegitimate invasion-occupation. It would also be tantamount to rewarding Turkey, to which a veto power would be granted on a matter that exclusively concerns Cyprus and the Union.
<p>
At any rate, following the conclusions of four consecutive European Councils (Corfu, Essen, Cannes and Madrid), Cyprus has <b> irrevocably embarked on its accession course.</b> Her accession is a matter concerning solely the Union and Cyprus and no third party can intervene, let alone oppose, this procedure. Turkey's attempt to force its way through and use Cyprus as a vehicle to draw benefits and advantages in relation to her own European ambitions is totally unacceptable and rejectable.
<p>
Indeed, <b> the island's future accession may act as a catalyst</b>. European and US  officials should make clear to Turkey that she is not in a position to obstruct the future accession of Cyprus to the E.U. It is only then that the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leadership may decide to cooperate for a settlement so that Turkish Cypriots may benefit from the accession.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> THE FACTS: SHOT WHILE STANDING WITH HIS HANDS UP</H3>
At about 7.30 a.m. on Sunday, Turkish soldiers shot dead Petros Kakoullis,
a 50-year-old refugee from the occupied Lefkonico township who resided at
Avgorou village. Kakoullis was shot in the area behind the old Akhna
village Police Station, where Kakoullis had gone together with his son-in-
law Panicos Hadjiathanassiou to gather snails.
<P>Hadjiathanassiou said that at some point he could not see where his father-
in-law was. Eventually he spotted him at about 200 metres behind the old
Police Station standing with his hands up. He also saw two Turkish soldiers
on the ground aiming their guns at Kakoullis and then shooting him. When he
fell on the ground, the two Turkish soldiers approached him and fired
another shot at him.
<P>Efforts are being made through the United Nations Peace-Keeping Force for
the body of Kakoullis to be given to the Cyprus police.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN: A COLD BLOODED MURDER BY TURKISH ARMY</H3>
n behalf of the Cyprus Government, I would like to stress that the killing
of Petros Kakoullis was a cold-blooded murder, which contains an element of
pre-meditation, if one takes into account the fact that there was not any
Turkish occupation army post in the location where the heinous crime was
perpetrated. The Turkish soldiers left a nearby army post and went to the
scene of the crime. According to an eye-witness, the victim Petros
Kakoullis was quite harmless and was of no danger for the soldiers.
When they shouted, he raised his hands with the intention of giving
himself up. Despite this, the two Turkish soldiers shot him and when he
fell down, they approached and fired at him again from close quarters while
he was lying on the ground.
<P>As if this unacceptable behaviour from the point of view of justice and law
was not enough, they did not allow anyone to approach the victim and we do
not known when exactly he died, as he was left lying on the ground for
almost four hours.
<P>The Chief of Police is on his way to Akhna to meet his opposite number at
the British Bases. He has already spoken to him on the telephone and asked
the intervention of the Bases in the conduct of investigations. Also the
Police has summoned to Cyprus from England Professor P. Vanezis, an expert
in medical jurisprudence, to carry out the post mortem. When the body of
the victim is handed to the lawful authorities of the Republic, the post
mortem prescribed by law will have to be carried out.
<P>Also Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides is having contacts with the
political heads of UNFICYP and the British Bases as well as the British
High Commission so as to ensure at this stage the conduct of an impartial
investigation into the murder. Firstly, we have to show how false the
unacceptable and wholly unfounded Turkish allegations is that the soldiers
first fired warning shots and subsequently, when the victim tried to escape,
they shot him dead. This claim is unfounded and clashes with what
the eye-witness said. Of course, both the findings of the
investigation and the post mortem will show that this is a baseless
allegation.
<P>We should not forget the circumstances in which National Guardsman Stelios
Panayis was shot dead not long ago. There are many similarities between the
murder in cold blood of Stelios Panayi and the present heinous crime. It is
easy for anybody who is not familiar with the area to enter by mistake the
Turkish controlled area. But this in no way justifies the response
of the Turkish occupation forces to kill him. This is what makes the
incident unacceptable and barbaric. As is natural, the continuing Turkish
provocations make the Cyprus people feel abhorrence and indignation.
However, I trust that we all realize that these provocations will have to
be faced cool-headedly. It is evident that the goal of these provocations
is to reconfirm the division partition of the island and the Turkish
position that it is allegedly impossible for the two communities to
co-exist and reunite Cyprus. This is the policy followed by Ankara and
Denktash and we do not intend to facilitate this policy.
<P>On the contrary, we shall continue to seek a peaceful and viable solution
to our problem and we shall decide how we shall react to this provocative
action. In the coming days we shall calmly decide the measures we shall
take.
<P>Asked if the murder of Kakoullis was what Turkish Foreign Minister official
Inal Batu had in mind when he spoke of counter-measures to the joint
exercises carried out by Greece and Cyprus in the context of the Nikiforos
manoeuvres, the Government Spokesman said: &quot;If indeed Turkey found an
unarmed and harmless Greek Cypriot who was posing no danger to the
occupation forces and killed him just to react to the strengthening of the
island's defences, then it has committed an act of cowardice. However,
I doubt very much if Turkey wants to project such a picture to the
world&quot;.
<P>Replying to another question, Mr Cassoulides said that by acts such as the
murder of Kakoullis in cold blood, the Turkish side &quot;is trying to influence
unfavourably efforts being made for the finding of a solution, in the sense
that it is sending a message about its perceived need to maintain division
and avoid peaceful coexistence. Therefore, it is obvious that this is the
aim of such actions&quot;.

<H4>Meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the participating
States of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
(CSCE): Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Czech and
Slovak Federal Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,

<H4>Paris, 19 - 21 November 1990</H4>


<H3><A NAME="Cha1.1">A new era of Democracy, Peace and Unity</A></H3>


<P>We, the Heads of State or Government of the States
participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe, have assembled in Paris at a time of profound change and
historic expectations. The era of confrontation and division of
Europe has ended. We declare that henceforth our relations will
be founded on respect and co-operation.</P>

<P>Europe is liberating itself from the legacy of the past. The
courage of men and women, the strength of the will of the peoples
and the power of the ideas of the Helsinki Final Act have opened
a new era of democracy, peace and unity in Europe.</P>

<P>Ours is a time for fulfilling the hopes and expectations our
peoples have cherished for decades : steadfast commitment to
democracy based on human rights and fundamental freedoms;
prosperity through economic liberty and social justice; and equal
security for all our countries.</P>

<P>The Ten Principles of the Final Act will guide us towards
this ambitious future, just as they have lighted our way towards
better relations for the past fifteen years. Full implementation
of all CSCE commitments must form the basis for the initiatives
we are now taking to enable our nations to live in accordance
with their aspirations.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.1.1">Human Rights, Democracy and Rule of Law</A></H4>

<P>We undertake to build, consolidate and strengthen democracy
as the only system of government of our nations. In this
endeavour, we will abide by the following:</P>

<P>Human rights and fundamental freedoms are the birthright of
all human beings, are inalienable and are guaranteed by law.
Their protection and promotion is the first responsibility of
government. Respect for them is an essential safeguard against an
over-mighty State. Their observance and full exercise are the
foundation of freedom, justice and peace.</P>

<P>Democratic government is based on the will of the people,
expressed regularly through free and fair elections. Democracy
has as its foundation respect for the human person and the rule
of law. Democracy is the best safeguard of freedom of expression,
tolerance of all groups of society, and equality of opportunity
for each person.</P>

<P>Democracy, with its representative and pluralist character,
entails accountability to the electorate, the obligation of
public authorities to comply with the law and justice
administered impartially. No one will be above the law.</P>

<P>We affirm that, without discrimination,</P>

<UL>
<LI>every individual has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and
religion or belief,
<LI>freedom of expression,
<LI>freedom of association and peaceful assembly,
<LI>freedom of movement;
</UL>

no one will be:

<UL>
<LI>subject to arbitrary arrest or detention,
<LI>subject to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment;
</UL>

everyone also has the right :

<UL>
<LI>to know and act upon his rights,
<LI>to participate in free and fair elections,
<LI>to fair and public trial if charged with an offence,
<LI>to own property alone or in association and to exercise
individual enterprise,
<LI>to enjoy his economic, social and cultural rights.
</UL>

<P>We affirm that the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and
religious identity of national minorities will be protected and
that persons belonging to national minorities have the right
freely to express, preserve and develop that identity without any
discrimination and in full equality before the law.</P>

<P>We will ensure that everyone will enjoy recourse to
effective remedies, national or international, against any
violation of his rights.</P>

<P>Full respect for these precepts is the bedrock on which we
will seek to construct the new Europe.</P>

<P>Our States will co-operate and support each other with the
aim of making democratic gains irreversible.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.1.2">Economic Liberty and Responsibility</A></H4>

<P>Economic liberty, social justice and environmental
responsibility are indispensable for prosperity.</P>

<P>The free will of the individual, exercised in democracy and
protected by the rule of law, forms the necessary basis for
successful economic and social development. We will promote
economic activity which respects and upholds human dignity.</P>

<P>Freedom and political pluralism are necessary elements in
our common objective of developing market economies towards
sustainable economic growth, prosperity, social justice,
expanding employment and efficient use of economic resources. The
success of the transition to market economy by countries making
efforts to this effect is important and in the interest of us
all. It will enable us to share a higher level of prosperity
which is our common objective. We will co-operate to this end.</P>

<P>Preservation of the environment is a shared responsibility
of all our nations. While supporting national and regional
efforts in this field, we must also look to the pressing need for
joint action on a wider scale.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.1.3">Friendly Relations among Participating States</A></H4>

<P>Now that a new era is dawning in Europe, we are determined
to expand and strengthen friendly relations and co-operation
among the States of Europe, the United States of America and
Canada, and to promote friendship among our peoples.</P>

<P>To uphold and promote democracy, peace and unity in Europe,
we solemnly pledge our full commitment to the Ten Principles of
the Helsinki Final Act. We affirm the continuing validity of the
Ten Principles and our determination to put them into practice.
All the Principles apply equally and unreservedly, each of them
being interpreted taking into account the others. They form the
basis for our relations.</P>

<P>In accordance with our obligations under the Charter of the
United Nations and commitments under the Helsinki Final Act, we
renew our pledge to refrain from the threat or use of force
against the territorial integrity or political independence of
any State, or from acting in any other manner inconsistent with
the principles or purposes of those documents. We recall that
non-compliance with obligations under the Charter of the United
Nations constitutes a violation of international law.</P>

<P>We reaffirm our commitment to settle disputes by peaceful
means. We decide to develop mechanisms for the prevention and
resolution of conflicts among the participating States.</P>

<P>With the ending of the division of Europe, we will strive
for a new quality in our security relations while fully
respecting each other's freedom of choice in that respect.
Security is indivisible and the security of every participating
State is inseparably linked to that of all the others. We
therefore pledge to co-operate in strengthening confidence and
security among us and in promoting arms control and disarmament.</P>

<P>We welcome the Joint Declaration of Twenty-Two States on the
improvement of their relations.</P>

<P>Our relations will rest on our common adherence to
democratic values and to human rights and fundamental freedoms.
We are convinced that in order to strengthen peace and security
among our States, the advancement of democracy, and respect for
and effective exercise of human rights, are indispensable. We
reaffirm the equal rights of peoples and their right to self-
determination in conformity with the Charter of the United
Nations and with the relevant norms of international law,
including those relating to territorial integrity of States.</P>

<P>We are determined to enhance political consultation and to
widen co-operation to solve economic, social, environmental,
cultural and humanitarian problems. This common resolve and our
growing interdependence will help to overcome the mistrust of
decades, to increase stability and to build a united Europe.</P>

<P>We want Europe to be a source of peace, open to dialogue and
to co-operation with other countries, welcoming exchanges and
involved in the search for common responses to the challenges of
the future.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.1.4">Security</A></H4>

<P>Friendly relations among us will benefit from the
consolidation of democracy and improved security.</P>

<P>We welcome the signature of the Treaty on Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe by twenty-two participating States, which will
lead to lower levels of armed forces. We endorse the adoption of
a substantial new set of Confidence- and Security-building
Measures which will lead to increased transparency and confidence
among all participating States. These are important steps towards
enhanced stability and security in Europe.</P>

<P>The unprecedented reduction in armed forces resulting from
the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, together with
new approaches to security and co-operation within the CSCE
process, will lead to a new perception of security in Europe and
a new dimension in our relations. In this context we fully
recognize the freedom of States to choose their own security
arrangements.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.1.5">Unity</A></H4>

<P>Europe whole and free is calling for a new beginning. We
invite our peoples to join in this great endeavour.</P>

<P>We note with great satisfaction the Treaty on the Final
Settlement with respect to Germany signed in Moscow on 12
September 1990 and sincerely welcome the fact that the German
people have united to become one State in accordance with the
principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-
operation in Europe and in full accord with their neighbours. The
establishment of the national unity of Germany is an important
contribution to a just and lasting order of peace for a united,
democratic Europe aware of its responsibility for stability,
peace and co-operation.</P>

<P>The participation of both North American and European States
is a fundamental characteristic of the CSCE; it underlies its
past achievements and is essential to the future of the CSCE
process. An abiding adherence to shared values and our common
heritage are the ties which bind us together. With all the rich
diversity of our nations, we are united in our commitment to
expand our co-operation in all fields. The challenges confronting
us can only be met by common action, co-operation and solidarity.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.1.6">The CSCE and the World</A></H4>

<P>The destiny of our nations is linked to that of all other
nations. We support fully the United Nations and the enhancement
of its role in promoting international peace, security and
justice. We reaffirm our commitment to the principles and
purposes of the United Nations as enshrined in the Charter and
condemn all violations of these principles. We recognize with
satisfaction the growing role of the United Nations in world
affairs and its increasing effectiveness, fostered by the
improvement in relations among our States.</P>

<P>Aware of the dire needs of a great part of the world, we
commit ourselves to solidarity with all other countries.
Therefore, we issue a call from Paris today to all the nations of
the world. We stand ready to join with any and all States in
common efforts to protect and advance the community of
fundamental human values.</P>


<H3><A NAME="Cha1.2">Guidelines for the future</A></H3>


<P>Proceeding from our firm commitment to the full
implementation of all CSCE principles and provisions, we now
resolve to give a new impetus to a balanced and comprehensive
development of our co-operation in order to address the needs and
aspirations of our peoples.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.2.1">Human Dimension</A></H4>

<P>We declare our respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms to be irrevocable. We will fully implement and build
upon the provisions relating to the human dimension of the CSCE.</P>

<P>Proceeding from the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of
the Conference on the Human Dimension, we will cooperate to
strengthen democratic institutions and to promote the application
of the rule of law. To that end, we decide to convene a seminar
of experts in Oslo from 4 to 15 November 1991.</P>

<P>Determined to foster the rich contribution of national
minorities to the life of our societies, we undertake further to
improve their situation. We reaffirm our deep conviction that
friendly relations among our peoples, as well as peace, justice,
stability and democracy, require that the ethnic, cultural,
linguistic and religious identity of national minorities be
protected and conditions for the promotion of that identity be
created. We declare that questions related to national minorities
can only be satisfactorily resolved in a democratic political
framework. We further acknowledge that the rights of persons
belonging to national minorities must be fully respected as part
of universal human rights. Being aware of the urgent need for
increased cooperation on, as well as better protection of,
national minorities, we decide to convene a meeting of experts on
national minorities to be held in Geneva from 1 to 19 July 1991.</P>

<P>We express our determination to combat all forms of racial
and ethnic hatred, antisemitism, xenophobia and discrimination
against anyone as well as persecution on religious and
ideological grounds.</P>

<P>In accordance with our CSCE commitments, we stress that free
movement and contacts among our citizens as well as the free flow
of information and ideas are crucial for the maintenance and
development of free societies and flourishing cultures. We
welcome increased tourism and visits among our countries.</P>

<P>The human dimension mechanism has proved its usefulness, and
we are consequently determined to expand it to include new
procedures involving, inter alia, the services of experts or a
roster of eminent persons experienced in human rights issues
which could be raised under the mechanism. We shall provide, in
the context of the mechanism, for individuals to be involved in
the protection of their rights. Therefore, we undertake to
develop further our commitments in this respect, in particular at
the Moscow Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension,
without prejudice to obligations under existing international
instruments to which our States may be parties.</P>

<P>We recognize the important contribution of the Council of
Europe to the promotion of human rights and the principles of
democracy and the rule of law as well as to the development of
cultural co-operation. We welcome moves by several participating
States to join the Council of Europe and adhere to its European
Convention on Human Rights. We welcome as well the readiness of
the Council of Europe to make its experience available to the
CSCE.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.2.2">Security</A></H4>

<P>The changing political and military environment in Europe
opens new possibilities for common efforts in the field of
military security. We will build on the important achievements
attained in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and
in the Negotiations on Confidence- and Security-building
Measures. We undertake to continue the CSBM negotiations under
the same mandate, and to seek to conclude them no later than the
Follow-up Meeting of the CSCE to be held in Helsinki in 1992. We
also welcome the decision of the participating States concerned
to continue the CFE negotiation under the same mandate and to
seek to conclude it no later than the Helsinki Follow-up Meeting.
Following a period for national preparations, we look forward to
a more structured co-operation among all participating States on
security matters, and to discussions and consultations among the
thirty-four participating States aimed at establishing by 1992,
from the conclusion of the Helsinki Follow-up Meeting, new
negotiations on disarmament and confidence and security building
open to all participating States.</P>

<P>We call for the earliest possible conclusion of the
Convention on an effectively verifiable, global and comprehensive
ban on chemical weapons, and we intend to be original signatories
to it.</P>

<P>We reaffirm the importance of the Open Skies initiative and
call for the successful conclusion of the negotiations as soon as
possible.</P>

<P>Although the threat of conflict in Europe has diminished,
other dangers threaten the stability of our societies. We are
determined to co-operate in defending democratic institutions
against activities which violate the independence, sovereign
equality or territorial integrity of the participating States.
These include illegal activities involving outside pressure,
coercion and subversion.</P>

<P>We unreservedly condemn, as criminal, all acts, methods and
practices of terrorism and express our determination to work for
its eradication both bilaterally and through multilateral co-
operation. We will also join together in combating illicit
trafficking in drugs.</P>

<P>Being aware that an essential complement to the duty of
States to refrain from the threat or use of force is the peaceful
settlement of disputes, both being essential factors for the
maintenance and consolidation of international peace and
security, we will not only seek effective ways of preventing,
through political means, conflicts which may yet emerge, but also
define, in conformity with international law, appropriate
mechanisms for the peaceful resolution of any disputes which may
arise. Accordingly, we undertake to seek new forms of co-
operation in this area, in particular a range of methods for the
peaceful settlement of disputes, including mandatory third-party
involvement. We stress that full use should be made in this
context of the opportunity of the Meeting on the Peaceful
Settlement of Disputes which will be convened in Valletta at the
beginning of 1991. The Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs
will take into account the Report of the Valletta Meeting.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.2.3">Economic Co-operation</A></H4>

<P>We stress that economic co-operation based on market economy
constitutes an essential element of our relations and will be
instrumental in the construction of a prosperous and united
Europe. Democratic institutions and economic liberty foster
economic and social progress, as recognized in the Document of
the Bonn Conference on Economic Co-operation, the results of
which we strongly support.</P>

<P>We underline that co-operation in the economic field,
science and technology is now an important pillar of the CSCE.
The participating States should periodically review progress and
give new impulses in these fields.</P>

<P>We are convinced that our overall economic co-operation
should be expanded, free enterprise encouraged and trade
increased and diversified according to GATT rules. We will
promote social justice and progress and further the welfare of
our peoples. We recognize in this context the importance of
effective policies to address the problem of unemployment.</P>

<P>We reaffirm the need to continue to support democratic
countries in transition towards the establishment of market
economy and the creation of the basis for self-sustained economic
and social growth, as already undertaken by the Group of twenty-
four countries. We further underline the necessity of their
increased integration, involving the acceptance of disciplines as
well as benefits, into the international economic and financial
system.</P>

<P>We consider that increased emphasis on economic co-operation
within the CSCE process should take into account the interests of
developing participating States.</P>

<P>We recall the link between respect for and promotion of
human rights and fundamental freedoms and scientific progress.
Co-operation in the field of science and technology will play an
essential role in economic and social development. Therefore, it
must evolve towards a greater sharing of appropriate scientific
and technological information and knowledge with a view to
overcoming the technological gap which exists among the
participating States. We further encourage the participating
States to work together in order to develop human potential and
the spirit of free enterprise.</P>

<P>We are determined to give the necessary impetus to co-
operation among our States in the fields of energy, transport and
tourism for economic and social development. We welcome, in
particular, practical steps to create optimal conditions for the
economic and rational development of energy resources, with due
regard for environmental considerations.</P>

<P>We recognize the important role of the European Community in
the political and economic development of Europe. International
economic organizations such as the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE), the Bretton Woods Institutions, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (ECD), the
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC) also have a significant task in
promoting economic co-operation, which will be further enhanced
by the establishment of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD). In order to pursue our objectives, we stress
the necessity for effective co-ordination of the activities of
these organizations and emphasize the need to find methods for
all our States to take part in these activities.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.2.4">Environment</A></H4>

<P>We recognize the urgent need to tackle the problems of the
environment and the importance of individual and co-operative
efforts in this area. We pledge to intensify our endeavours to
protect and improve our environment in order to restore and
maintain a sound ecological balance in air, water and soil.
Therefore, we are determined to make full use of the CSCE as a
framework for the formulation of common environmental commitments
and objectives, and thus to pursue the work reflected in the
Report of the Sofia Meeting on the Protection of the Environment.</P>

<P>We emphasize the significant role of a well-informed society
in enabling the public and individuals to take initiatives to
improve the environment. To this end, we commit ourselves to
promoting public awareness and education on the environment as
well as the public reporting of the environmental impact of
policies, projects and programmes.</P>

<P>We attach priority to the introduction of clean and low-
waste technology, being aware of the need to support countries
which do not yet have their own means for appropriate measures.</P>

<P>We underline that environmental policies should be supported
by appropriate legislative measures and administrative structures
to ensure their effective implementation.</P>

<P>We stress the need for new measures providing for the
systematic evaluation of compliance with the existing commitments
and, moreover, for the development of more ambitious commitments
with regard to notification and exchange of information about the
state of the environment and potential environmental hazards. We
also welcome the creation of the European Environment Agency
(EEA).</P>

<P>We welcome the operational activities, problem-oriented
studies and policy reviews in various existing international
organizations engaged in the protection of the environment, such
as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We emphasize
the need for strengthening their co-operation and for their
efficient co-ordination.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.2.5">Culture</A></H4>

<P>We recognize the essential contribution of our common
European culture and our shared values in overcoming the division
of the continent. Therefore, we underline our attachment to
creative freedom and to the protection and promotion of our
cultural and spiritual heritage, in all its richness and
diversity.</P>

<P>In view of the recent changes in Europe, we stress the
increased importance of the Cracow Symposium and we look forward
to its consideration of guidelines for intensified co-operation
in the field of culture. We invite the Council of Europe to
contribute to this Symposium.</P>

<P>In order to promote greater familiarity amongst our peoples,
we favour the establishment of cultural centres in cities of
other participating States as well as increased co-operation in
the audio-visual field and wider exchange in music, theatre,
literature and the arts.</P>

<P>We resolve to make special efforts in our national policies
to promote better understanding, in particular among young
people, through cultural exchanges, co-operation in all fields of
education and, more specifically, through teaching and training
in the languages of other participating States. We intend to
consider first results of this action at the Helsinki Follow-up
Meeting in 1992.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.2.6">Migrant Workers</A></H4>

<P>We recognize that the issues of migrant workers and their
families legally residing in host countries have economic,
cultural and social aspects as well as their human dimension. We
reaffirm that the protection and promotion of their rights, as
well as the implementation of relevant international obligations,
is our common concern.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.2.7">Mediterranean</A></H4>

<P>We consider that the fundamental political changes that have
occurred in Europe have a positive relevance to the Mediterranean
region. Thus, we will continue efforts to strengthen security and
co-operation in the Mediterranean as an important factor for
stability in Europe. We welcome the Report of the Palma de
Mallorca Meeting on the Mediterranean, the results of which we
all support.</P>

<P>We are concerned with the continuing tensions in the region,
and renew our determination to intensify efforts towards finding
just, viable and lasting solutions, through peaceful means, to
outstanding crucial problems, based on respect for the principles
of the Final Act.</P>

<P>We wish to promote favourable conditions for a harmonious
development and diversification of relations with the non-
participating Mediterranean States. Enhanced co-operation with
these States will be pursued with the aim of promoting economic
and social development and thereby enhancing stability in the
region. To this end, we will strive together with these countries
towards a substantial narrowing of the prosperity gap between
Europe and its Mediterranean neighbours.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.2.8">Non-governmental Organizations</A></H4>

<P>We recall the major role that non-governmental
organizations, religious and other groups and individuals have
played in the achievement of the objectives of the CSCE and will
further facilitate their activities for the implementation of the
CSCE commitments by the participating States. These
organizations, groups and individuals must be involved in an
appropriate way in the activities and new structures of the CSCE
in order to fulfil their important tasks.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Sec1.2.9">New structures and institutions of the CSCE Process</A></H4>

<P>Our common efforts to consolidate respect for human rights,
democracy and the rule of law, to strengthen peace and to promote
unity in Europe require a new quality of political dialogue and
co-operation and thus development of the structures of the CSCE.</P>

<P>The intensification of our consultations at all levels is of
prime importance in shaping our future relations. To this end, we
decide on the following</P>

<UL>
<LI> We, the Heads of State or Government, shall meet next time
     in Helsinki on the occasion of the CSCE Follow-up Meeting
     1992. Thereafter, we will meet on the occasion of subsequent
     follow-up meetings.

<LI> Our Ministers for Foreign Affairs will meet, as a Council,
     regularly and at least once a year. These meetings will
     provide the central forum for political consultations within
     the CSCE process. The Council will consider issues relevant
     to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and
     take appropriate decisions.

<LI> The first meeting of the Council will take place in Berlin.

<LI> A Committee of Senior Officials will prepare the meetings of
     the Council and carry out its decisions. The Committee will
     review current issues and may take appropriate decisions,
     including in the form of recommendations to the Council.

<LI> Additional meetings of the representatives of the
     participating States may be agreed upon to discuss questions
     of urgent concern.

<LI> The Council will examine the development of provisions for
     convening meetings of the Committee of Senior Officials in
     emergency situations.

<LI> Meetings of other Ministers may also be agreed by the
     participating States.

<LI> In order to provide administrative support for these
     consultations we establish a Secretariat in Prague.

<LI> Follow-up meetings of the participating States will be held,
     as a rule, every two years to allow the participating States
     to take stock of developments, review the implementation of
     their commitments and consider further steps in the CSCE
     process.

<LI> We decide to create a Conflict Prevention Centre in Vienna
     to assist the Council in reducing the risk of conflict.

<LI> We decide to establish an Office for Free Elections in
     Warsaw to facilitate contacts and the exchange of
     information on elections within participating States.

<LI> Recognizing the important role parliamentarians can play in
     the CSCE process, we call for greater parliamentary
     involvement in the CSCE, in particular through the creation
     of a CSCE parliamentary assembly, involving members of
     parliaments from all participating States. To this end, we
     urge that contacts be pursued at parliamentary level to
     discuss the field of activities, working methods and rules
     of procedure of such a CSCE parliamentary structure, drawing
     on existing experience and work already undertaken in this
     field.

<LI> We ask our Ministers for Foreign Affairs to review this
     matter on the occasion of their first meeting as a Council.
</UL>

<P>Procedural and organizational modalities relating to certain
provisions contained in the Charter of Paris for a New Europe are
set out in the Supplementary Document which is adopted together
with the Charter of Paris.</P>

<P>We entrust to the Council the further steps which may be
required to ensure the implementation of decisions contained in
the present document, as well as in the Supplementary Document,
and to consider further efforts for the strengthening of security
and co-operation in Europe. The Council may adopt any amendment
to the supplementary document which it may deem appropriate.</P>

<P>The original of the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, drawn
up in English, French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish, will
be transmitted to the Government of the French Republic, which
will retain it in its archives. Each of the participating States
will receive from the Government of the French Republic a true
copy of the Charter of Paris.</P>

<P>The text of the Charter of Paris will be published in each
participating State, which will disseminate it and make it known
as widely as possible.</P>

<P>The Government of the French Republic is requested to
transmit to the Secretary-General of the United Nations the text
of the Charter of Paris for a New Europe which is not eligible
for registration under Article 102 of the Charter of the United
Nations, with a view to its circulation to all the members of the
Organization as an official document of the United Nations.</P>

<P>The Government of the French Republic is also requested to
transmit the text of the Charter of Paris to all the other
international organizations mentioned in the text.</P>

<P>Wherefore, we, the undersigned High Representatives of the
participating States, mindful of the high political significance
we attach to the results of the Summit Meeting, and declaring our
determination to act in accordance with the provisions we have
adopted, have subscribed our signatures below :</P>

otherwise brought to an end in a manner that is regulated by law
in conformity with democratic parliamentary and constitutional
procedures.</P>
<P>(8)  The participating States consider that the presence of
observers, both foreign and domestic, can enhance the electoral
process for States in which elections are taking place. They
therefore invite observers from any other CSCE participating
States and any appropriate private institutions and organizations
who may wish to do so to observe the course of their national
election proceedings, to the extent permitted by law. They will
also endeavour to facilitate similar access for election
proceedings held below the national level. Such observers will
undertake not to interfere in the electoral proceedings.</P>

<P>Considering that solidarity among peoples, as well as the
common purpose of the participating States in achieving the aims
as set forth by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe, should lead to the development of better and closer
relations among them in all fields and thus to overcoming the
confrontation stemming from the character of their past
relations, and to better mutual understanding;</P>

efforts with a view to overcoming distrust and increasing
confidence, solving the problems that separate them and
cooperating in the interest of mankind;</P>

as their common interest in the development of co-operation
throughout Europe and among themselves and expressing their
intention to pursue efforts accordingly;</P>

among States;</P>

<P>Expressing their common adherence to the principles which

also respect each other's right freely to choose and develop its
political, social, economic and cultural systems as well as its
right to determine its laws and regulations.</P>

<P>Within the framework of international law, all the
participating States have equal rights and duties. They will
respect each other's right to define and conduct as it wishes its
relations with other States in accordance with international law
and in the spirit of the present Declaration. They consider that
their frontiers can be changed, in accordance with international
law, by peaceful means and by agreement. They also have the right

or not to be a party to bilateral or multilateral treaties
including the right to be or not to be a party to treaties of
alliance; they also have the right to neutrality.</P>

<H4><A NAME="H4.2">II. Refraining from the threat or use of force</A></H4>

<P>The participating States will refrain in their mutual
relations, as well as in their international relations in
general, from the threat or use of force against the territorial
integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other
manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations and
with the present Declaration. No consideration may be invoked to
serve to warrant resort to the threat or use of force in
contravention of this principle.</P>

<P>Accordingly, the participating States will refrain from any
acts constituting a threat of force or direct or indirect use of
force against another participating State. Likewise they will
refrain from any manifestation of force for the purpose of
inducing another participating State to renounce the full
exercise of its sovereign rights. Likewise they will also refrain
in their mutual relations from any act of reprisal by force.</P>

<P>No such threat or use of force will be employed as a means
of settling disputes, or questions likely to give rise to
disputes, between them.</P>

<H4><A NAME="H4.3">III. Inviolability of frontiers</A></H4>

<P>The participating States regard as inviolable all one
another's frontiers as well as the frontiers of all States in

with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations against the territorial integrity, political independence
or the unity of any participating State, and in particular from
any such action constituting a threat or use of force.</P>

<P>The participating States will likewise refrain from making
each other's territory the object of military occupation or other
direct or indirect measures of force in contravention of
international law, or the object of acquisition by means of such
measures or the threat of them. No such occupation or acquisition
will be recognized as legal.</P>


<H4><A NAME="H4.5">V. Peaceful settlement of disputes</A></H4>

peaceful means in such a manner as not to endanger international
peace and security, and justice.</P>

of international law.</P>

<P>For this purpose they will use such means as negotiation,
enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial
settlement or other peaceful means of their own choice including
any settlement procedure agreed to in advance of disputes to
which they are parties.</P>

above peaceful means, the parties to a dispute will continue to
seek a mutually agreed way to settle the dispute peacefully.</P>

<P>Participating States, parties to a dispute among them, as

external affairs falling within the domestic jurisdiction of
another participating State, regardless of their mutual
relations.</P>

<P>They will accordingly refrain from any form of armed
intervention or threat of such intervention against another
participating State.</P>

<P>They will likewise in all circumstances refrain from any
other act of military, or of political, economic or other
coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the
exercise by another participating State of the rights inherent in
its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind.</P>

<P>Accordingly, they will, inter alia, refrain from direct or
indirect assistance to terrorist activities, or to subversive or
other activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the

universal and effective respect for them.</P>

<P>They confirm the right of the individual to know and act
upon his rights and duties in this field.</P>

and external political status, without external interference, and
to pursue as they wish their political, economic, social and
cultural development.</P>

Nations. In developing their co-operation the participating
States will place special emphasis on the fields as set forth
within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-
operation in Europe, with each of them making its contribution in
conditions of full equality.</P>

<P>They will endeavour, in developing their co-operation as
equals, to promote mutual understanding and confidence, friendly
and good-neighbourly relations among themselves, international
peace, security and justice. They will equally endeavour, in
developing their co-operation, to improve the well-being of
peoples and contribute to the fulfilment of their aspirations
through, inter alia, the benefits resulting from increased mutual
knowledge and from progress and achievement in the economic,
scientific, technological, social, cultural and humanitarian

<P>Taking into account considerations relevant to efforts aimed
at lessening tension and promoting disarmament;</P>

accordance with the following provisions:</P>

<P>Notification will be given of major military manoeuvres
exceeding a total of 25,000 troops, independently or combined
with any possible air or naval components (in this context the
word "troops" includes amphibious and airborne troops). In the
case of independent manoeuvres of amphibious or airborne troops,
or of combined manoeuvres involving them, these troops will be
included in this total. Furthermore, in the case of combined
manoeuvres which do not reach the above total but which involve
land forces together with significant numbers of either
amphibious or airborne troops, or both, notification can also be
given.</P>

<P>Notification will be given of major military manoeuvres
which take place on the territory, in Europe, of any
participating State as well as, if applicable, in the adjoining
sea area and air space.</P>

<P>In the case of a participating State whose territory extends
beyond Europe, prior notification need be given only of
manoeuvres which take place in an area within 250 kilometres from
its frontier facing or shared with any other European
participating State, the participating State need not, however,
give notification in cases in which that area is also contiguous
to the participating State's frontier facing or shared with a
non-European non-participating State.</P>

<P>Notification will be given 21 days or more in advance of the
start of the manoeuvre or in the case of a manoeuvre arranged at
shorter notice at the earliest possible opportunity prior to its

<P>Notification will contain information of the designation, if
any, the general purpose of and the States involved in the
manoeuvre, the type or types and numerical strength of the forces
engaged, the area and estimated time-frame of its conduct. The
participating States will also, if possible, provide additional

further to strengthening confidence and increasing security and
stability, and to this end may also notify smaller-scale military
manoeuvres to other participating States, with special regard for
those near the area of such manoeuvres.</P>

<P>To the same end, the participating States also recognize
that they may notify other military manoeuvres conducted by them.</P>

<H4><A NAME="H4.15">Exchange of observers</A></H4>

<P>The participating States will invite other participating
States, voluntarily and on a bilateral basis, in a spirit of
reciprocity and goodwill towards all participating States, to
send observers to attend military manoeuvres.</P>

<P>The inviting State will determine in each case the number of
observers, the procedures and conditions of their participation,

possible through usual diplomatic channels.</P>

<H4><A NAME="H4.16">Prior notification of major military movements</A></H4>

<P>In accordance with the Final Recommendations of the Helsinki
Consultations the participating States studied the question of
prior-notification of major military movements as a measure to
strengthen confidence.</P>

<P>Accordingly, the participating States recognize that they
may, at their own discretion and with a view to contributing to
confidence-building, notify their major military movements.</P>

<P>In the same spirit, further consideration will be given by
the States participating in the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe to the question of prior notification of
major military movements, bearing in mind, in particular, the
experience gained by the implementation of the measures which are
set forth in this document.</P>

objective of confidence/building, the participating States, when
conducting their military activities in the area covered by the
provisions for the prior notification of major military
manoeuvres, will duly take into account and respect this
objective.</P>

<P>They also recognize that the experience gained by the
implementation of the provisions set forth above, together with
further efforts, could lead to developing and enlarging measures
aimed at strengthening confidence.</P>

<P>The participating States recognize the interest of all of
them in efforts aimed at lessening military confrontation and
promoting disarmament which are designed to complement political
dtente in Europe and to strengthen their security. They areconvinced of the necessity to take effective measures in thesefields which by their scope and by their nature constitute steps
towards the ultimate achievement of general and complete
disarmament under strict and effective international control, and
which should result in strengthening peace and security
throughout the world.</P>

<H3><A NAME="H3.5">III General considerations</A></H3>

<P>Having considered the views expressed on various subjects
related to the strengthening of security in Europe through joint
efforts aimed at promoting dtente and disarmament, theparticipating States, when engaged in such efforts, will, in this
context, proceed, in particular, from the following essential
considerations:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The complementary nature of the political and military
aspects of security;
<LI>The interrelation between the security of each participating
State and security in Europe as a whole and the relationship
which exists, in the broader context of world security, between
security in Europe and security in the Mediterranean area;
<LI>Respect for the security interests of all States
participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe inherent in their sovereign equality;

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<H1>The North Atlantic Treaty</H1>
<H3>Washington D.C., April 4, 1949</H3>
The Parties to this Treaty reaffirm their faith in the
purposes and principles of the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/Overview/Charter/contents.html">Charter of the United Nations</A> and
their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all
governments.
<P>They are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage
and civilisation of their peoples, founded on the principles of
democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.
<P>They seek to promote stability and well-being in the North
Atlantic area.
<P>They are resolved to unite their efforts for collective
defence and for the preservation of peace and security.<BR>
They therefore agree to this North Atlantic Treaty:

<H4><A NAME="Art1">Article 1</A></H4>

The Parties undertake, as set forth in the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/Overview/Charter/contents.html">Charter of the United
Nations</A>, to settle any international dispute in which they may be
involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international
peace and security and justice are not endangered, and to refrain
in their international relations from the threat or use of force
in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United
Nations.

<H4><A NAME="Art2">Article 2</A></H4>

The Parties will contribute toward the further development of
peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening
their free institutions, by bringing about a better understanding
of the principles upon which these institutions are founded, and
by promoting conditions of stability and well-being. They will
seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic
policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any or
all of them.

<H4><A NAME="Art3">Article 3</A></H4>

In order more effectively to achieve the objectives of this
Treaty, the Parties, separately and jointly, by means of
continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, will maintain
and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist
armed attack.

<H4><A NAME="Art4">Article 4</A></H4>

The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any
of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or
security of any of the Parties is threatened

<H4><A NAME="Art5">Article 5</A></H4>

The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of
them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack
against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an
armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of
individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of
the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/Overview/Charter/contents.html">Charter of the United Nations</A>, will assist the Party or
Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in
concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems
necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and
maintain the security of the NorthAtlantic area.

<P>Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof
shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such
measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken
the measures necessary to restore and maintain inter-national
peace and security <A HREF="#Ft1">1</A>.

<H4><A NAME="Art6">Article 6</A></H4>

For the purpose of <A HREF="#Art5">Article 5</A>, an armed attack on one or more of
the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack:
<UL>
<LI>on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North
America, on the Algerian Departments of France, <A HREf="#Ft2">2</A> on the
territory of Turkey or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of
any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic
of Cancer;
<LI>on the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when
in or over these territories or any other area in Europe in which
occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the
date when the Treaty entered into force or theMediterranean Sea
or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="Art7">Article 7</A></H4>

This Treaty does not affect, and shall not be interpreted as
affecting in any way the rights and obligations under the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/Overview/Charter/contents.html">Charter
of the Parties which are members of the United Nations</A>, or the
primary responsibility of the Security Council for the
maintenance of international peace and security.

<H4><A NAME="Art8">Article 8</A></H4>

Each Party declares that none of the international engagements
now in force between it and any other of the Parties or any third
State is in conflict with theprovisions of this Treaty, and
undertakes not to enter into any international engagement in
conflict with this Treaty.

<H4><A NAME="Art9">Arlicle 9</A></H4>

The Parties hereby establish a Council, on which each of them
shall be represented, to consider matters concerning the
implementation of this Treaty. The Council shall be so organised
as to be able to meet promptly at any time. The Council shall set
up such subsidiary bodies as may be necessary; in particular it
shall establish immediately a defence committee which shall
recommend measures for the implementation of Articles
<A HREF="#Art3">3</A> and <A HREF="#Art5">5</A>.

<H4><A NAME="Art10">Article 10</A></H4>

The Parties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other
European State in a position to further the principles of this
Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic
area to accede to this Treaty. Any State so invited may become a
Party to the Treaty by depositing its instrument of accession
with the Government of the United States of America. The
Government of the United States of America will inform each of
the Parties of the deposit of each such instrument of accession.

<H4><A NAME="Art11">Article 11</A></H4>

This Treaty shall be ratified and its provisions carried out by
the Parties in accordance with their respective constitutional
processes. The instruments of ratification shall be deposited as
soon as possible with the Government of the United States of
America, which will notify all the other signatories of each
deposit. The Treaty shall enter into force between the States
which have ratified it as soon as the ratifications of the
majority of the signatories, including the ratifications of
Belgium, Canada, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United
Kingdom and the United States, have been deposited and shall come
into effect with respect to other States on the date of the
deposit of their ratifications.

<H4><A NAME="Art12">Article 12</A></H4>

After the Treaty has been in force for ten years, or at any time
thereafter, the Parties shall, if any of them so requests,
consult together for the purpose of reviewing the Treaty, having
regard for the factors then affecting peace and security in the
North Atlantic area, including the development of universal as
well as regional arrangements under the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/Overview/Charter/contents.html">Charter of the United
Nations</A> for the maintenance of international peace and security.

<H4><A NAME="Art13">Article 13</A></H4>

After the Treaty has been in force for twenty years, any Party
may cease to be a Party one year after its notice of denunciation
has been given to the Government of the United States of America,
which will inform the Governments of the other Parties of the
deposit of each notice of denunciation

<H4><A NAME="Art14">Article 14</A></H4>

This Treaty, of which the English and French texts are equally
authentic, shall be deposited in the archives of the Government
of the United States of America. Duly certified copies will be
transmitted by that Government to the Governments of other
signatories.

<LI><A NAME="Ft1"></A>The definition of the territories to which
<A HREF="#Art5">Article 5</A> applies
was revised by <A HREF="grturk.html#Art2">Article 2</A> of the
<A HREF="grturk.html">Protocol to the North Atlantic
Treaty on the accession of Greece and Turkey</A> and by the
Protocols signed on the accession of the Federal Republic of
Germany and of Spain.

<LI><A NAME="Ft2"></A>On January 16,1963, the North Atlantic Council heard a
declaration by the French Representative who recalled that by the
vote on self-determination on July 1, 1962, the Algerian people
had pronounced itself in favour of the independence of Algeria in
co-operation with France. In consequence, the President of the
French Republic had on July 1962, formally recognised the
independence of Algeria. The result was that the "Algerian
departments of France" no longer existed as such, and that at the
same time the fact that they were mentioned in the North Atlantic
Treaty had no longer any bearing. Following this statement the
Council noted that insofar as the former Algerian Departments of
France were concerned, the relevant clauses of this Treaty had
become inapplicable as from July 3, 1962.

from fear and want has beep proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common
people,</P>

last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights
should be protected by the rule of law,</P>

<P>Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations
between nations,</P>

<p>
<b>Political Relations</b>
<br>
Greece and the United States enjoy traditional close ties of friendship and cooperation in a wide field of bilateral activities, as well as in the international organizations in which they jointly participate.
<p>
During the last five years, additional mobility has been observed in the relations between the two countries since, among others, certain important outstanding matters have been settled, and both sides have affirmed their interest for the further strengthening of the ties between them. The new eight-year U.S.-Greek Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement, which was signed in September 1990 and has entered into effect, regulates defense relations between Greece and the United States on a mutually beneficial basis. At the same time, high level contacts between the two countries have continued via the exchange of visits, and cooperation was reinforced in the sensitive areas of terrorism and the war against drugs.
<p>
Cooperation during the Gulf war and throughout the Gulf crisis, as well as the de jure recognition of Israel by Greece, have further strengthened relations between Greece and the United States. At the same time, the large and financially robust Greek-American community in the States, which numbers 2 to 3 million Greek-Americans, maintains strong ties with Greece, shows great interest in issues of mutual concern to both countries, and has long established itself as a firm link of friendship and cooperation between them.
<p>
As is natural, relations between Greece and the United States do not solely involve, and are not solely affected by, bilateral issues. They are also influenced by developments in wider regional and international contexts. Thus, for example, the question of Turkey's illegal occupation of half of Cyprus (about which the U.S. administration has shown special interest), relations between Greece and Turkey, and other issues that arise in the wider Balkan region are all of vital concern to Greece, and at times can involve and affect U.S.-Greek relations.
<p>
Similarly, Greece both supports and actively participates in the Partnership for Peace initiative ("PFP"), together with the United States. In the PFP context, in May 1995 Greece organized a humanitarial multinational exercize in the Karditsa area named "NEW SPIRIT 95." This exercize was the first of its kind to take place in the Balkans. It involved personnel from Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and the United States. The different teams worked closely together in a scenario to meet the needs of populations hit by major earthquakes. The purpose of the exercize was to foster good will and the spirit of cooperative action among the countries involved for the execution of joint humanitarian missions in the Balkan region.
<p>
Greek -U.S. relations were further enhanced during the visits of Greek Prime Minister Mr. Simitis (working visit, April 7-10) and the President of the Republic Mr. Stephanopoulos (State visit, May 7-10) to the United States.
<p>
Both men discussed with President Clinton and members of the Administration all aspects of bilateral issues, the opportunities for economic cooperation in the Balkan area, Greek-Turkish relations, the Cyprus problem, and issues relating to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
<p>
It was stressed, on both sides, that international law and international treaties should be the basis of relations between Greece and Turkey, and that territorial claims should not be settled by force of the threat of force but through the International Court of Justice.
<p>
On the Cyprus problem, the importance of a just and viable solution was emphasized. President Clinton committed himself once more to work personally towards this goal.
<p>
A few days later (14-16 May, 1996) the annual High Level Consultative Committee meeting was held in Washington, where bilateral defense cooperation was reviewed.
<p>
Finally, the signing, on May 20, 1996, of the bilateral agreement regarding the status of the relay stations of the Voice of America in Greece offers, among other things, the chance to Greek-Americans to receive  programs of Greek national broadcasting in the United States.
<p>
<b>Economic-Commercial Relations</b>
<br>
The legal framework governing Greece's bilateral trade relations with the United States is the same one applicable to relations between the United States and all European Union member-states, i.e., the wider framework of the former General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, within the context of multilateral regulations of the newly-established World Trade Organization.
<p>
With the exception of the restrictions imposed by the United States on the importation of certain agricultural products (fresh and processed), there is full freedom of sale of Greek industrial products in the U.S. market. The EU-United States Agreement (Memorandum) of May 1993 provides Greek enterprises with additional possibilities of access to U.S. public contracts.
<p>
The principal Greek products exported to the United States are tobacco, petroleum products, cement, clothing articles, fur products, foods, marble, steel products, pipes, and refractory products. U.S. imports to Greece consist mainly of agricultural products and machinery, telecommunications equipment, electrical equipment, computers and electronic equipment, medical and pharmaceutical items, machinery and parts, skins, timber, and wood-pulp.
<p>
In the context of developing even closer economic cooperation between Greece and the United States, efforts are being advanced for promoting cooperation on a joint venture or subcontracting basis between American and Greek firms, for the execution of projects andinvestments and for the more efficient absorption of U.S. and Greek products in the markets of the Balkans, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. The implementation of such cooperation is sure to be further encouraged by the opportunity given to U.S. firms for state insurance of the business risk involved in investing in such areas as well as for financing.
<br>
<p>
<a name=can><font size=+1>Relations between Greece and Canada</a></font>
<p>
The traditionally close Greek-Canadian relations have been further strengthened within the framework of NATO and the OSCE.
<p>
The Greek-Canadian community in Canada is an important link of friendship between the two countries, numbering today approximately 250,000. Most members of this vibrant community are first-generation Greeks, which explains their strong interest in the national issues of Greece. 
<p>
Courses in Greek studies are being offered in several Canadian Universities. Greek-Canadians own a number of media enterprises throughout Canada. A great number of the Greeks of Canada are businessmen, doctors, lawyers, and university professors.
<br>
<p>
<a name=lat><font size=+1>Relations between Greece and Latin American countries</a></font>
<p>
<b>The Past</b>
<br>
In general, and in spite of the great geographical distance that separates Greece frrom Latin America, the climate in the relations of Greece with the countries of Latin America has been very positive. This is partly due to the fact there has never been an issue of conflict with any of our Latin American friends.
<p>
Furthermore, the Greek classical education is inherent in the education system of certain countries of Latin America and it is deeply appreciated. Finally, the cooperation of Cyprus with Latin American countries, in the framework of the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries, has had a positive impact on Grece as well. 
<p>
However, apart from this positive spirit in our relations, the presence of Greece in the area had been for years very limited (small number of diplomatic authorities, limited exchanges of visits between officials), with limited trade transactions and economic activity in general.
<p>
<b>The Present</b>
<br>
In August 1986, for the first time ever, a Greek Prime Minister visited Latin America in an official capacity. Then Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou visited Mexico in the framework of bilateral relations. Subsequently he participated in the Initiative for Peace sponsored by six world leaders (also attended by the Mexican and the Argentinean leaders).
<p>
In addition to Greece's embassies in Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina, in recent years a Greek embassy was established in Cuba, and later on in Uruguay, Chile, and Peru.
<p>
In the cultural domain, the Centre of Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, the only one of its kind present in Latin America, continues to operate successfully within the University of Santiago in Chile. 
<p>
<b>The Greeks of Latin America</b>
<br>
Vibrant Greek communities exist in almost all Latin American countries. The largest among those are in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, and Panama. Their contribution in the lives of their respective countries, as well as in the promotion of awareness of Greek national issues is significant. They also serve as a welcome bridge of mutual cultural awareness and cooperation between Greece and their respective countries.

<center> <h3> CHRONOLOGY <br>



Of Main Turkish Hostile Actions and Arbitrary Claims Against Greece  1955-1996 



</h3> </center>



<br>







<b> September 1955 </b> <br>



Orchestrated attack of Turkish mob against the Greek minority in Constantinople (Istanbul). Significant number of casualties and virtually total destruction of their properties. Beginning of massive exodus of minority from Constantinople (Istanbul). Reduction of its numbers from approximately 120,000 to 2,000 people today.



<p>



<b> 1958 </b> <br>



Decision to close down the Greek Union of Constantinople, effective immediately.



<p>



<b> 1964 </b> <br>



Unilateral Turkish denunciation of the Convention of Establishment of Commerce and Navigation of 1930 (between Venizelos and Ataturk). Greek citizens immediately forced to leave Turkey. Obligation for the expedited departure of their relatives, minority-member Turkish citizens.







Issuance of secret law denying Greek citizens all their property rights in Turkey.



<p>



<b> 1964 </b> <br>



Shutting down of all minority schools on the islands of Imbros and Tenedos. Establishment on islands of Turkish jails for heavy criminals, expropriation of properties of the Greek population, consequent fleeing of the Greek minority from the islands. Reduction of minority population from 8,000 to 250 people today.



<p>



<b> 1971 </b> <br>



Decision of the Turkish authorities to shut down the Halki Theological School, immediately executable. Consequent  deprival of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of its sole means for acquiring new members. 



<p>



<b> 1973-74 </b> <br>



De facto questioning of Greece's sovereign rights over the Aegean continental shelf, through the granting of research licenses to the Turkish government petroleum company (TRAO) and the sending of the research vessel "CARDALI" to conduct research in the area.



<p>



<b> 1974 </b> <br>



Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Occupation of 37 percent of the area of the Democracy of Cyprus. One-third of the Cypriot population (180,000-200,000 people) become refugees. Maintenance of Turkish military force of 30,000-35,000 soldiers in occupied areas. Transfer to the occupied areas of approximately 70,000 Turkish settlers from Anatolia.  



<p>



<b> 1974 </b> <br>



De facto questioning of Greek air space of 10 n.m., for the first time since 1931. Continuous and massive violations of Greek air space (over 500 in 1995 alone). Over 80 percent of violations occur at less than 6 n.m. from the Greek coast and even over the Greek islands. De facto arbitrary rejection by Turkey of F.I.R. Athens (until 1980).



<p>



<b> 1968-82 </b> <br>



Throughout the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, Turkey systematically attempts to deprive islands of the rights enjoyed by all countries in their sea space (territorial waters, continental shelf, economic zone, etc.). Turkish efforts are rejected.



<p>



<b> 1975 </b> <br>



Turkey agrees to the referral of the continental shelf dispute to the International Court of Justice (joint statement of Prime Ministers Karamanlis and Demirel in Brussels). Subsequently pulls back from agreement and insists on dialogue for the "political" solution of the dispute (in other words, for the division or the joint utilization of the Aegean continental shelf).



<p>



<b> 1975-today </b> <br>



Repeated statements by officials in all levels of Turkish government that Greece's potential extension of her territorial waters to 12 n.m. -- as is her legal right under the Law of the Sea Convention -- or actions concerning other Greek sovereign rights would constitute a "casus belli."



<br>



Constant questioning of Greece's sovereignty over the Aegean islands (Lausane Treaty of 1923, Paris Peace Treaty of 1947) on several unfounded pretexts (historical, geopolitical, etc.).



<p>



<b> 1974-80 </b> <br>



Greece temporarily not member of NATO military leg. Since her return in 1980, Turkey consistently attempts to prevent Greece's full re-entry, through use of the Turkish veto (military planning, joint infrastructure projects, establishment of NATO headquarters in Greece). Since 1992, Turkey refuses to agree to the implementation of NATO decisions for the establishment of two allied headquarters in Greece. It also blocks decision on the establishment in Greece of MND South.



<p>



<b> 1989 </b> <br>



Passage of arbitrary Turkish law establishing Turkish "Search and Rescue" rights over half of the Aegean, in direct violation of ICAO rules.



<p>



<b> 1993 </b> <br>



Arbitrary Turkish regulation regarding navigation through the Straits, in violation of the Montreux Convention (1936).



<p>



<b> 1995-96 </b> <br>



For the first time in recent history, Turkey claims sovereignty over Greek territory (Imia islets and, by extension, the Dodecanese islands), both through hostile military actions and through the questioning of the validity and binding force of international treaties and agreements that establish the territorial status quo in the Aegean.

<LI> <a href="#g"> Conclusion </a> 
</UL>  <p> <br> 
The only legitimate dispute that needs to be settled between Greece and Turkey in the 
Aegean is the delimitation of the Aegean continental shelf. On this topic, Greece has 
repeatedly invited Turkey to the negotiation table in order for the two sides to agree to a 
compromis for the referral of the dispute to the International Court of Justice. Turkey has 
repeatedly turned down Greece's invitation. 
<p> 
Beyond this, all other matters at times termed "Aegean disputes" by Turkey consist 
exclusively of arbitrary claims against Greek sovereignty put forth by Turkey in defiance of 
international law and agreements. 
<p> 
This Turkish practice has created great tension in the relations between Greece and Turkey. 
It has prevented the establishment of a long-lasting friendship between the two countries, 
which has always been -- and remains -- Greece's hope and goal. Peace, stability, and respect 
for international law are the only ways to ensure the necessary prosperity of Greece and 
Turkey and of their peoples, who have lived as neighbors and will continue to do so for 
centuries to come.  
<p> <br> 
<a name="a"> <h4> A. Delimitation of the Continental Shelf </h4> </a> 
<br> 
This problem came to the forefront for the first time in November 1, 1973. On that date, the 
Turkish government published in the official Turkish Government Gazette a map that 
arbitrarily designated areas of the Aegean -- including Greek areas -- for which the 
government of Ankara had issued a license permitting research activities on the part of the 
Turkish Petroleum Company. 
<p> 
The subsequent tension reached its peak in 1974 and again in 1976, when the Turkish 
Oceanographic research vessels "Candarli" and "Hora" sailed into the Aegean for the purpose 
of carrying out research activities on the seabed just outside the territorial waters of the 
Greek islands. 
<p> 
With respect to the delimitation of the Continental Shelf, three basic differences exist 
between Greece and Turkey. These concern: (a) the nature of the problem; (b) the right of 
islands to  their own Continental Shelf; and  (c) the applicable provisions of International 
Law to the case. 
<p> 
<b> a. </b>The nature of the problem  
<br> 
Turkey asserts that the difference to be settled concerns the partition of the entire Aegean 
Continental Shelf, and claims that Turkey should acquire areas of Continental Shelf west of 
the Greek islands up to the middle of the Aegean. Viewed in this light, the question loses its 
legal character and becomes purely political, as it would have to be settled without 
reference to International Law and practice, which do not support Turkey's aspirations. 
<p> 
Greece, on the contrary, emphasizes that the matter to be settled consists exclusively of the 
legal delimitation of the Continental Shelf between the two countries, i.e., from the Thracian 
border to the islands of the Northern and Eastern Aegean and the Dodecanese. In other 
words, Greece believes that the question is a legal one, to be resolved in accordance with 
International Law and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations for the resolution 
of international legal disputes. 
<p> 
<b> b. </b> The right of islands to their own continental shelf.  
<br> 
Turkey does not recognize that islands are entitled to a continental shelf of their own. 
Instead, it wishes to carve a line of partition down the middle of the Aegean, as if there 
were no islands at all in the area. 
<p> 
Greece holds that the islands have full rights to the continental shelf under International 
Law. Greece cites, among other things, to the Geneva Convention of 1958, the Convention on 
the Law of the Sea 1982, and the 1969 decision of the International Court of Justice 
concerning the delimitation of the continental shelf of the North Sea.  
<p> 
All three documents establish that islands possess their own continental shelf, both pursuant 
to international treaties and under customary international law. 
<p> 
Turkey's assertion that all the islands of the Aegean are somehow "special cases" enjoying 
fewer rights than others is therefore unfounded in International Law. Indeed, the fact that 
the Greek islands of the Aegean number nearly 3.000 and constitute a continuous chain 
from the Greek mainland to the Turkish coast renders irrational any attempt to ignore their 
existence in this respect. 
<p> 
<b> c. </b> The legal principles to be applied to the resolution of the question. 
<br> 
Turkey invokes the principle of "equity." However, Turkey does not interpret this principle 
in accordance with International Law. Instead, she gives her own arbitrary interpretation to 
the notion of "equity," using criteria of a political nature that appear to be selected in order 
to further non-legal expansionist designs in the Aegean.  
<p> 
Greece affirms that, for the delimitation of the Continental Shelf, the applicable principle 
under International Law is that of the median line. This principle is foreseen by article 6 of 
the Geneva Convention of 1958, and is widely recognized as the basic principle of 
International Law in such cases. 
<p> 
There is little doubt that, if Turkey aimed solely at the delimitation of the Continental 
Shelf, and not at the entrapment of the Greek islands of the Eastern Aegean within an area 
of Turkish jurisdiction, then the matter would already have been peacefully settled. 
Specifically, Turkey could have presented herself before the International Court of Justice 
in 1976, when Greece laid the matter before it. However, due to the refusal of Turkey to 
accept the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court declared lack of jurisdiction to decide the 
matter. 
<p> 
Concerning subsequent developments, the following points should be borne in mind: 
<br> 
In 1976, after a peak in the tension in the Aegean, Greece and Turkey engaged in 
negotiations at Berne, which resulted in a sort of "modus vivendi" between the two sides. A 
protocol was signed in Berne on 11 November 1976, fixing a code of conduct to govern 
future negotiations concerning the delimitation of the Continental Shelf in the Aegean. 
<p> 
No tangible result was reached, however, and the matter remained unresolved until March 
1987, when a new crisis led to the brink of hostilities.  
<p> 
This new crisis was provoked by Turkey, when she sent the oceanographic research vessel 
"Sismik-I," escorted by Turkish warships, into the Aegean in order to engage in research 
activities on the seabed just outside the territorial waters of the Greek islands. 
<p> 
Subsequently, in letters exchanged between the Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey, 
Greece reiterated her position concerning the delimitation of the Continental Shelf,  the 
cornerstone of which is that the matter should be settled through recourse to the 
International Court of Justice. This position remains unaltered to this day, as does Turkey's 
refusal to submit her claims to the judgment of the Court. 
<p> <br> 
<a name="b"> <h4> B. Aegean Territorial Waters</h4></a> 
<br> 
Apart from the issue of the delimitation of the Continental Shelf, Turkey has chosen to 
create tension on a number of other issues in the Aegean, principal among which is the 
breadth of Greek territorial waters. Turkey puts forth no legal arguments in this matter. 
Indeed, the only argument used by Turkey to support her claims in this regard is the explicit 
and repeated use of the threat of war against Greece. 
<p> 
<b> a. </b> Greek territorial waters were fixed by law in 1936 at 6 nautical miles from the 
Greek coast line. 
<br> 
Even earlier, however, in 1931, the breadth of Greek national airspace was fixed at a breadth 
of 10 n.m. 
<p> 
The <a href="gopher://un.org:70/11/LOS/UNCLOS82">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,</a> which recently entered into force, 
explicitly recognizes that every coastal state has the right of territorial waters to an outer 
limit of 12 n.m., including for its islands. Immediately thereafter, former Turkish Prime 
Minister Ciller repeated in the most official manner the threat that any attempt by Greece 
to apply the Law of the Sea Convention with respect to Greek territorial waters would 
constitute a casus belli. 
<p> 
It should be noted that the right to territorial waters of 12 n.m. has been exercised by the 
vast majority of coastal states throughout the world, including Turkey herself. In 1964, 
Turkey extended her territorial waters in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Nevertheless, 
in response to the Greek Parliament's ratification of the LoS Convention on 31 May 1995, the 
Turkish National Assembly, on 8 June 1995, unanimously adopted a resolution that gave the 
Turkish government all powers, including military ones, for the "protection" of Turkish vital 
"interests," in the event that Greece ever exercised her internationally established rights. 
<p> 
This threat of war on the part of Turkey violates article 2 paragraph 4 of the United 
Nations Charter, which forbids all member - states to use force or the threat of the use of 
force in international relations. 
<p> 
Remarkably, Turkey's blatantly illegal act was endorsed by the Turkish Permanent 
Representative to the United Nations in a June 13, 1995 letter addressed to the U.N. Secretary 
General. That letter adopted and even attempted to justify the Resolution of the Turkish 
National Assembly. It thus made clear that the Turkish government's official policy is in 
full alignment with the contents of this illegal resolution. 
<p> 
In this matter the Greek position is clear-cut, supported by international law, and not subject 
to Turkish threats. International Law gives Greece the right to extend her territorial waters 
up to 12 n.m. Greece has stated that it intends to exercise this right whenever she deems fit 
to do so. 
<p> 
<b> b. </b> Concerning Greek national airspace, it should be noted that, until 1975 -- that is to 
say, for 44 years -- Turkey never once challenged the breadth of 10 n.m. On the contrary, 
she recognized and respected it in practice.  
<p> 
Since 1975 however, Turkey ceased to do so, and Turkish warplanes have regularly violated 
Greek national airspace on an ever increasing basis. It should be noted that, during the last 
three years in particular, the number of violations has sky-rocketed, not only between 6 and 
10 n.m. from the Greek coast but frequently below 6 n.m., and often even over Greek island 
territory. 
<p> 
When Greece protests against these violations, Turkey typically replies that she does not 
consider that her aircraft flying between 6 and 10 n.m. from the Greek coasts violate Greek 
airspace. Greek aircraft are forced to intercept all Turkish warplanes that violate Greek 
national airspace.  
<p> 
As a consequence, Turkey's violations bring with them the daily threat of instability in the 
region. 
<br> 
It is not coincidental that Turkey "discovered" her claims with respect to Greek national air-
space in 1975, the year she first began to push her claims to the Aegean continental shelf in 
earnest. Clearly, Turkey wishes to limit Greek sovereign rights in the whole of the Aegean, 
in contravention of international law.  
<p> <br> 
<a name="c"> <h4>C. The Athens Flight Information Region (FIR Athens)</h4></a> 
<br> 
On December 7, 1944, the Civil Aviation Convention was signed in Chicago. It foresaw the 
creation of an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Each member-state would 
be assigned an area of responsibility for the control of all air-traffic. 
<br> 
The Athens Flight Information Region ("FIR") was agreed to at the Regional Air-Traffic 
Conferences of 1950, 1952, and 1958. 
<p> 
Turkey participated in all these conferences and had fully accepted the boundaries of 
Greece's FIR. The Athens FIR covers Greek national air-space in its entirety, as well as 
certain areas of international air-space. In accordance with the ICAO regulations and with 
international practice, all aircraft, civil and military alike, must submit proper notification 
before crossing the FIR. 
<p> 
Nevertheless, in August 1974, Turkey arbitrarily issued NOTAM 714 (Notice to Air-men) by 
which she unilaterally extended her area of responsibility up to the middle of the Aegean, 
within the Athens FIR. Greece then had to declare that part of the Aegean a dangerous area 
(NOTAM 1157). The ICAO addressed an appeal to both countries to put an end to the 
situation, without success at the time. 
<p> 
Finally, in 1980, Ankara withdrew NOTAM 714, when she realized that it was prejudicial to 
her interests and especially to her tourist industry. 
<p> 
Nevertheless, Turkey continues to violate the Athens FIR with her military aircraft under 
the pretext that the Chicago Convention does not concern military aircraft. 
<p> 
The Greek position is that the regulations and decisions of the ICAO must be fully 
respected. Furthermore, reasons of safety of international air-traffic demand that Turkish 
warplanes submit flight plans when entering the Athens FIR. 
<p> 
Once again, it is perhaps no coincidence that the difficulties created by Turkey concerning 
the Flight Information Region began in 1974, after the Cyprus invasion, when Turkey turned 
her full attention to the Aegean. The Turkish claims are unfounded and serve only to 
further Turkish designs of control over the Aegean. 
<p> <br> 
<a name="d"> <h4>D. Search and Rescue within the Athens FIR</h4></a> 
<br> 
The Greek area of responsibility for search and rescue (SAR) operations in case of air-
traffic accidents coincides with the Athens FIR. It was fixed decades ago according to the 
relevant Annex of the Chicago Convention for Civil Aviation of 1944. 
<p> 
In the case of maritime accidents, the area of jurisdiction is fixed by the Hamburg 
Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue of 1979. Greece has ratified this convention, 
specifying that she would conduct maritime search and rescue operations in the whole of 
the Athens FIR. This reflects the geographical and political realities of the area and allows 
for the most efficient rendering of services for the safeguarding of human life in case of 
maritime accidents. 
<p> 
Turkey, on her part, published in the Turkish Government Gazette on January 7, 1989,  the 
Turkish Code for Search and Rescue Operations. That Code arbitrarily fixed the Turkish 
SAR area of responsibility for air and maritime accidents in such a way as to include a large 
part of the Black Sea, half of the Aegean, and a part of the Eastern Mediterranean, which 
included the occupied part of Cyprus. 
<p> 
Once again, Turkey's goal to undermine the established status quo in the Aegean is more 
than evident. 
<p> 
Despite Turkey's efforts, on 7 March 1989, the International Civil Aviation Organization 
assured Greece that the responsibilities of Greece and Turkey concerning air and sea search 
and rescue operations remain unchanged, as they had been fixed and agreed upon for 
decades. 
<p> <br> 
<a name="e"> <h4>E. Turkey's Claims Concerning the Demilitarization of the Islands of the  
Eastern Aegean</h4></a> 
<br> 
Turkey is the only country that demands that the Greek islands of the Eastern Aegean be 
demilitarized without exception. This is in spite of the fact that Turkey never became part 
of the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947, which also concerned the status of the Dodecanese islands, 
as she had chosen to keep a stance of "neutrality" during World War II and not to fight on 
the side of the allied powers. 
<p> 
Contrary to Turkey's assertions, the militarization of the islands of the Eastern Aegean falls 
into three distinct categories: 
<OL> 
<LI> The right to install military forces on the islands of Limnos and Samothrake has been 
established by the Treaty of Montreux of 1936, and has repeatedly been recognized by 
Turkey (see, e.g., statement made by former Turkish Foreign Minister Rusdi Aras to the 
Turkish National Assembly on July 31, 1936; letter of former Turkish Ambassador in Athens 
to the Greek government dated May 6, 1936). 
 
<LI> Concerning Lesvos, Chios, Samos, and Ikaria, the Treaty of Lausanne imposed partial 
demilitarization of these islands and not total demilitarization, as Turkey claims. On the 
contrary, the presence of some military forces is foreseen, and Greece does indeed maintain 
a military presence on these islands in light of the need to protect her eastern frontier. 
 
<LI> For the same reasons, Greece maintains in the Dodecanese a certain number of National 
Guard units which have been registered within the framework of  the Treaty for 
Conventional Forces in Europe. 
</OL> 
<I> Apart from the above, Article 51 of the United Nations Charter foresees that every 
country has the inalienable right of legitimate defense of her territory. Unfortunately, the 
exercise of this right is particularly applicable and necessary in the case of Greece, given: 
<UL> 
<LI> the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 
<LI> arbitrary Turkish claims and hostile declarations and actions concerning the territorial 
integrity of the Greek islands for over two decades 
<LI> the formation by Turkey of the 4th Army Group of the Aegean, which is stationed 
exactly opposite the Greek islands, and is equipped with the largest fleet of landing-craft in 
the Mediterranean 
<LI> the recent Turkish attack on the Imia islets and Turkey's threats of "casus belli" if <I> 
Greece exercises her internationally recognized sovereign rights. </I> 
</UL> </I> 
The right of legitimate defense, one of the fundamental rights of the international legal 
order, possesses the character jus cogens. Article 103 of the U. N. Charter states that the 
right of legitimate defense contained in article 51 overrides any conventional obligation to 
the contrary. 
<p> 
Turkey cannot threaten Greece with war over Greek sovereign rights and then demand that 
Greece unilaterally disarm itself. 
<p> <br> 
<a name="f"><h4>F. Turkish Regulations Concerning Maritime Traffic Through the 
Straits</h4></a> 
<br> 
Since July 1, 1994, Turkey has begun to enforce a national code of regulations that attempts 
to regulate maritime traffic through the Straits. 
<p> 
However, transit through the Straits is governed by the Montreux Convention of 1936, and it 
cannot be substituted by the internal legislation of any one country. The Turkish Code 
contravenes the Montreux Convention, International Law, and the Recommendations of the 
International Maritime Organization made in May 1994, which Turkey ignored, although she 
had undertaken the obligation to harmonize her internal legislation with them. 
<p> 
Turkey  claims that the increase in maritime traffic through the Straits has heightened the 
dangers to the environment in the area, allegedly forcing her to take measures for its 
protection. 
<p> 
If this is really the case, however, Turkey should bring the matter for discussion at the 
International Maritime Organization and should request that the International Community 
take the appropriate steps. In any case, Turkey is not entitled to attempt to overthrow the 
Montreux Convention unilaterally. The Legal Committee of the International Maritime 
Organization stated as much in its meeting in October 1994. 
<p> 
Turkey, however, instead of modifying the code of regulations, merely published a set of 
directives concerning the implementation of the said Code. 
<p> 
During its last meeting, the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC 65) of the International 
Maritime Organization adopted the following conclusions put forward by its president: 
<UL> 
<LI> A reference was made to SN/Circular/66, according to which the regulations and 
recommendations of IMO aimed at the protection of the environment and did not influence 
the rights of ships passing through the Straits, as these are foreseen by International Law, 
including the International Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982 and the Montreux 
Convention of 1936. Furthermore, the Turkish Code of Regulations must conform to the 
regulations and recommendations of the IMO. 
<LI> A recommendation should be made to governments and International Organizations 
that, if questions should arise concerning technical issues related to the passage through the 
Straits, then the competent body to which they should be submitted is the Sub-committee of 
the IMO. 
<LI> The ships that navigate through the Straits must respect the regulations and 
recommendations of the IMO and the rules of International Law. 
</UL> 
The 19th Plenary Session of the IMO (November 1995) adopted the regulations and 
recommendations for maritime traffic through the Straits that were agreed at previous 
MSCs. It confirmed that these regulations and recommendations aim at the protection of 
maritime traffic and the environment in the area of the Straits, and that the Turkish Code 
of Regulations must be in full compliance with them. 
<p> 
As a result of an initiative on the part of the Russian delegation, the Committee on 
Maritime Safety was assigned to follow the matter of the Turkish Code of Regulations. 
Turkey differentiated her position on the matter.  
<p> <br> 
<a name="g"> <h4>Conclusion</h4></a> 
<br> 
The issues discussed above are all inter-linked. Turkey's principle aim appears to be to 
partition the Continental Shelf in order to exploit the natural resources of the Aegean 
seabed, as well as to enclose the islands of the Eastern Aegean in an area of Turkish 
jurisdiction that will facilitate her claims in the area.  
<p> 
Given this underlying goal, Turkey has "discovered" problems concerning the breadth of 
Greek national airspace, the width of Greek territorial waters, the Athens Flight 
Information Region, and many others. All these "problems," when tied together as part of an 
allegedly "inseparable" package of Turkish demands, make clear Turkey's design to usurp 
control of the resources of the Aegean and the sovereignty of the Greek islands.  
<p> 
In this context, Greece cannot ignore the chilling recent statement of former Turkish Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller in the aftermath of the latest crisis over the Imia rocks, that she 
disputes Greek sovereignty over 3.000 islands in the Aegean (which is to say, over more 
islands than the whole Aegean actually contains). 
<p> 
By challenging the internationally established status quo in the area, Turkey becomes a 
major factor of political, military, and economic instability in the entire region.

<A NAME="A"> <STRONG> Introduction </STRONG> </A> <P>  
International treaties and agreements dating back to 1923 establish unequivocally that the  
Imia rocky islets constitute an integral part of Greek sovereign territory.  
<P>  
The fact that the tension caused by the recent Turkish claims to the Imia rocks did not 
erupt  
into immediate conflict does not in the least mean that the danger has receded. On the  
contrary, Turkey, through its former Prime Minister's explicit threat to use military force  
against Greece, continues to press claims that are unfounded both in international law and in  
the established practice of civilized relations among nations.  
<P>  
This recent crisis was particularly serious because Turkey's principal argument  establishing  
her claim to these islets is that the International Treaties that set down the territorial status 
of  
the southeastern Aegean are not necessarily binding on Turkey. By questioning the  
sovereignty of the Imia rocks Turkey thus seeks to overthrow the territorial status of the  
entire region.  
<P>  
At the same time, Turkey has consistently refused to support the  assertions she has  
suddenly put forward  through peaceful and legal avenues, by bringing them to the  
International Court of Justice, as both Greece, a number of European Union countries, and  
the United States have repeatedly suggested.   
<P>  
As will be seen in greater detail in the following paragraphs, the Imia rocks have been under  
Greek sovereignty since the signing of the Paris Peace Treaty with Italy in  1947. For half a  
century Turkey did not raise any questions concerning the status of the islets and rocks.  
Unfortunately, the reason she does so now falls within the well-documented pattern of 
illegal  
Turkish intentions and actions over the past twenty years.  
<P>  
More specifically, in 1974, Turkey invaded and occupied Cyprus in defiance of international  
law and in the face of the indignation of the international community, as expressed in  
numerous resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United  
Nations.   
<P>  
At the same time, she turned her sights to the rest of the Aegean, by setting up the so-called  
"Army of the Aegean," a overtly  offensive military force equipped with the largest fleet of  
landing craft in the Mediterranean. Turkey also raised claims against Greek sovereign rights  
concerning the  continental shelf, control of the air-space of the area, as well as Greece's  
right, as established in international law, to extend her territorial waters up to 12 n.m.   
<P>  
In June of last year, the Turkish Parliament passed an unprecedented resolution authorizing  
the Turkish government to use all means, including military ones, should Greece exercise her  
legitimate rights concerning the extension of her territorial waters.  
<P>  
Turkey also challenges Greece's national air-space, backing up her claims by frequent and at  
times massive violations of the air-space by her military aircraft.  
<P>  
Unfortunately, the threat of the use of military force seems to be an integral part of 
Turkish  
foreign policy. Just as in the case of the territorial waters, during the Imia incident Turkey  
brandished the threat of war in order to impose her objectives, declaring that any attempt to  
question self-proclaimed "Turkish sovereignty" would constitute a causus belli.  
<P>  
These actions, encouraged - at least initially - by the lack of any firm reaction on the part 
of  
the international community, have now been proven to be part of Turkey's design to 
question  
Greece's internationally established rights in the Aegean, and to usurp sovereignty of at least  
half of the Aegean, by officially rejecting the established legal status quo.   
<P>  
If Turkey's attempts to question the binding force of international agreements were valid, 
then  
the majority of the treaties regulating international frontiers after the First and Second 
World  
Wars would collapse.    
<P>  
<A NAME="B"> <STRONG> The Crisis </STRONG> </A> <P>  
On the 25th of December 1995, the Turkish Cargo boat "Figen Akat" ran aground on one of  
the Imia rocks, situated 2,5 miles from the Greek island of Kalolimnos. Although the 
accident  
occurred in Greek territorial waters, the captain of the "Figen Akat" refused assistance from  
the competent Greek authorities, claiming that he was within Turkish territorial waters.  
Despite assurances to the contrary, the captain sought assistance from the Turkish  
authorities   
<P>  
Finally, in agreement with the Turkish company that owned the ship, the "Figen Akat" was 
set  
free with the aid of a Greek tug boat, owned by the company Matsas Star, and towed to the  
Turkish port of Gulluk.   
<P>  
On the 29th of December, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs addressed a Verbal Note 
to  
the Embassy of Greece in Ankara, asserting for the first time that Imia constitutes a part of  
Turkish territory, as it was registered in the land registry of the Turkish province of Mugla. 
It  
should be noted that this was the first time that Turkey openly laid claims over actual 
Greek  
territory.  
<P>  
In response to Turkey's claims, on the 10th of January 1996, the Greek Embassy addressed  
a Verbal Note to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In that Note the Turkish claim to 
the  
islets was rejected. The Note underlined the fact that Turkey had reaffirmed Imia as 
belonging  
to Italy by virtue of a bilateral agreement signed between the two countries in 1932, and that  
the islets were subsequently ceded to Greece with the rest of  the Dodecanese island chain  
by the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947.  
<P>  
Turkey then addressed a second Verbal Note to Greece on the 29th of January 1996,  
wherein the initial claim was repeated and extended with the request for negotiations  
concerning the status of all the islands, islets and rocks whose status, according to Turkey, is  
not well determined.  
<P>  
In response Greece addressed a Verbal Note to Turkey on February 16, 1996. In that Note  
Greece presented international legal documents and other facts establishing unequivocally  
the territorial status of all islands, islets and rocks in the Aegean. Greece emphasized that no  
country, including Turkey, had ever challenged that status in the past. The Note concluded  
that, as is only natural, Greece would not negotiate with Turkey matters pertaining to its  
territorial sovereignty as established by international law and treaties.  
 <P>  
The tension over Imia began to escalate on the 27th of January, when Turkish journalists  
from the newspaper Hurriyet took down the Greek flag from the larger of the two Imia 
islets  
and raised the Turkish one. On the 28th of January a Greek navy detachment replaced the  
Greek flag.   
<P>  
Initially, there were no naval units in the area except one Greek unit and a Turkish torpedo  
boat. On January 30, however, Turkey sent several ships to the area, prompting Greece to  
send an equal number. A Turkish frigate violated Greek territorial waters targeting a Greek  
gunboat that was patrolling the area. A Turkish helicopter taking off from one of the 
Turkish  
frigates flew over the Imia rocks. At the same time, Turkish warplanes repeatedly violated  
Greek airspace.  
<P>  
The tension reached its peak in the early morning hours of January 31, when the Turkish  
army landed some men on the smaller of the Imia rocks. An American mediation effort had  
already been initiated by means of repeated telephone contacts between President Clinton  
and Prime Minister Simitis, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Under Secretary  
Hobrooke with Foreign Minister Pangalos, and the Ministers of Defense Arsenis and Perry.   
<P>  
After a special session of the Government's National Security Council in the early hours of  
January 31, the Ministers of Defense and Foreign Affairs announced that an understanding  
had been reached by means of American mediation. Both sides would withdraw their forces  
from the area of Imia and the situation would return to its previous condition (the "status 
quo  
ante").   
<P>  
<A NAME="C"> <STRONG> The Legal Status of Imia </STRONG> </A> <P>  
<a href="imiamap"> The Imia islets </a> lie at a distance of 1.9 nautical miles from the Greek  
island of Kalolimnos, 5.3 n.m. from the Greek island of Kalymnos, 3.65 n.m. from the 
Turkish  
coast and 2.3 n.m. from the Turkish island of Cavus (formerly Kato). Like the rest of the  
Dodecanese island chain, they were ceded to Italy by virtue of article 15 of the Lausanne  
Peace Treaty of 1923.  
<P>  
At least three international agreements establish unambiguously Greece's ownership of Imia.   
<P>  
The first is the 1923 Lausanne Peace Treaty, which limits Turkish sovereignty -- with the  
exception of Imbros, Tenedos and the Rabbit islands -- explicitly only over islands lying 
within  
a three-mile limit off the Turkish coast (Article 12). As noted above, however, Imia are 3.65  
n.m. off the Turkish coast. Under Article 16 of the same Peace Treaty, Turkey "renounces all  
rights and title whatsoever over or respecting the territories situated outside the frontiers 
laid  
down in the present Treaty and the islands other than those over which her sovereignty is  
recognised by the said Treaty, the future of these territories and islands being settled or to 
be  
settled by the parties concerned."  
<P>  
The second is the January 4, 1932 Agreement between Italy and Turkey and its  
supplementary agreement of December 28, 1932. More specifically, the January 4  
Agreement set down with precision the maritime frontier between the island of Castellorizo  
and the Turkish coast. The day this Agreement was signed, the two parties exchanged 
official  
letters by which they mutually asserted that there was no  difference between them as to 
their  
respective territorial sovereignty, and called for a joint Italo-Turkish technical committee to 
be  
set up for the purpose of precisely delimiting the rest of the maritime boundary between 
the  
Dodecanese and the Turkish coast.   
<P>  
In accordance with this Agreement, the representatives of Italy and Turkey signed in 
Ankara,  
on December 28, 1932, a supplementary agreement by which the rest of the maritime 
frontier  
between the Dodecanese and the Turkish coast was precisely delimited. The agreement fixes  
37 pairs of reference points between which the maritime boundary dividing Turkish and 
Italian  
territory (which, at the time, included the Aegean Dodecanese islands) was drawn.  
<P>  
Point 30 of this agreement states that the maritime frontier north of Kalymnos will pass at a  
median distance between the Imia rocks (on the Italian side) and Kato island (on the Turkish  
side). Thus, Italian sovereignty over Imia is confirmed by the explicit reference made to 
them  
in the text itself.  
<P>  
The third international agreement was the Paris Treaty of 1947, signed between Italy and the  
Allied Powers after the conclusion of World War II. In that treaty Italy ceded the 
Dodecanese  
islands and all adjacent islets to Greece. As is well known, under international law, the  
successor state automatically assumes all the rights and obligations that have been  
established by international treaty between the initial possessor state and every third party 
(in  
this case, between Italy and Turkey).  
<P>  
<A NAME="D"> <STRONG> The Reaction of the European Parliament </STRONG> </A>  
<P>  
The European Parliament, on February 15, 1996, adopted a resolution entitled <a  
href="europ.htm">  "On the Provocative Actions and Contestation of Sovereign Rights by  
Turkey Against a Member State of the Union" </a> by an overwhelming 342 to 21 majority. 
In  
that resolution the Parliament found that "the islet of Imia belongs to the Dodecanese group 
of  
islands" pursuant to the 1923, 1932 and 1947 treaties. The Parliament also condemned "the  
dangerous violation by Turkey of the sovereign rights of Greece," and called on Turkey to  
comply "with international treaties" and to abstain from non-peaceful actions or threats of  
such actions.   
<P>  
It should be noted that the Parliament, a few months earlier, had ratified the Customs Union  
agreement between Turkey and the EU. It should further be noted that the Common 
Position  
of the Council, set out at the EU-Turkey Association Council meeting of March 6, 1995, 
stated  
that it was "of paramount importance to encourage good neighborly relations between  
Turkey and its neighboring Member States of the EU." The Parliament, in its February 16,  
1996 resolution, emphasized that "these privileged relations between the Union and Turkey  
should automatically preclude any military aggression."  
<P>  
<A NAME="E"> <STRONG> The International Court of Justice </STRONG> </A> <P>  
After the crisis, the U.S. administration suggested that Turkey's Imia claims be taken for  
peaceful resolution to the International Court of Justice.  
<P>  
Similarly, on February 26, 1996, the Italian Presidency of the European Union issued the  
summary of discussions that took place that day among the EU's fifteen Foreign Ministers 
on  
the issue of Imia. In that announcement the Presidency, among other things, emphasized that  
"territorial disputes must be resolved only through recourse to Law, that is to say, by the  
International Court of Justice."    
<P>  
Turkey immediately turned down both appeals. In contrast, from the beginning of the crisis  
Greece has stated that it would consider such an adjudication should Turkey, which is the  
party raising the territorial claims in the present instance, where to apply to the Court.  
<P>  
It should be noted that, unlike Greece, Turkey has not yet accepted the jurisdiction of the 
ICJ.  
<P>  
<A NAME="F"> <STRONG> Turkey's Legal Assertions </STRONG> </A> <P>  
The principal argument on which Turkey bases its claim is the assertion that the legal  
procedures of the agreement of December 1932 were not completed and that it was not  
registered with the Secretariat of the League of Nations.   
<P>  
However, the December Agreement was supplementary to that of January, which set the  
maritime frontier between Castellorizo and the Turkish coast and settled an issue concerning  
the sovereignty of some islets around Castellorizo, over which there was a difference of  
opinion between the two sides. The December agreement did not aim at settling any 
territorial  
difference between the two countries, as was stated both in the text of the agreement itself  
and in the letters exchanged on the 4th of January 1932, between the then Turkish Minister 
of  
Foreign Affairs and the then Italian Ambassador in Ankara, by which the two parties 
declared  
that there existed no difference as to the territorial sovereignty of each side. The December  
agreement merely sets with precision the remaining maritime frontier between the  
Dodecanese and the Turkish coast. For this reason it did not need separate registration with  
the Secretariat of the League of Nations. It is thus not surprising that the delimitation of the  
frontier set by this agreement was never in the past contested by Turkey or Italy, even after  
the Dodecanese was ceded to Greece.   
<P>  
Turkey has further asserted that Greece allegedly had doubts, at the time of the signing of 
the  
Paris Peace Treaty, concerning the validity of the 1932 agreements. This Turkish argument is  
unfounded both in law and in fact. As noted above, according to international law, the  
successor state succeeds to all rights and obligations established by international treaties  
between the original possessor state and any third party. Greece had no doubt as to the  
validity of the aforementioned agreements nor had Turkey or Italy, since they both  
immediately implemented the provisions of the Agreement and abided by them thereafter.  
There is clearly no need for any confirmation of the validity of any treaty regulating the 
status  
of the ceded territories.  
<P>  
This is further evidenced by other international agreements and maps of the immediate post  
World-War period, according to which this delimitation is officially recognized by Turkey 
as  
her frontier line with Greece. To mention just two, there is the map attached to the 1950 
ICAO  
Regional Agreement adopted by the Council of the Organization, and also the official 
Turkish  
map included in the 1953 edition of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Navigation  
through the Straits.  
<P>  
Furthermore, not only  <a href="imiamap.htm"> Greece </a> and <a href="moremaps/imia- 
tr1.jpg">Turkish maps</a>, but also official maps of <a href="other.htm">other countries</a>  
such as the  <a href="moremaps/imia2hol.jpg">  United States </a> and Italy include the Imia  
rocks within Greek national territory.   
<P>  
Finally, the fact that both  Greece  and Turkey considered the agreements of 1932 as valid, is  
shown by the fact that Greece was the country that exercised sovereign rights over the Imia  
islets all this time without Turkey ever raising any protest. The Greek Geographic Service  
repeatedly visited the Imia islets and used a trigonometric marker on the larger rock which 
it  
had installed for its purposes, Greek fishermen fished regularly in the waters surrounding  
these islets, and Greek shepherds are the owners of the goats that graze on the islets.   
Finally <a href="ecoen.htm"> environmental activities both by Greece and the European  
Union </a> were carried out on the Imia rocks since 1984.  
<P>  
Most recently, through a written statement in mid-March 1996, Turkey asserted that, in the  
case of the Aegean, it abides only by those international agreements that it itself considers  
valid, and then only by those that both it and Greece have signed. <P>  
In other words, Turkey indirectly denied the binding power of the Italian-Turkish 
agreement of  
1932 (which reaffirmed Italy's sovereignty over Imia, among other islands and islets) and of  
the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947 (in which Italy, in turn, ceded the Dodecanese islands and all  
adjacent islets to Greece). Thus, for the first time, Turkey questioned Greek sovereignty not  
just over Imia, but over all the Dodecanese islands.   
<P>  
<A NAME="G"> <STRONG> Political Aspects of the Dispute </STRONG> </A> <P>  
From the outset of the Imia crisis Greece has asked the Turkish government to affirm 
officially  
and unequivocally its adherence to three fundamental principles that guide relations among 
all  
civilized nations:  
<UL>  
<LI> that it respects international law and treaties;  
<LI> that it condemns the use of force or the threat of such use in relations between nations;  
and   
<LI> that the country raising novel territorial claims -- in this case, Turkey -- must seek their  
resolution by peaceful means, under international law, at the International Court of Justice.  
</UL>  
Among world nations today, these principles are self-evident. Any country that finds it 
difficult  
to state its unequivocal acceptance of them is a country that questions the very basis upon  
which peaceful relations among nations are built.  
<P>  
Unfortunately, in the past two months Turkey has consistently refused to make even these  
minimal and self-evident commitments. Its refusal persisted in the face of constant efforts 
by  
a number of Greece's European Union partners, as well as the United States, urging Turkey  
to do just that. On March 25, 1996, the Turkish government refused to commit itself to 
similar  
principles, which had previously been incorporated in the draft Common Position of the EU  
Foreign Ministers. As a consequence, the Council of Ministers had to postpone for the near  
future the scheduled EU-Turkey Association Council.    
<P>  
Recognizing the paucity of its legal arguments, Turkey has recently claimed that the matter  
(as well as other legal claims that Turkey unilaterally raises against Greek sovereignty) 
should  
be settled through negotiations. It goes without saying that all legitimate differences should 
be  
settled through dialogue. Greece has repeatedly invited Turkey to a sincere dialogue over 
the  
strengthening of the economic and cultural ties between the two countries. It has also 
invited  
Turkey to negotiations over the drafting of a compromise for the submittal of the two  
counties' differences over the Aegean continental shelf to the International Court of Justice.  
<P>  
Turkey has refused both of these proposals. Instead, in the case of Imia, it wishes to coerce  
Greece into bilateral negotiations over Greek sovereign rights, under the specter of the use 
of  
force. No civilized nation would willingly submit to such a process, let alone to the open  
disregard of international law, and neither will Greece. As seen above, the territorial status 
of  
the islets and rocks is absolutely clear, and Turkey herself -- understandably -- never  
challenged it in the past.    
<P>  
Unfortunately, Turkey's proposal appears to be nothing more than a thinly-veiled attempt to  
legitimize in the eyes of the international community an otherwise insupportable claim of  
sovereignty over territory that belongs to another sovereign nation. Indeed, when one  
compares Turkey's proposal for dialogue with the belligerent declarations made by former  
Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller in the aftermath of the Imia crisis -- i.e., that 1,000 
islands  
in the Aegean are Turkish (she later raised that figure to 3,000, which is roughly the total  
number of  islands in the area) -- Turkey's real intentions become even more obvious. The  
former Turkish  Prime Minister added that any attempt on the part of Greece to challenge 
her  
assessment would be a casus belli.  This second threat of war comes at the heels of the 
Turkish Parliament's aforementioned resolution concerning the extension of Greece's 
territorial  waters.  
<P> 
By challenging Greece's internationally recognized frontiers, and by using the threat of 
force to do so, Turkey violates the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of 
peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for international frontiers, which, as a signatory 
to the Charter of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, she has pledged 
to respect. In so doing, Turkey establishes itself as a real and direct threat to the peace and 
stability of the area and, in consequence, of Europe. If allowed to continue unchallenged, 
this will create an extremely dangerous precedent for all those countries that, for one reason 
or another, consider that the present borders of Europe are unjust. 
<P> 
Greece, perhaps more than any other nation, wishes to have as its neighbor a peaceful, stable, 
and prosperous Turkey. The absence of these factors can divert the imagination of some 
leaders to dangerous foreign policy adventures, as the Imia case illustrates. Greece wishes to 
develop friendly and peaceful relations with Turkey, and it will keep striving to achieve 
them in spite of any problems that may at times appear to block the way to friendship. 
<P> 
At the same time, neither Greece nor the international community can afford the 
destabilization of the Aegean region through the continuation or the encouragement of 
Turkey's illegal claims.  
<P> 
Greece, on her part, will continue to defend the principles of international law, respect for 
established borders, and the peaceful coexistence among nations both with respect to Turkey 
and with respect to all other countries in the region.

<TITLE> Ecology and the Imia Islets </TITLE> </HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<CENTER>
<H3>GREEK AND EUROPEAN UNION SCIENTIFIC AND ECOLOGICAL PROGRAMS CONCERNING THE IMIA ISLETS </H3> </CENTER>
<P>
Since 1984, Greece has engaged in ecological research activities through both national and European Community action programs and through the initiative of ecological organizations. 
<P>
<H4> THE CORINE PROGRAM </H4> <P>
The Imia islets have been declared a national and European Community protected wildlife area belonging to the area "Arki and Lipsi islands," which has been registered with the Community's environmental protection program CORINE. Within the framework of the CORINE program, the environmentally most significant areas of each member state are selected and entered into a data bank. The "Arki and Lipsi islands" area comprises of 42 islets, including Imia, and of a total area of 30 square kilometers. It should be noted that a research program concerning the area was begun in 1984 within the framework of the Community and a preliminary study was completed in 1986. The research program was continued in 1989 by the National Technical University of Athens and was completed in 1994.
<P>
<H4> E.C. DIRECTIVE 92/43 AND THE NATURA 2000 NETWORK </H4> <P>
In the framework of EC Directive 92/43 and the Community's NATURA 2000 program, roughly 296 areas have been registered by the National Center for Wildlife and Marine Wildlife areas. Among them is the area "Lipsi, Arki, Agathonisi and islets" (registration number A42100010), in which the Imia rocky islets are included. These 296 regions are automatically placed under national and future European Community environmental protection programs.
<P>
<H4> ACTIVITIES OF THE GREEK ORNITHOLOGICAL SOCIETY </H4> <P>
The Imia islets have been studied by the Greek ornithological society, which sent a team of researchers to Imia in April and June 1995 for this purpose. 
<P>
<H4> ACTIVITIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PATRAS </H4> <P>
Since 1988, the Biology Department of the University of Patras in Greece has engaged in studies of the flora of the islands of the Eastern Aegean, with funding from the national program PENED. In this context, personnel from the University of Patras have repeatedly visited the area, including the Imia islets, for the purpose of studying its flora. 
<P>
It must be noted that, since 1984, while these activities have been taking place, Turkey never raised the slightest objection nor did she create any problem with respect to the above, as she had never officially challenged Greek sovereignty over the Imia rocky islets or any other part of Greek territory. It was only during the latest crisis that, through official diplomatic channels and by specific actions, Turkey laid claim to Greek sovereign territory. <P>

2. Toutefois de la distance minima entre les territoires des deux Parties jusqu' a 
une distance de 12 milles (I mille = 1852 m.) la ligne frontire dterminera la 
souverainet des deux Pays sur les eaux de la mer. Il est par consequent bien

<h3> Declaration adopted by the 15 Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the E.U. at the last General Affairs Council on 15.7.96 </h3>
</center>
<br><br><br>
Brussels, 15 July 1996<br>
SN 3543/96<br>
<p>
<b>MEDA FINANCIAL REGULATION :<br>
DECLARATIONS TO BE ENTERED IN THE MINUTES OF THE COUNCIL</b>
<p>
<b>i. Council Declaration</b>
<p>
The European Union has followed with serious concern the situation that has emerged as a consequence of the issue raised by Turkey concerning the Imia Islets.
<p>
The resulting frictions involve, on the one hand, a Member State with which a natural solidarity exists and, on the other hand, a neighbouring country with which the European Community wishes to develop further a relationship of dialogue and cooperation in all the fields resulting from the Customs Union.
<p>
The Council recalls its attachment to the development of good neighbourly relations among all countries of the region. In this context, the Council recalls that relations between Turkey and the European Union have to be based on a clear commitment to the principle of respect for international law and agreements, the relevant international practice, and the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Member States and of Turkey.
<p>
The Council considers that disputes should be settled solely on the basis of international law. Therefore, the Council calls for restraint and avoidance of any action liable to increase tensions, and specifically the use or threat of force, and considers appropriate that dialogue should be pursued along the lines which have emerged in previous contacts between the interested parties which may contribute to the improvement of bilateral relations as well as to the establishment of a crisis prevention mechanism.
<p>
The Council further underlines that the cases of disputes created by territorial claims, such as the Imia Islet issue, should be submitted to the International Court of Justice.
<p>
The Council requests the Presidency to invite Turkey to indicate whether she commits herself to the aforementioned principles.
<p>
<b>ii. Commission Declaration</b>
<p>
The Commission declares that the adoption of the MEDA Regulation opens the way for the practical implementation once the Regulation has been published in the Official Journal.
<p>
It is however not to be expected that any formal financing decisions will be adopted before the second week of September.

<tilte>Turkey's recentnt aggression against Greece</title>

<center>
<h3>Turkey's most recent aggression against Greece: the Greek island of Gavdos</h3> 
<a href="gavdos_map.htm">Map of the island of Gavdos</a>
</center> <p>
During the planning of the NATO exercise "DYNAMIC MIX 1996" in Naples (Italy), to take place in the area of Crete (Greece), the Representative of the Turkish General Staff submitted a statement 

(dated May 30, 1996), according to which Turkey opposes the inclusion of the Greek island of Gavdos (situated southwest of Crete) in the said exercise, allegedly "due to its disputed status of property." 
<p>
This phenomenal Turkish allegation was extended further to cover all islands surrounding Crete, and was endorsed in the following days by senior officials of the Turkish Government as well as by Turkish Prime Minister Yilmaz himself.
<p>
The Turkish Representative suggested that NATO officials should refrain from becoming involved in what he termed a "dispute." 
<p>
Turkey has been challenging Greek sovereign rights in the Aegean for over 20 years (national airspace, continental shelf, territorial waters, etc.). 
 However, this year, for the first time in recent history, Turkey also proceeded to make direct claims on Greek sovereign territory. 
<p>
Starting with the Imia crisis, which led the two countries to the brink of war, Turkey,  under the prime-ministership of Mrs. Ciller, expanded her claims to a stated number of "3,000 Aegean islands." 
 In a remarkable statement, Mrs. Ciller declared as "casus belli" any "attempt of Greece" to "challenge the Turkish sovereignty over these islands."
<p>     
The claims continued with Prime Minister Yilmaz, who further extended the line of provocation, now challenging  the 1923 Peace Treaty of Lausanne itself, which is the legal cornerstone of the frontier status in the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond.
<p>
Seventy years after the signing and the application of the Lausanne Peace Treaty, Mr. Yilmaz suddenly alleges that there are "gray areas" concerning Greek sovereignty over islets and rocks in the Aegean, which he, however, persistently refuses to define. 
The Turkish government has consistently rejected the pleas of the international community that it either abandon its groundless claims or take them for peaceful resolution to the International Court of Justice.
<p>
And now Turkey, in contravention of all rules of law and logic, raises claims against the Greek island of Gavdos, the legal status of which was already set in 1913, 10 years before the Lausanne Treaty. 
<p>
Thus, Turkey renounced all sovereign rights over Crete, and Gavdos in this respect, under article 4 of the London Peace Treaty of 1913.
<p>
Furthermore, the Lausanne Peace Treaty of 1923 sets in the most specific  way the Turkish frontiers in the area of the Eastern Mediterranean, from the Black Sea down to Persia.
<p>
As far as the Aegean Sea is concerned, the Treaty of Lausanne provides specifically that Turkish sovereignty is retained only over those islands that lie within 3 miles from the Turkish coast as well as to Imbros, Tenedos and Rabbit islands.
<p>
In the same Treaty Turkey, explicitly renounces all rights and titles over all territories and islands beyond the three-mile limit. 
<p>
This legal regime in the Eastern Mediterranean has been applied and respected for over 70 years. Turkey's sudden attempts unilaterally to reject the validity of this regime constitute a real and imminent threat to the peace and stability of the entire region.

<html><head><title> The Greek minority of Turkey</title> </head><body bgcolor=#FFFFFF><p> <h3>
<center> The Greek minority of Turkey </center></h3> <p>After the end of World War I, the victorious Allied Powers signed separate peace Treaties with each of the Central Powers and their allies. In the case of Turkey, and in light of subsequent developments that had rendered the Treaty of Sevres of 1920 out of date, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed on the 24th of July 1923. <p>
<p>
The Treaty of Lausanne fixed the terms on which peace was reestablished with Turkey. It incorporated in its text the agreements signed between that country and Greece in January of that same year, which were part of the solution to the "Eastern Question." 
	<p>
One of these agreements was a Convention foreseeing the compulsory exchange of populations between the two countries. However, the Greeks of Istanbul, Imvros and Tenedos on the one hand, and the Muslims of Thrace on the other, were exempted from this exchange.
<p>
<b>A. 	The Greek-Orthodox Community of Istanbul</b> <br>

According to the provisions of the Lausanne Treaty, 73,000 Greeks were accorded Turkish citizenship while 30,000 Greek citizens permanently established until then in Istanbul, remained there as members of the Greek-Orthodox community, on the basis of a separate Protocol signed on the same date (July 1923).
	<p>
Taking into consideration that the families as well as the enterprises of the above population were strictly connected with Istanbul, this population constituted an integral part of the city.
	<p>
The Turkish side accepted their right to stay in their place of birth. This was the result not only of the Lausanne Treaty but also of the Greek-Turkish Conventions signed on July and October of 1930.
	<p>
Despite their conventional obligations, the Turks were intolerant vis a vis the minorities living in their country. Specifically, while the specter of Nazism was hovering over Europe, Turkey refused to play any part in the fight of the Western World to uphold democratic ideals, claiming "neutrality." At the same time, all Greeks between 18 and 45 years of age were mobilized and, subsequently, deported to special labor camps in the depths of Asia Minor.
	<p>
Furthermore, in November 1942, Ankara put into force the notorious "Varlik vergisi" Law imposing a wealth tax on property. The provisions of that law were enforced with exceptional zeal only against Turkish subjects belonging to non-Moslem minorities. As a result, the Greeks were forced to liquidate all their property, but since even so they were not able to meet the imposed obligations, they were uprooted from their homes and put to forced labor. (It should be noted that the Greek minority, although it constituted only 0,5% of the whole Turkish population, contributed 20% of  the country's total income emanating from this tax). 
<p>
This measure was the most serious violation of the Lausanne Treaty's dispositions for the protection of minorities.
	<p>
After a short respite in the pressure, a new period of crisis for the Greek minority began with the Cyprus affair and resulted in anti-Greek demonstrations in Istanbul and Izmir in September 1955. A mob, under the direction of the Turkish authorities, took to the streets of Constantinople. Their attacks were made exclusively against the Greeks, whose shops, workshops, houses, churches, hospitals, schools, and cemeteries were wrecked and looted.
		<p>
The refusal of any protection from the Turkish side resulted in a dramatic reduction of the Greek element of Istanbul, but the fatal blow came in 1964-1965, when Ankara denounced the Greek-Turkish Convention of 1930 on installation, which led nearly 12,600 Greek subjects living in Istanbul to a mass expulsion while, at the same time, their properties in Turkey were frozen.
		<p>
In conclusion, the mass flight of the Greeks of Istanbul is due exclusively to the unbearable conditions under which they were obliged to live. Due to these conditions, the Greek community of Constantinople that numbered 270,000 souls in 1922 has been reduced to 3,000 persons today.
<p>
<p>
<b>B. 	The Greeks of Imvros and Tenedos </b> <br>
The adventure of Greeks on the islands of Imvros and Tenedos reflects the most flagrant violations of the Lausanne Treaty's provisions.
	<p>
After a period of twelve years of Greek administration, these two islands were assigned to Turkey because of their strategic importance.
	<p>
However, the Lausanne Treaty recognized the natural right of self-determination for the Greek inhabitants of the two islands, including article 14, which provided for the status of local self-administration.
	<p>
On her part, Turkey not only refused to implement the above article but tried its best to eliminate the Greek element from the islands. With the exception of a short interval between 1951 and 1963, the teaching of the Greek language was forbidden on Imvros and Tenedos. 
<p>
A critical factor that forced the Greek population to leave the islands was the installation of an open prison for criminals from  continental Turkey. In this way, Ankara violated the provisions of Lausanne Treaty by expropriating 95% of arable land belonging to the Greeks of Imvros.
	<p>
The result of this policy was the reduction of the exclusively Greek population of Imvros from 8,000 in 1922 to 400 inhabitants today. Tenedos suffered a similar reduction as its Greek population numbered 5,320 people in 1922 and no more than 100 today.

<TITLE>Relations with the countries of Central Europe</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<CENTER><H3> Relations with the countries of Central Europe </H3> </CENTER>
<p>
Greece's  traditional commercial, historical, and cultural ties with the countries of Central Europe serve as the basis upon which extensive and substantive relations are built. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the countries of Central Europe became centers of a revival  of  Greek culture, whereas the thriving Greek communities in the major Central European cities established strong links with the local populations . Even before the 18th century, Byzantine scholars and Christian priests, while traveling around Central Europe, introduced therein important elements of Greek, Roman, and Byzantine culture and civilization.
<p>
Greece attaches special importance to the political stability and the economic development of the countries of Central Europe. Although she recognizes the inherent difficulties involved in the efforts towards the establishment of democracy and the transition to market economies, she is also convinced that these efforts will lead to  positive results, as already witnessed in many cases.
<p>
On the other hand, democracy and economic stability in Central Europe will only be sustainable if they are well-founded upon regional and global peace and security. Subsequently, Greece supports wholeheartedly the initiatives for enhancing co-operation and security in Central and Eastern Europe, either on bilateral or on multilateral bases. 
<p>
Within this context, Greece supports the efforts undertaken by European and other international fora and organizations (such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe) to reinforce democratic institutions within Central European countries, to enhance respect for international law and the implementation of OSCE principles, and to take advantage of the existing mechanisms of conflict prevention. Within this framework of co-operation, Greece supports the Central European countries' participation in the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, the "Partnership for Peace" initiative, and the special status established at the Western European Union.
<p>
During the Greek Presidency of the European Union (first half of 1994), the political dialogue of the EU with the countries of Central Europe was strengthened. Furthermore, during the same period, Poland and Hungary concluded European Association Agreements. Moreover, Greece, together with its EU partners, is providing considerable economic and technical assistance to Central Europe under various development programmes (e.g. PHARE) in addition to the high-level political co-operation already established. 
<p>
It should be noted that Greece maintains excellent bilateral relations with the countries of Central Europe, within a framework of  agreements of  co-operation on commercial, trade, scientific, and cultural issues, coupled with a considerable number of annual official visits. Additionally, the volume of commercial and trade activity has increased the last two years, indicating a healthy economic interaction that includes direct investments by Greek firms in some of these countries.  Moreover, in order to facilitate the direct communication among citizens themselves, a number of measures have been undertaken, including the abolition of visa requirements and the facilitation of tour operators.
<p>
Greece believes that it is necessary for the benefit of all European countries to consolidate democracy and to ensure for their people prosperity, along with better living standards. Thus, within the process of economic and political integration in Europe, the role of all Central and Eastern European countries will be decisive, in order to achieve peace, security, and stability in the Continent, without creating new dividing lines.

<P>

Greece attaches special importance to the post-cold war developments in the Russian Federation, and especially to the introduction of democratic institutions as well as economic liberalization and stabilization. Greece supports the transition of the Russian centrally-planned economy to a market economy.
<p>
Within this context, Greece encourages Russian integration in international and European organizations, thus promoting political stability in Europe as well as the establishment of a common European security system, based on peaceful relations and economic prosperity. Greece, therefore, has been a keen supporter of the Russian candidature for membership of the Council of Europe, recently achieved. Moreover, she encourages  closer cooperation between NATO and Russia.
<p>
On the European level, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation was signed on the island of Corfu in June 1994, during the Greek Presidency. Greece has already ratified this Agreement. 
<p>
Bilateral Greek - Russian relations are based on the traditional and historical ties of friendship between the peoples of the two countries. The framework of bilateral relations consists of a series of important agreements spreading over various fields of cooperation (economic, industrial, trade, scientific, military, cultural exchanges, etc.). Special mention should be made of the "Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation" (June 1993), the "Protocol on the Legal Framework" between the two countries (December 1995), as well as the "Agreement on the Establishment of Russian General Consulates in Thessaloniki and Greek General Consulates in Saint Petersburg and Novorossisk." 
<p>
In addition to the above agreements, numerous official visits, at many levels, take place on a bilateral basis.
<p>
The large Greek community (mainly in Southern Russia)  with a very long historical presence in the region, including the Caucasus, constitutes both an important link and a bridge of friendship between the two countries. During the post-communist era, a large proportion of the Greek community , under the pressure of the economic crisis, migrated to Greece. Today, Greece provides substantial assistance to those who chose to remain, helping to increase their ties with the Greek language and culture through a series of special programmes.
<p>
In recent years, important projects in the form of Greek-Russian joint ventures are being realized in Greece, especially in the field of energy (natural gas pipeline, electricity production, etc.) and more are planned (alumina plant, transbalkan pipeline from the Black Sea to the Aegean, including Bulgarian participation, etc.).
<p>
At the same time, Greece is promoting private sector investments for the economic development of the Krasnodar region in Southern Russia.

<CENTER><H3> Relations with Ukraine</H3> </CENTER>
<P>
Greek-Ukrainian relations have developed steadily in all fields ever since Ukraine declared its independence after the disintegration of the former Soviet Union.
	<p>
A Greek Embassy was established in Kiev in 1993 and a Consulate is about to open in Odessa, where a branch of the Foundation for Hellenic Culture has already been functioning for the last two years.
	<p>
A number of agreements promoting bilateral cooperation in various fields have already been concluded.  Prime among them is the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation, which was finalized in November 1995 in Athens.
	<p>
Greece supports the process of economic and other reforms leading to democratization, and encourages Ukraine's association with world and European structures and organizations. It should be noted that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine was signed during the Greek Presidency (14 June 1994).
	<p>
A large Greek community lives in Ukraine (numbering approximately 200,000), mainly in the regions of Mariupol, Kharkov, Odessa, and the Crimea. Greece supports the efforts of Ukrainians of Greek descent to maintain their ties with the Greek language and culture. Special programmes exist  for this purpose.

<html><head><title> Greece, the Middle East and the Mediterranean area </title> </head><body bgcolor=#FFFFFF><p> <h3>
<center> Greece, the Middle East and the Mediterranean area </center></h3> <p>Greece traditionally has had close cultural, economic, and political ties with the Middle East and the Mediterranean Countries.<p>
<p>
These ties will be further developed when the Middle East crisis is finally resolved,  an goal for which the Greek government has always been working.<p>
<p>
With regards to the Middle East peace process,<p>
<ul>
<li>We are convinced that, for the peoples of the region, there is no choice other than the continuation of the Peace Process on the basis of the principle "land for peace".<p>

<li>We look forward to a timely implementation of the Agreements.<p>

<li>We believe that the outcome of the Israeli elections should not influence the negotiations for the final status of the Palestinian Territories.<p>

<li>We are in favor of a more active involvement of the E.U. in the Peace Process. This involvement should not be limited to the economic sector, but also include the political dimension. <p>
</ul>
