<H3>What Causes AD/HD?</H3>

<P>AD/HD is a neurobiologically-based developmental disability estimated to affect between 3-5% of the school age population (Professional Group for Attention and Related Disorders, 1991). No one knows exactly what causes AD/HD. Scientific evidence suggests that the disorder is genetically transmitted in many cases and results from a chemical imbalance or deficiency in certain neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that help the brain regulate behavior. In addition, a landmark study conducted by the National institute of Mental Health showed that the rate at which the brain uses glucose, its main energy source, is lower in subjects with AD/ HD than in subjects without AD/ HD (Zametkin et al., 1990).</P>

<P>Even though the exact cause of AD/HD remains unknown, we do know that AD/HD is a neurologically-based medical problem. Parents and teachers do not cause AD/ HD. Still, there are many things that both can do to help a child manage his or her AD/HD-related difficulties. Before we look at what needs to be done, however, let us look at what AD/HD is and how it is diagnosed.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<a name="Symptons"></a>
<HR>
<H3>What Are the Signs of AD/HD?</H3>

<P>Professionals who diagnose AD/ HD use the diagnostic criteria set forth by the American Psychiatric Association (1994) in the Diagnostic and Statistical/ Manual of Mental/ Disorders; the fourth edition of this manual, known as the DSM-IV, was released in May 1994. The criteria in the DSM-IV (discussed below) and the other essential diagnostic features listed in the box on the next page are the signs of AD/HD.</P>

<P>As can be seen, <B>the primary features associated with the disability are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.</B> The discussion below describes each of these features and lists their symptoms, as given in the DSM-IV.</P>

<I><B>Inattention</B></I>

<P>A child with AD/HD is usually described as having a short attention span and as being distractible. In actuality, distractibility and inattentiveness are not synonymous. Distractibility refers to the short attention span and the ease with which some children can be pulled off-task. Attention, on the other hand, is a process that has different parts. We focus ( pick something on which to pay attention), we select (pick something that needs attention at that moment) and we sustain (pay attention for as long as is needed). We also resist (avoid things that remove our attention from where it needs to be), and we shift (move our attention to something else when needed).</P>

<P>When we refer to someone as distractible, we are saying that a part of that person's attention process is disrupted. Children with AD/HD can have difficulty with one or all parts of the attention process. Some children may have difficulty concentrating on tasks (particularly on tasks that are routine or boring). Others may have trouble knowing where to start a task. Still others may get lost in the directions along the way. A careful observer can watch and see where the attention process breaks down for a particular child.</P>

<P>Symptoms of inattention, as listed in the DSM-IV, are:</P>

<OL TYPE=a START="1">
	<LI> often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, work, or other activities;<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities;<BR><BR>

	<LI>  often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly;<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand instructions);<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities;<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI> often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (such as schoolwork or homework);<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., toys, school assignments, pencils, books, or tools);<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli;<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI> is often forgetful in daily activities. (American Psychiatric Association, 1994, pp. 83-84)<BR><BR>
</OL>

<B><I>Hyperactivity</I></B>

<P>Excessive activity is the most visible sign of AD/I ID. The hyperactive toddler/preschooler is generally described as "always on the go" or "motor driven." With age, activity levels may diminish. By adolescence and adulthood, the overactivity may appear as restless, fidgety behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).</P>

<P>Symptoms of hyperactivity, as listed in the DSM-IV, are:</P>

<OL TYPE=a START="1">
	<LI>  often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat;<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  often leaves seat in classroom or in other situations in which remaining seated is expected;<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  often runs about or climbs excessively in situations in which it is inappropriate (in adolescents or adults, may be limited to subjective feelings of restlessness);<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  often has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly;<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI> is often "on the go" or often acts as if "driven by a motor;"<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  often talks excessively. (APA, 1994, p. 84)<BR><BR>
 
</OL>

<I><B>Impulsivity</B></I>

<P>When people think of impulsivity, they most often think about cognitive impulsivity, which is acting without thinking. The impulsivity of children with AD/HD is slightly different. These children act before thinking, because they have difficulty waiting or delaying gratification. 'The impulsivity leads these children to speak out of turn, interrupt others, and engage in what looks like risk-taking behavior. The child may run across the street without looking or climb to the top of very tall trees. Although such behavior is risky, the child is not really a risk-taker but, rather, a child who has great difficulty controlling impulse. Often, the child is surprised to discover that he or she has gotten into a dangerous situation and has no idea of how to get out of it.</P>

Symptoms of impulsivity, as listed in the DSM-IV (p. 84), are:

<OL TYPE=a START="7">
	<LI> often blurts out answers before questions have been completed;<BR><BR>

	<LI> often has difficulty awaiting turn;<BR><BR>

	<LI> often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games).<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>It is important to note that, in the DSM-IV, hyperactivity and impulsivity are no longer considered as separate features. According to Barkley (1990), hyperactivity-impulsivity is a pattern stemming from an overall difficulty in inhibiting behavior.</P>

<P>In addition to problems with inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity, the disorder is often seen with associated features. Depending on the child's age and developmental stage, parents and teachers may see low frustration tolerance, temper outbursts, bossiness, difficulty in following rules, disorganization, social rejection, poor self-esteem, academic underachievement, and inadequate self-application (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).</P>

<a name="Evaluation"></a>
<HR>

<H3>How Do I Know For Sure If My Child Has AD/HD?</H3>

<P>Unfortunately, no simple test such as a blood test or urinanalysis exists to determine if a child has this disorder. Diagnosing AD/HD is complicated and much like putting together a puzzle. An accurate diagnosis requires an assessment conducted by a well-trained professional (usually a developmental pediatrician, child psychologist, child psychiatrist, or pediatric neurologist) who knows a lot about AD/HD and all other disorders that can have symptoms similar to those found in AD/HD. Until the practitioner has collected and evaluated all the necessary information, he or she must follow the same rule of thumb as the parent or teacher who sees the behavior and suspects that the child has the disorder: Assume the child might have AD/HD.</P>

<P>The AD/HD diagnosis is made on the basis of observable behavioral symptoms in multiple settings. This means that the person doing the evaluation must use multiple sources to collect the information needed. A proper AD/HD diagnostic evaluation includes the following elements:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> A thorough medical and family history<BR><BR>

	<LI> A physical examination<BR><BR>

	<LI> Interviews with the parents, the child, and the child's teacher(s)<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Behavior rating scales completed by parents and teacher(s)<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Observation of the child<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> A variety of psychological tests to measure I.Q. and social and emotional adjustment, as well as to indicate the presence of specific learning disabilities.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>It is important to realize that, almost characteristically, children with AD/HD often behave well in new situations, particularly in those that are one-on-one. Therefore, a well-trained diagnostician knows not to make a determination based solely on how the child behaves during their time together.</P>

<P>Sophisticated medical tests such as EEGs (to measure the brain's electrical activity) or MRls (an X-ray of the brain's anatomy) are NOT part of the routine assessment. Such tests are usually given only when the diagnostician suspects another problem, and those cases are infrequent. Similarly, positron emission tomography (PET Scan) has recently been used for research purposes but is not part of the diagnostic evaluation.</P>

<P>After completing an evaluation, the diagnostician makes one of three determinations:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> the child has AD/HD;<BR><BR>

	<LI> the child does not have AD/ HD but his or her difficulties are the result of another disorder or other factors; or<BR><BR>

	<LI> the child has AD/HD and another disorder (called a co-existing condition).<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>To make the first determination, that the child has AD/HD, the professional considers his or her findings in relation to the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition), the DSM-IV, of the American Psychiatric Association (1994). A very important criterion for diagnosis is that the child's symptoms be present prior to age 7. They must also be inappropriate for the child's age and cause clinically significant impairment in social and academic functioning.</P>

<P>To make the second determination, that the child's difficulties are the result of another disorder or other factors, the professional considers the exclusionary criteria found in the DSM-IV and his or her knowledge of disorders with similar symptomatology. According to the DSM-IV, ''Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Mood Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Dissociative Disorder, Personality Disorder, Personality Change Due to a General Medical Condition, or a Substance-Related Disorder). in all these disorders, the symptoms of inattention typically have an onset after age 7 years, and the childhood history of school adjustment generally is not characterized by disruptive behavior or teacher complaints concerning inattentive, hyperactive, or impulsive behavior" (American Psychiatric Association, 1994, p. 83).</P>

<P>Furthermore, psychosocial stressors, such as parental divorce, child abuse, death of a loved one, environmental disruption (such as change in residence or school), or disasters can result in temporary symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and overactivity. Under these circumstances, symptoms generally arise suddenly and, therefore, would have no long-term history. Of course, a child can have AD/HD and also experience psychosocial stress, so such events do not automatically rule out the existence of AD/HD.</P>

<P>To make the third determination, that the child has AD/HD and a co-existing condition, the assessor must first be aware that AD/ HD can and often does co-exist with other difficulties, particularly learning disabilities, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. All factors must be considered to ensure the child's difficulties are evaluated and managed comprehensively.</P>

<P>Clearly, diagnosis is not as simple as reading a symptom list and saying, "This child has AD/HD!" This Briefing Paper explores the issue of diagnosis in some depth, because no one wants children to be misdiagnosed. As parents, the more we know, the more we can help our children to succeed. We probably do not need to know how to use the DSM-IV. We probably <I>do</I> need to know that the person evaluating our child is using the specified criteria for AD/HD and all the components of a comprehensive assessment.</P>

<H3>How Do I Have My Child Evaluated for AD/HD?</H3>

<P>When a child is experiencing difficulties which suggest that he or she may have AD/HD, parents can take one of two basic paths to evaluation. They can seek the services of an outside professional or clinic, or they can request that their local school district conduct an evaluation.</P>

<P>In pursuing a private evaluation or in selecting a professional to perform an assessment for AD/HD, parents should consider the clinician's training and experience with the disorder, as well as his or her availability to coordinate the various treatment approaches. Most AD/HD parent support groups have knowledge of clinicians trained to evaluate and treat children with AD/ HD. Parents may also consult their child's pediatrician, community mental health center, university mental health clinics, or hospital child evaluation units.</P>

<P>It is important for parents to realize, however, that <B>the schools have an affirmative obligation to evaluate a child (aged 3-21) if school personnel suspect that he or she might have AD/HD or any other disability that is adversely affecting educational performance</B>. This evaluation is provided free of charge to families and must, by law, involve more than one standardized test or procedure.</P>

<P>Thus, if you suspect that your child has an attentional or hyperactivity problem, or know for certain that your child has AD/HD, and his or her educational performance appears to be adversely affected, you should first request that the school system evaluate your child. When making this request, it is a good idea to be as specific as possible about the kinds of educational difficulties your child is experiencing.</P>

<P>If your child is an infant or toddler, you may want to investigate what early intervention services are available in your state through the Part H program of the individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). You can find out about the availability of these services in your state by contacting the State Department of Education or local education agency (both of which are listed on NICHCY's State Resource Sheet), by asking your pediatrician, or by contacting the nursery or child care department in your local hospital. While your state may not specifically list AD/HD as a disability to be addressed through the Part H program, most states have a category such as "atypical children" or "other" under which an AD/HD assessment might be made.</P>

<P>Preschoolers (children aged 3-5) may be eligible for services under Part B of the IDEA. If your child is a preschooler, you may wish to contact the State Department of Education or local school district, ask your pediatrician, or talk with local day care providers about how to access special education services in order to have your child assessed.</P>

<P>Also, under the 1993 Head Start regulations, AD/HI) is considered a chronic or acute health impairment entitling the child to special education services when the child's inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are developmentally inappropriate, chronic, and displayed in multiple settings, and when the AD/HD severely affects performance in normal developmental tasks (for example, in planning and completing activities or following simple directions).</P>

<P>If your child is school-aged, and you suspect that AD/HD may be adversely affecting his or her educational performance, you can ask your local school district to conduct an evaluation. With the exception of the physical examination, the assessment can be conducted by the child study team, provided a member of the team is knowledgeable about assessing Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder. If not, the district may need to utilize an outside professional consultant trained in the assessment of AD/ I ID. This person must know what to look for during child observation, be competent to conduct structured interviews with the parent, teacher(s), and child, and know how to administer and interpret behavior rating scales.</P>

<P>Identifying where to go and whom to contact in order to request an evaluation is just the first step in the process. Unfortunately, many parents experience difficulty in the next step: getting the school system to agree to evaluate their child. If the school district does not believe that the child's educational performance is being adversely affected, it may refuse to evaluate the child. In this case, parents may wish to pursue a private evaluation. It is also important to persist with the school, enlisting the assistance of an advocate, if necessary. Parents can generally find  this type of assistance by contacting the Parent Training and information (PTI) center for their state, the Protection and Advocacy (P&amp;A) agency, or the local parent group. A school district's refusal to evaluate a child suspected of having AD/HD involves issues that must be addressed on an individual basis; these organizations will typically be able to provide information on parent's legal rights, offer direct assistance, in many cases, and give specific suggestions on how to proceed.</P>

<P>For children who are evaluated by the school system, eligibility for special education and related services will be based upon evaluation results and the specific policies of the state. Many parents have found this to be a problematic area as well, and so eligibility for special education services is discussed in greater detail towards the end of this Briefing Paper. For the moment, however, let us look at what we know about managing AD/HD and the specific difficulties associated with the disorder.</P>

<P><I><B>"I am one of the lucky mothers. I now understand why my son behaves the way he does. I know now that the disturbing behaviors which appeared at various stages of his development were neither of his own doings or my fault.</B></I></P>

<P><B><I>If you are the parent of a child with AD/HD, I want you to know that children with AD/HD aren't really pain in the neck kids with lousy parents. Understand that they are children who have AD/HD and know when and where to go for help and support."</I></B></P>

<P>From Mary Fowler's (1993), <I>Maybe you know my kid: A parent's guide to identifying, understanding, and helping your child with ADHD</I> (2nd cd ). Used with permission.</P>
<HR>
<H3>How is AD/HD Treated?</H3>

<P>No cure or "quick fix" exists to treat AD/HD. The symptoms, however, can be managed through a combination of efforts. Management approaches need to be designed to assist the child behaviorally, educationally, psychologically, and, in many instances, pharmacologically.</P>

<P>Called multi-modal management, this approach consists of four basic parts: education about and understanding of AD/HD, behavior management, appropriate educational interventions, and, frequently, medication. In some instances, individual or family counseling is also advised.</P>

<B><I>Understanding AD/HD</I></B>

<P>AD/HD has been called an environmentally dependent disability. The significant people in the life of those who have AD/HD need to understand that difficulties will rise and fall in relation to the environment's demands and expectations. Problems often arise in environments where children are expected to be seen and not heard, to pay careful attention, and to use great self-control. Often, when children with AD/HD fall short of meeting these expectations, we try to change the children, rather than changing aspects of the environment, including our actions and reactions.</P>

<P>Parents and teachers need to be aware of the symptoms of AD/HD and how those symptoms impact the child's ability to function at home, in school, and in social situations. When the adults in the child's life understand the nature of the disorder, they will be able to structure situations to enable the child to behave appropriately and achieve success. Remember, the child who has difficulty with attention, impulse control, and in regulating physical activity needs help and encouragement to manage these problems.</P>

<P>From a thorough understanding of AD/HD comes a change in the way the child's behavior is viewed. This change sets the stage for the effective use of the other components of the AD/HD management system.</P>

<I><B>Behavior Management</B></I>

<P>The main goal of all behavior management strategies is to increase the child's appropriate behavior and decrease inappropriate behavior. The best way to influence any behavior is to pay attention to it. The best way to increase a desirable behavior is to <I>catch the child being good</I>.</P>

<P>Behavior is defined as a specific act or actions. When thinking about managing behavior, many people focus on the act or actions. In actuality, behavior management is much broader. It takes into account that, before a specific act or action occurs, there is something that sets the stage for the act to happen (called an antecedent), and something that follows which either encourages or discourages a repetition of the act (called a consequence). Behavior management involves changing the antecedents and consequences so that the child's behavior changes.</P>

<P>By establishing structure and routines, preparing the child for changes in the routine, building opportunities for the child to be successful, setting consequences ahead of time, and anticipating where difficulties may arise, parents and teachers can change the antecedents and cultivate an environment that encourages the child to behave appropriately. When adults in the child's life do what they say they are going to do, and do so on a consistent basis so that the child knows their word has meaning, then they are providing the consequences to encourage the child to continue behaving appropriately, plus discouraging any undesired behavior.</P>

<P>Behavior management is a skill. It requires practice, and it requires patience. Changing behavior takes time.</P>

<P>Behaviorally trained professionals often encourage the use of behavior modification charts. Charts are designed to provide the child with a clear picture of what behaviors are expected. The child then has the choice of whether to meet those expectations. Parents or teachers provide feedback to the child about his or her choices by delivering consequences. Charts provide high motivation and enable the child to develop an internal sense of self-control, specifically, that he or she can behave appropriately.</P>

<P>There are two basic types of chart programs. (1) <I>Token Economy</I>: Here, the child earns tokens (chips, stickers, stars) for appropriate behavior. Tokens can be exchanged for various rewards. (2) <I>Response Cost</I>: In this chart program, the child is given tokens for free. Tokens are withdrawn for inappropriate behavior (e.g., out of seat, off-task, etc.).</P>

<P>The most effective programs use both types of chart systems and work on a give-and-take basis. In this combination system, the child is given a token for behaving appropriately and loses a token when misbehaving.</P>

<P>When creating and implementing a behavior modification chart, you may wish to follow these suggestions: </P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI>Make a list of problematic behaviors or ones that need improving.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Select the behaviors to be modified. Parents (or teachers), with input from the child, review the list of problematic behaviors and select three, four, or five to work on at a given time. The behaviors charted should be ones that occur daily, such as going to bed on time, doing homework, or getting ready for school on time. <BR><BR>

	<LI> Design a reward system (Token Economy, Response Cost, or a combination). Parents (or teachers) need to pay attention to the child's behavior throughout the course of the day and provide frequent rewards when the child behaves appropriately. At the end of the day, tokens can be exchanged for rewards, such as extended bed time, playing a game with Mom or Dad, or a favorite snack. Remember, a reward is only effective when it has value to the child. Rewards might have to be changed frequently. <BR><BR>

</UL>

<P> <I>About Punishment</I>: Children with AD/HD respond best to motivation and positive reinforcement. It is best to avoid punishment. When punishment is necessary, use it sparingly and with sensitivity. It is important for parents and teachers to respond to this child's inappropriate behavior without anger and in a matter-of-fact way. These children need to be taught to replace inappropriate behavior with appropriate behavior. </P>

<P><I>About Time-out</I>: When the child is misbehaving or out of control, time-out is an effective way to manage the problem. Time-out means the child is sent to a predetermined location for a short period of time. A place out of the mainstream of activity is best; for example, one particular chair may be specified as the "time-out chair." The time-out location should not be a traumatic place, such as a closet or dark basement. The purpose of time-out is to provide the child with a cooling-off period wherein he or she can regain control.</P>

<P>An important aspect to time-out is that the child no longer has the privilege of choosing where he or she would like to be or how time is spent. In general, the child stays in time-out and must be quiet for five minutes. Preschool-aged children are usually given two or three minutes in time-out. For toddlers, 30 seconds to a minute is appropriate.</P>

<I><B>Medication</B></I>

<P><B>Medication has proven effective for many children with AD/HD. Most experts agree, however, that medication should never be the only treatment used.</B> The parents' decision to place a child on medication is a personal one and should be made after a thorough evaluation of the child has taken place and after careful consideration by both the parents and the physician.</P>

<P>Stimulants are the medication most widely prescribed for AD/HD. These drugs, for example, Ritalin (the most widely used), Dexedrine, Cylert, are believed to stimulate the action of the brain's neurotransmitters, which enables the brain to better regulate attention, impulse, and motor behavior. In general, the short-acting stimulant medications (e.g., Ritalin, Dexedrine) have few and mild side effects. For children who cannot take stimulant drugs, anti-depressant medications or Clonidine are used.</P>

<P>The prescribing physician should explain the benefits and drawbacks of medication to the parents and, when appropriate, to the child. Doses are generally administered gradually, so that the child receives the lowest dose needed to achieve the best therapeutic benefit. Parents should dispense the medication as prescribed and monitor closely how their child responds to the medication, including side effects. Such monitoring generally includes feedback from the child's teacher(s), which is usually based on the use of behavior rating scales. Parents should communicate with the physician as often as is necessary to determine when medication has reached the proper level for the child, and to discuss any problems or questions.</P>

<P><I><B>A note of caution: </B></I>Many parents and teachers have heard that mega-vitamins, chiropractic scalp massage, visual/ocular motor training, biofeedback, allergy treatments, and diets are useful treatments for AD/HD. However, these treatments have not been recommended by AD/HD experts for the simple reason that they have not stood up under careful scientific scrutiny. As their child's primary caregivers and advocates, parents need to become informed consumers and exercise caution when considering such treatments.</P>

<B><I>Educational Intervention</I></B>

<P>Many children with AD/HD experience the greatest difficulty in school, where demands for attention and impulse and motor control are virtual requirements for success. Although AD/HD does not interfere with the ability to learn, it does wreak havoc on performance. Thus, in the school arena, AD/HD is an <I>educational performance problem</I>. When little or nothing is done to help these children improve their performance, over time they will evidence academic achievement problems. This underachievement is not the result of an inability to learn. It is caused by the cumulative effects of missing important blocks of information and skill development that build from lesson to lesson and from one school year to the next.</P>

<P>Generally, AD/HD will affect the student in one or more of the following performance areas:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> starting tasks, <BR><BR>

	<LI> staying on task,<BR><BR>

	<LI> completing tasks,<BR><BR>

	<LI> making transitions,<BR><BR>

	<LI> interacting with others,<BR><BR>

	<LI> following through on directions, <BR><BR>

	<LI> producing work at consistently normal levels, and <BR><BR>

	<LI> organizing multi-step tasks.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>Those teaching or designing programs for these students need to pinpoint where each student's difficulties occur, Otherwise, valuable intervention resources may be spent in areas where they are not critical. For example, one child with AD/HD may have difficulty starting a task because the directions are not clear, while another student may fully understand the directions but have difficulty making transitions and, as a result, get stuck in the space where one task ends and another begins. With the first child, intervention needs to focus upon making directions clear and in helping the child to understand those directions. The second child would need help in making transitions from one activity to another.</P>

<P>The sooner educational interventions begin, the better. They should be started when educational performance problems become evident and not delayed because the child is still holding his or her own on achievement tests.</P>

<H3>What About Special Education?</H3>

<P>The type of special education services a child receives will depend upon the nature and severity of his or her difficulties. Nor all of these children will need special education services. And not all of these children can receive an appropriate education without special education services. Decisions about children's need for special education and their subsequent placement must be made on a case-by-case basis.</P>

<P>A series of steps is typically necessary in order for the child to receive special education services. First, the child must be experiencing educational performance problems. Second, when such problems become evident, the parent or teacher can refer the child to the local school district's child evaluation team and request an evaluation. 'Third, an evaluation is performed to determine if the child does indeed have a disability according to eligibility criteria set forth in state and federal law and if that disability is adversely affecting the child's educational performance. If so, the child may then be found eligible for special education services.</P>

<P>When a child is found eligible for special education, his or her parents collaborate with school personnel to develop an individualized Education Program (IEP) designed to address the child's specific problems and unique learning needs. Here, strengths are considered as well. Strategies to improve social and behavioral problems are also addressed in the IF.P. After specifying the nature of the child's special needs, the IEP team, including parents, determines what types of services are appropriate for addressing those needs and whether these services will be delivered in the regular education classroom or elsewhere (such as the resource room or through individualized attention).</P>

<P>Researchers estimate that half of the children with AD/HD will be able to perform to their ability levels without special education services, <I>provided the disorder is recognized, understood, and curriculum adjustments to the regular program of instruction are made</I>.</P>

<P>The majority of children with AD/HD who require special education services (approximately 35%-40%) will receive them through combined placements which might include the regular education classroom, with or without in-class support, and the resource room. Support personnel are likely to be used as case managers and consultants to regular education teachers.</P>

<P>Some children (approximately 10%) may need to be served in a self-contained classroom with minimal mainstreaming. Such children are likely to have severe AD/HD and will probably have coexisting conditions as well.</P>
<HR>

<H3>Guidelines for Educational Intervention</H3>

<P>Here are several general guidelines for improving the social and academic performance of children with AD/HD in both regular and special education settings.</P>
<UL Type=Disk>
<LI> <I>Place the student with teachers who are positive, upbeat, highly organized problem-solvers</I>. Teachers who use praise and rewards liberally and who are willing to "go the extra mile" to help students succeed can be enormously beneficial to the student with AD/HD.<BR><BR>

<LI> <I>Provide the student with a structured and predictable environment.</I> As part of this environment: <BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI> display rules 
	
	<LI> post daily schedules and assignments 
 
	<LI> call attention to schedule changes 
	 
	<LI> set specific times for specific tasks 
	 
	<LI> design a quiet work space for use upon request 
	 
	<LI> seat the child with positive peer models 
	 
	<LI> plan academic subjects for morning hours 
 
	<LI> provide regularly scheduled and frequent breaks 
 
	<LI> use attention-getting devices (e.g., secret signals, color codes)<BR><BR>
</UL>

<LI> <I>Modify the curriculum</I>. In many cases, AD/HD students can benefit from the "less is more" maxim. That is to say, if the student can demonstrate proficiency in 10 problems, 20 do not need to be assigned. Curriculum modification can also include: <BR><BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI>mixing high and low interest activities; 
	<LI>providing computerized learning materials; 
	<LI>simplifying and increasing visual presentations; 
	<LI>teaching organization and study skills; 
	<LI>using learning strategies such as mnemonic devices and links; 
	<LI>and using visual references for auditory instruction.<BR><BR>
</UL>
</UL>
<I><B>Additional Principles of Remediation</B></I>
<P>These guidelines were designed by Sydney Zentall, Ph.D. (1991).</P>
<UL Type=Disk>
<LI> <I>For Excessive Activity</I>: <BR><BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI> Channel activity into acceptable avenues. For example, rather than attempting to reduce a student's activity, teachers can encourage directed movement in classrooms when it is not disruptive, or allow standing during seatwork, especially at the end of a task. <BR><BR>
	<LI>Use activity as a reward. For example, to reward a child's appropriate behavior or improvement, a teacher might allow him or her to run an errand, clean the board, organize the teacher's desk, or arrange the chairs in the room. <BR><BR>
	<LI> Use active responses in instruction. Teaching activities that encourage active responses such as talking, moving, organizing, or working at the board are helpful to many students with AD/HD, as are activities such as writing in a diary or painting.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<LI> <I>For Inability to Wait</I>: <BR><BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI> Give the child substitute verbal or motor responses to make white waiting. This might include teaching the child how to continue on easier parts of a task (or a substitute task) while waiting for the teacher's help. <BR><BR>
	<LI> When possible, allow daydreaming or planning while the child waits. For example, the child might be allowed to doodle or play with clay while waiting, or might be guided to underline or write directions or relevant information. <BR><BR>
	<LI> When inability to wait becomes impatience or bossiness, encourage leadership. Do not assume that impulsive statements or behavior are aggressive in intent. Suggest alternative ways or behaviors (e.g., line reader, paper passer). It may be important to cue a student when an upcoming task will be difficult and extra control will be needed.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<LI> <I>For Failure to Sustain Attention to Routine Tasks and Activities:</I><BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI> Decrease the length of the task. There are many ways to do this, including breaking one task into smaller parts to be completed at different times or giving fewer spelling words or math problems.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Make tasks interesting. Teachers can heighten interest in tasks by allowing students to work with partners or in small groups, by using an overhead projector, and by alternating high and low interest activities. Make a game out of checking work, and use games to overlearn rote material.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<LI> <I>For Noncompliance and Failure to Complete Tasks:</I> <BR><BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI> Generally increase the choice and specific interest of tasks for the child. Teachers may allow the student with AD/HD a limited choice of tasks, topics, and activities,. Teachers may also find it useful to determine which activities the student prefers and to use these as incentives. <BR><BR>
	<LI> Make sure tasks fit within the student's learning abilities and preferred response style. Students are more likely to complete tasks when they are allowed to respond in various ways (e.g., typewriter, computer, on tape) and when the difficulty of assignments varies (i.e., not all tasks are equally difficult) <I>It is important to make sure that disorganization is not the reason the student is failing to complete tasks.</I><BR><BR>
</UL>

<LI><I> For Difficulty at the Beginning of Tasks:</I> <BR><BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI>Increase the structure of tasks and highlight important parts. 'This includes encouraging note-taking; giving directions in writing as well as orally; stating the standards of acceptable work as specifically as possible; and pointing OUt how tasks are structured (e.g., topic sentences, headers, table of contents).<BR><BR>
</UL>

<LI> <I>For Completing Assignments or Time:</I> <BR><BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI> Increase the student's use of lists and assignment organizers (notebooks, folders), write assignments on the board, and make sure that the student has copied them. <BR><BR>
	<LI> Establish routines to place and retrieve commonly used objects such as books, assignments, and clothes. Pocket folders are helpful here; new work can be placed on one side and completed work on the other. Parents can be encouraged to establish places for certain things (books, homework) at home. Students can be encouraged to organize their desk or locker with labels/places for certain items. <BR><BR>
	<LI> Teach the student that, upon leaving one place for another, he or she will self-question, "Do I have everything I need?" <BR><BR>

<H3>What Do I Do If My Child <BR>
Is Found Ineligible for Services?</H3>

<P>The eligibility of AD/HD children for special education services is an area of great concern to schools, parents, and advocates alike. Every year, NICHCY receives hundreds of telephone calls from parents whose children have been found ineligible for services, despite the fact that they have AD/ HD. Accordingly, this section looks at what the laws have to say about the legal rights of children with AD/ HD to special education.</P>

<P>The primary law under which schools evaluate children for special education, and then provide services to those they find eligible, is called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA. This law entitles children with disabilities to a free appropriate public education by mandating special education and related services for students who meet eligibility requirements. In order for a student to be eligible, he or she must have a disability according to the criteria established in state or federal law, or be suspected of having such a disability, and that disability must adversely affect his or her educational performance. Thus, <B>a medical diagnosis of AD/ HD alone is not sufficient to render a child eligible for services. Educational performance must be adversely affected.</B></P>

<P>Presently, the IDEA lists 13 categories of disability under which a child might be found eligible for special education services. Your child must meet the criteria for one of these categories.</P>

<P>In accordance with federal law, each state has to have a state law that entitles students with disabilities to a free appropriate public education. All state special education laws must meet the standards of federal law. Local school districts, then, must follow the state law and its accompanying rules and regulations. Yet many local school districts may not understand their obligation to provide special education to children with AD/HD in cases where the disability adversely affects the student's educational performance.</P>

<P>As a result of the considerable confusion in the field, the l J.S. Department of Education has issued two memoranda intended to clarify state and local responsibility under federal law for addressing the needs of children with AD/HD in the schools. The first memorandum, issued in 1991, states that "children with ADD should be classified as eligible for services under the "other health impaired" category in instances where the ADD is a chronic or acute health problem that results in limited alertness, which adversely affects educational performance" (U.S. Department of Education, 1991, p. 3). Children with AD/HD are also eligible for services under any other category, <I>if</I> they meet the criteria established for those disabilities; for example, "specific learning disabilities."</P>

<P>According to the memorandum, students with AD/HD might also be eligible for services under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 504 is a civil rights statute prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of federal funds.  Under Section 504, a person with a disability means any person with an impairment that "substantially limits one or more major life activities." Because "learning" is included in Section 504's definition of "major life activities," many students with AD/ HD qualify as a person with a disability. Schools are then required under Section 504 to provide them with a "free appropriate public education," which can include regular or special education and related services, depending upon each student's specific needs.</P>

<P>Therefore, if a school district finds a child ineligible for services under the IDEA, there are a number of actions parents can take to have this decision reconsidered. Parents may:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> Ask the school system for information about parent rights and the appropriate procedures for appealing the decision, including mediation and due process. Due process is a right under the IDEA. State and local laws will specify the procedures to be followed, as required by the IDEA.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Ask to have their child evaluated under the criteria of Section 504. Many children who have not met eligibility criteria under IDEA <I>do</I> meet those under Section 504.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Contact sources of assistance. Each state has a Parent Training and Information Center (PTI) that is an excellent resource of information about state policy, state disability definitions, appeal procedures, and legal requirements of both IDEA and Section 504. Another resource available to parents, particularly those in disagreement with the school system, is the Protection and Advocacy (P&amp;A) Agency within the state, which can provide guidance and assistance. Both of these organizations are listed on the NICHCY <I>State Resource Sheet</I>. Trained advocates with private consulting businesses also exist in many areas.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Become familiar with federal and state laws regarding special education and the rights of children with disabilities. Numerous resources can provide this information, including NICHCY's <I>Questions and Answers About the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</I> (1993).<BR><BR>

<H3>How Can I Help My Child Improve Self-Esteem?</H3>

<P>Most undiagnosed and untreated children with AD/HD suffer from low self-esteem. Many will also show signs of being mildly depressed. These feelings stem from the child's sense of personal failure. For the child with AD/HD, the world is often an unkind place. Negative feedback in the form of punishment or blame tends to be a constant in this child's life. Early diagnosis and treatment help to stem the feelings of poor self-esteem.</P>

<P>To encourage a good sense of self this child must be helped to recognize personal strengths and to develop them. Using many of the behavior management techniques and intervention strategies described in this document will help. The child's self-esteem will improve when he or she feels competent. These are not children who can't, or won't. They can, and do. it's just that "can" and "do" come harder for them.</P>

<H3>Where Can I Find a Parent Support Group?</H3>

<P>For those parents, teachers, and children challenged by this disorder, AD/HD can be a truly unique experience. While some days the struggles seem insurmountable, it's important for parents to realize that, when AD/HD is properly managed, these children and youth can and do turn their liabilities into assets.</P>

<P>Until such time, help and hope are available. AD/HD parent support groups exist in every state. For information about a group in your area, contact CH.A.D.D. (Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorders) at 499 NW 70th Avenue, Suite 109, Plantation, FL 33317, Telephone: (305) 587-3700. If there is no parent support group in your area, the CH.A.D.D. staff can give you guidance in how to start a group. In addition, CH.A.D.D. Offers many publications, including<I> CH.A.D.D.er Box and Attention!</I></P>

<H3><I>Ways to Improve Life in General</I> <BR>
<I>and the Self-Esteem of Children with AD/HD</I></H3>

<P><B>Become Proactive.</B> Knowledge is power. Gain knowledge about the disability so you understand why and how ADD affects the child at home, in school, in social situations, and the entire family system.</P>

<P><B>Change Your Belief System.</B> Before the child can change his or her self-concept, the adults in the child's life have to change the way they view the child. Separate the child from the behavior, and then separate the child from the disability. These are not ADD children. They are children with ADD.</P>

<P><B>Act, Don't React.</B> Emotional responses such as blame and anger will diminish when you stop, look, listen, and then respond. In other words, count to ten.</P>

<P><B>Nurture Yourself.</B> Take time alone with your spouse, develop an interest or hobby, establish a regular exercise program; be good to yourself.</P>

<P><B>Catch The Chid Being Good.</B> Give your child lots of praise, encouragement, recognition, and positive attention. Reward the child for meeting expectations. Use punishment sparingly, and never ridicule the child.</P>

<P><B>Develop The Child's Sense of Competence and Responsibility.</B></P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> Identify the child's strengths and weaknesses.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Develop realistic expectations of the child.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Play to the child's strengths by building opportunities for success in the environment. Remember, you may have to structure situations carefully to make success achievable.<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI> <B>Assign special jobs</B> (feeding the family pet, mowing the lawn, decorating the house for holidays).<BR><BR>

	<LI> <B>Cultivate the child's special interests </B>(help start a card or doll collection, take trips to museums).<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> <B>Enroll the child in extracurricular activities</B> (sports, performing arts). Finding an activity best suited to your child may require trial and error. Encourage the child by attending practices and performances.<BR><BR>

	<LI><B> Play with your child.</B> Let the child choose and direct the game or activity and, if not too obvious, let the child win.<BR><BR>

<P><B>	SIGNS OF TROUBLE</B> emerged immediately, but a smattering of early complaints were laid to mere start-up wrinkles. A few uninformed parents telephoned their schools, angry that their children were creating such nonsense words as "ppdgz" because teachers were refusing to explain how to spell or sound-out words like "puppy dogs." Baffled parents were assured that "invented spelling" was part of a whole language approach that had made New Zealand the most literate country in the world. Children who grew frustrated or fell behind because the teacher was preventing them from sounding out their letters were labelled by reading specialists as "slow readers" or "learning disabled."</P>

<P>	But one very concerned--and highly influential--grandmother didn't buy those answers. Marion Joseph, chief policy analyst under former state Superintendent Wilson Riles, visited a gradeschool one spring day with her daughter to pick up her grandson's reading primer for the upcoming fall. But the women were told: "We don't do primers anymore."</P>

<P>	As Joseph recalls it, "The teacher showed us a truly beautiful storybook by Houghton Mifflin, like a book you'd have at home. And I said, `But where are the lessons? My grandson doesn't know these words.' And my daughter asked, `Can the other kids read this book?' And the teacher said, `Some can, some can't.' So we said, `Well, how will you teach the kids who can't?' And we just got this blank stare from the teacher. I realized then, we're in big trouble."</P>

<P>	Joseph, on the board of a non-profit training and policy group, the California Institute for School Improvement, began a months-long process of talking to educators to find out what was happening in the schools. "I got, almost without exception: `Oh my God, Marion, we are having a terrible time. The new reading method is not working.'" Teachers related tales to Joseph in which, "if they tried to teach phonics or word attack skills to the kids who weren't getting it from the storybook and the invented writings, bureaucrats came in from their district office and ordered a stop to it. It was terrible stuff, virtually a new religion, a cult."</P>

<P>	Joseph, perplexed over "what the heck his damn framework was trying to do," met with Honig to share her concerns. But Honig was reluctant to believe that Joseph's strange anecdotes were anything but isolated events. Honig had other problems to worry about, facing an investigation for approving a state public-private partnership with a foundation run by his wife.</P>

<P>   	Recalls Honig, "My only thought was, `Marion just can't be right.'" But Honig began to talk to other educators, and slowly discovered that his reading framework was being grossly misapplied in local schools. "I realized that Ken and Yetta Goodman and others were saying that kids can guess their way into reading, and the districts were buying it," says Honig. "What a disservice to kids. We figured it out after a year, and we tried to correct it. But we were just completely unprepared for how strong the movement was, and how many teachers believed they would be fired if they didn't comply. We never once told the districts to go whole language, whole-hog."</P>

<P>	In 1991, Honig tried to get the state Department of Education to make a midstream correction by publishing a pro-skills guide for teachers. But state officials, swept up in national accolades being bestowed upon them as "visionaries," were utterly enamored of whole language. They instead produced "Ready, Set, Read", a mere recitation of whole language philosophy. "We were sabotaged," Honig says today. Moreover, there were no state reading scores, because Gov. Deukmejian had discontinued the so-called CAP tests. As a result, Honig could not prove that kids were actually being hurt by whole language.</P>

<P>	 Says Joseph: "Once there were no state test scores, the issue of how children were doing went off the press's screen, and whole language got terrific press. And then the officials began to believe their own press."</P>

<P>	In 1992, Honig was convicted of conflict of interest charges involving his wife's foundation and was forced from office in January of 1993. But he and Joseph continued their fight from outside. Joseph recalls a particularly surreal meeting at which she and Honig tried to warn Honig's former deputy about the anti-skills hysteria overtaking the schools. "This former deputy just kept repeating this mantra about what Bill Honig had intended for California," she recalls. "Bill was sitting right there, beseeching him, saying no, no, no you've got it wrong. So nothing moved."</P>

<P>	In the end, a rudderless group of state officials were left struggling to interpret a unique and untested reading philosophy which they, themselves, did not understand. At the schools, deep divisions broke out as district bureaucrats began dictating bizarre orders to teachers and principals.</P>

<P>	At Toland Way Elementary School in Los Angeles's Eagle Rock District,the battle lines were drawn in 1992 when frustrated teachers and administrators decided to raise funds for spelling books by holding nacho sales and seeking parent donations. No spelling book had been approved by the state under the 1987 framework, meaning that no state funds could be used to buy spellers.</P>

<P>	"Some parents were really upset that we had to ask for money," recalls Janet Davis, a mentor teacher and whole language proponent who now believes "fanatics" took over the state's whole language program. Says Davis: "The parents were saying, `Why on earth isn't the district providing you the spelling books?' The district came down and just read us the riot act about that."</P>

<P>	But the real pressure came later, when a group of LAUSD "compliance officers" came into Toland Way's classrooms for three days. "We got written up for using spelling books," says Davis. "A huge controversy ensued. But we still have our nacho sales and buy our books. I don't use them, but teachers who find them effective must be allowed to use them, for God's sake. I've been joking that Toland Way will be said by district officials to be suffering a statistical anomaly when we are tested on spelling, because our kids will know how to spell and other schools won't."</P>

<P>	At Heliotrope Elementary School in Maywood, a Los Angeles suburb, teacher Patty Abarca became notorious for defying her school's ban on spelling tests and basal readers. Her war began in the early 1990s, when a now-departed vice principal, a hardcore whole language purist with little teaching experience, announced that teachers who were using traditional reading primers were "losers." Says one teacher who asked not to be named, "She said our reading program, and this is the word she used--'sucked'."</P>

<P>	When school officials threatened to punish the veteran Abarca by transferring her to another school for defying orders and fomenting staff dissent, Abarca, a union activist, merely shut her door. Says Abarca, "I wasn't ashamed to say that Dick and Jane is a wonderful story about a boy and girl and their neighborhood. And children love it."</P>

<P>	But Abarca watched in dismay as inexperienced teachers at her school and in neighboring schools became swept up in the new method. Recalls Abarca, "I will never forget these two brand-new, first-grade teachers who seemed competent but didn't have a clue how to teach reading. One of them had not been taught a single reading method in college, so I said, `You need the basal. It has a teacher's guide that will give you the basics.' And, incredibly, she said, `What is a teacher's guide?' When I told her, she shook her head and said, `No, no, we can only use literature to teach children to read. The vice principal says so."</P>

<P>	Perhaps in a state less fascinated with trying to lead the nation in "innovation," education officials might have been sufficiently alarmed by such incidents to rescind the reading framework. But instead, in 1992, when the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) announced that California's reading scores were among the worst in the nation, state education officials were dumbfounded. The fourth-graders who'd been tested had spent four years learning to read under the popular new framework. What had gone wrong?</P>

<P>	In response, a meeting of top state curriculum officials was called in 1993. There, whole language "true believers"--including the powerful California Reading Association, California Literature Project and several state officials--successfully deflected an attempt to re-emphasize basic skills in gradeschools. According to those who attended, state education officials Dennis Parker and Fred Tempest argued that teachers would "go nuts" if asked to make another big change in reading methodology. Teachers, they insisted, merely needed time to absorb whole language's unusual techniques.</P>

<P>	But several months later, in 1994, new NAEP scores were again announced, and the scope of California's reading debacle was fully revealed. Gradeschool reading levels were in a freefall, with California 4th graders beating only Louisiana and Guam. "The 1994 test scores finally got everyone's attention," says Honig. "The leaders in suits finally began to realize that they'd been sold a bill of goods."</P>

<P>	At the same time, word spread that the National Institutes of Health was completing a $25 million longitudinal series of studies of gradeschoolers--the most extensive research of reading ever conducted by the U.S.--which definitively showed that small children don't pick up reading anymore "naturally" than anthropologists learn to decipher hieroglyphics or Marines figure out the Morse code. According to research director Reid Lyon, the study found that in normal children the eye "decodes" every single letter, then melds the letters into sounds and words so effortlessly that the process cannot be observed by the human eye. Indeed, Lyon says that the very speed of the decoding process is probably what caused California's whole language proponents to claim that the mind skips over and guesses words from context. Unfortunately, they used this misbegotten belief to insist that children were being forced into "unnatural" and "joyless" skills-based reading methods.</P>

<P>	Says Lyon, "Fluent readers decode so fast that they don't even know they are tearing each word apart. It is unconscious and automatic. They spend all their time considering the meaning of what they read. But the converse is true for poor readers. Poor readers are bottled up at the data-in stage. They get only these teeny, lurching sounds as they read words. So to them, what the hell's a book? A book is a completely inaccessible object. We found that first-graders who aren't shown how to decode right away begin to feel stupid before the end of the first grade. It happens that fast."</P>

<P>	<B>ARMED WITH the 1994 scores and the NIH study,</B> advocates of basic skills launched a philosophical war on reading. Honig and others got the ear of state Superintendent Delaine Eastin, who took office in 1995 and walked, unprepared, straight into the bitter controversy. Eastin created the Reading Task Force in May of 1995 to get to the bottom of the disaster.</P>

<P>	But whole language idealogues quickly launched a public-relations counterattack. In published articles and at education conferences, whole language proponents attributed the bottomed-out reading scores to California's burgeoning population of immigrants, understocked school libraries, the national recession, and other non-curriculum factors. And they passionately attacked the NAEP test itself, arguing that whole language imparts such subtle skills to children that those skills cannot be measured, even by NAEP's widely respected mix of long, short, open-ended, and multiple-choice questions.</P>

<P>	At USC, a hotbed of whole language theory, professor Jeff McQuillan attempted to deflect the blame being placed upon whole language by pointing to California's household income drop during the recession, an influx of immigrants, and increasingly inferior school libraries, while professor Stephen Krashen released a scathing satirical essay in which he urged the teaching of phonics to newborns. "Couples considering marriage may want to have their prospective partner screened for defective phonemic awareness," Krashen scoffed. The purists angrily accused the California Department of Education of failing--despite millions of dollars spent on in-service training--to properly explain whole language to principals and teachers.</P>

<P>	On the opposing side, however, a raft of pro-skills educators poured forth, emboldened after years of being dismissed as mere fossils. They convincingly pointed out that reading levels among California's white children had dropped to the absolute bottom for their racial group in the U.S.--even below white children in Louisiana--so claiming that the poor performance of Latino immigrants had skewed California's scores was not only cynical, it was dead wrong. And pro-skills advocates revealed that New Zealand--even to this day still much ballyhooed by Sacramento education officials--had not, in fact, benefitted from whole language. Indeed, one-quarter of that country's gradeschool children could not read, and needed costly tutors. New Zealand, deeply embarrassed by its reading crisis, has begun a discomforting internal debate. Meanwhile, an international study found that New Zealand actually lagged behind the U.S. in gradeschool reading ability, despite its widely repeated claim that it was the "most literate" country in the world.</P>

<P>	"It turned out that New Zealand was behind us," says Honig, "so we had to ask, why on earth are we copying them?"</P>

<P>	Treadway, the professor at San Diego State, recently became the most prominent whole language proponent to publicly concede that whole language theory was fundamentally wrong for teaching beginning reading, even while some of its techniques, such as using rich literature and early childhood writing, were good ideas that should be retained.</P>

<P>	"In my mind," says Treadway, "we cast our eyes across the Pacific to such an extent that we ignored the findings in our own country, which said New Zealand was wrong. We felt, rather smugly, that American scientists merely had not caught up with us. We were very proud and maybe even self-righteous. We had real strong conversations with people who agreed with us from New Zealand. We validated one another in the most insular way. It was a basic, self-affirming, life affirming way to go. I don't mind saying it has been a disaster, as long as it's clear to everyone that it was done with the best of intentions by a lot of really committed people."</P>

<P>	Now the officials, consultants and scholars are sitting down in Sacramento to try to fix the mess they've created. According to Honig, at gradeschools in fad-driven areas where administrators went "whole language, whole hog," up to 30% of the children now need tutors and special intervention to catch up, and many of those schools are using extremely scarce funds to herd children into the lavishly expensive Reading Recovery tutoring system. "Officials in Sacramento and places like L.A. County are still saying beginning readers can pick up their reading skills in the context of a story, while absorbing whole ideas," says Honig. "It's like watching doctors bleed their patients." </P>

<P>	The internal resistance to reform by whole language proponents has delayed state implementation of the new reading plan backed by the Task Force, and its prospects remain unclear. In fact, high-placed whole language proponents are spreading the word to whole language purists in local districts that they "can ignore" whatever the state decides, according to several sources. Nevertheless, proponents still expect that the state will approve a plan that, while retaining some use of literature and early childhood writing, will heavily emphasize word decoding and word attack skills through the second grade, with two hours per day devoted to reading lessons.</P>

<P>	Douglas Carnine, the Oregon scholar who is advising Eastin, warns that even though her proposals are solid, teachers, like any professional group, cannot absorb continual, massive change without creating an inferior product. "California," Carnine says, "is going to suffer terribly with its continuing addiction to massive innovation. I don't know if they can see what is obvious: that California is the first to innovate, and the first to fail. They don't understand the nature of change theory. California has got to slow down. Let individual schools pick what works and prove it to their community with test scores and visible, non-fuzzy, measurable achievements. Stop trying to fix the whole damn world and end up failing to fix a single school."</P>

<P>	Moreover, the state's teacher colleges continue to reject the vast body of research into beginning reading, and are expected to stubbornly resist altering their badly deficient reading methodology courses for new teachers, experts say. In response, the state is trying to reform its official teacher certification reading requirements, thus forcing the colleges to change their ways. But that effort has only just begun.</P>

<P>	Meanwhile, California's gradeschool teachers are left to pick up the pieces from what has been an unpleasant, close-up battle in the classroom. 	At schools where administrators fought their teachers, ordering them around like naive children, it will take a long time to repair the damage to fragile, internal school cultures that tend to thrive upon mutual respect, but wither under authoritarianism.</P>

<P>	Many teachers are beginning to choose what works best for them and shrug off the worst aspects of whole language. At Toland Way Elementary School in Eagle Rock, for example, Janet Davis remains committed to the use of rich literature, invented spelling, personal journals and other techniques of whole language, but she has made concessions to traditional skills. "If phonics worked so friggin' well, do you think we would have stopped doing it?" she asks. "Older teachers were successful with a large percentage of students using their old way of teaching, but there were always kids who did not benefit. But then we lost what the old teachers knew by being so radical, and we started losing those kids too."</P>

<P>       Davis now creates her own spelling tests--over the objections of the anti-spelling LAUSD. And, as a mentor teacher, she has given her younger apprentice an old basal reader to show her how to teach basic skills.</P>

<P>	Not far away, at Los Feliz Elementary, in a first-grade ESL classroom, teacher Patricia Franco Simonowski uses a traditional reading approach with heavy homework and lots of repetition. Simonowski is one of the apparently few teachers who has read Honig's reading framework in detail. She keeps it in her classroom, where she periodically pulls it out and pores over it in disgust.</P>

<P>	"I don't think many teachers have actually benefitted from reading this thing," says Simonowski, pointing to a page of the framework. "I tried out these concepts, and I see this framework for what it is: a jobs program for tutors, reading consultants and child psychiatrists. Give me a child who has been taught simple discipline at home, and I will use what we all know about teaching reading to give you a child who can read and write fluently." She has taught fifth and sixth grades at other Los Angeles schools, and she has seen dozens of non-reading older kids--all victims, she believes, of overzealous whole language concepts. For older children, Simonowski says--and most educators agree--it is already too late. "It's pitiful out there, and I blame the experts and the textbook companies who make big bucks every time California figures out a whole new way to teach reading."</P>

<P>	Asked about the state's new reform plan, Simonowski dismisses Eastin and Honig with a wave of her hand. "Teachers and kids," she says, "have become sitting ducks."</P>

<P>	Eastin and Honig appear to be aware that teachers like Patty Simonowski, Patty Abarca and Janet Davis feel twice bitten and remain wary of any new state-driven ideas. But the two leaders--one the ultimate government insider, the other now a respected outsider--are upbeat about the state's plan and its eventual acceptance in the classroom. This time, they say, the state is going forward with its eyes open, fully informed, research in hand.</P>

<P>	"The new plan," says Honig, "is a huge improvement over what's been done for the last several years."</P>

<P>	One can only hope that he's right. Because that, of course, is what the visionaries said the last time.

<P>PHILADELPHIA, June 6 /PRNewswire/ -- In recognition of Children's Day, June 9, child care providers can honor kids by helping to prevent sickness among the children they care for. Children in child care centers average six to eight upper respiratory illnesses and about four gastrointestinal illnesses each year. A key challenge for child care administrators is minimizing the spread of germs which are transmitted most commonly and easily by contact with dirty hands. Cheryl Gelber, Director of Liability at CIGNA Property &amp; Casualty Loss Control Services, offers the following basic health and hygiene tips to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases:</P>

<p><b>Hand Washing</b></P>
 <UL TYPE=DISC>

<LI> Hands should be washed at the beginning of the day, before handling or eating food, after using the restroom, after diapering a child, and after handling other body secretions. Studies have shown that centers that require staff and children to wash their hands properly and frequently cut their incidence of gastrointestinal illnesses in half.<br><br>

<LI> It's effective to wash hands using liquid or powdered soap in a dispenser and paper towels. Using warm, running water and soap, lather both sides of hands, under fingernails, and between fingers for at least 15 seconds; rinse off all soap under running water from wrists to fingertips.<br><br>

<LI> Children and staff should dry hands with paper towels and turn off the faucet with the paper towel to avoid picking up germs on the faucet. After drying, apply hand lotion to prevent dry, cracked, or chapped hands.<br><br>
</UL>

<p><b>Surface Cleaning &amp; Sanitation</b></P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> Every child care center should clean and sanitize surface areas on a regular basis to help kill germs before they spread. Follow cleaning product instructions and be cautious when using ammonia and bleach.<br><br>

<LI> sanitize surfaces with sanitizing solution diluted with the specified amount of water; prepare a fresh batch each day.<br><br>

<LI> Keep cleaning products and sanitizing solutions out of children's reach at all times.<br><br>

</UL>

<p>The term ~CIGNA~ refers to subsidiaries of CIGNA Corporation operating as part of CIGNA Property &amp; Casualty and licensed to offer insurance products and services. CIGNA Corporation itself is not an insurer and does not issue policies. </P>

<h2> <a name="ALCOHOL">Alcohol</a></h2>

 <p>    Alcohol consumption causes a number of changes in behavior.
Even low doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination
required to drive a car safely. Low to moderate doses of alcohol
can increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts,
including spouse and child abuse. Moderate to high doses of
alcohol cause marked impairments in higher mental functions,
severely altering a person's ability to learn and remember
information. Very high doses cause respiratory depression and
death.<p>
 <p>    Continued use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Sudden
cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal
symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and
convulsions. Long-term effects of consuming large quantities of
alcohol, especially when combined with poor nutrition, can lead
to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the
liver. In addition, mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy
may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. These
infants may suffer from mental retardation and other irreversible
physical abnormalities. In addition, research indicates that
children of alcoholic parents are at greater risk than other
children of becoming alcoholics.<p>

<HR>
<p><h2> <a name="TOBACCO">Tobacco</a></h2>

<p>     The smoking of tobacco products is the chief avoidable cause
of death in our society. Smokers are more likely than nonsmokers
to contract heart disease some 170,000 die each year from
smoking-related coronary heart disease. Lung, larynx, esophageal,
bladder, pancreatic, and kidney cancers also strike smokers at
increased rates. Some 30 percent of cancer deaths (130,000 per
year) are linked to smoking. Chronic, obstructive lung diseases
such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis are 10 times more likely
to occur among smokers than among nonsmokers.<p>
 <p>    Smoking during pregnancy also poses serious risks.
Spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, low birth weights, and fetal
and infant deaths are all more likely to occur when the pregnant
woman is a smoker.<p>
 <p>    Cigarette smoke contains some 4,000 chemicals, several of
which are known carcinogens. Perhaps the most dangerous substance
in tobacco smoke is nicotine. Nicotine is the substance that
reinforces and strengthens the desire to smoke. Because nicotine
is highly addictive, addicts find it very difficult to stop
smoking. Of 1,000 typical smokers, fewer than 20 percent succeed
in stopping on the first try.<p>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<hr>
<h2> <a name="CANNABIS">Cannabis</a></h2>

   <p>  All forms of cannabis have negative physical and mental
effects. Several regularly observed physical effects of cannabis
are a substantial increase in the heart rate, bloodshot eyes, a
dry mouth and throat, and increased appetite.<p>
     Use of cannabis may impair or reduce short-term memory and
comprehension, alter sense of time, and reduce ability to perform
tasks requiring concentration and coordination, such as driving a
car. Motivation and cognition may be altered, making the
acquisition of new information difficult. Marijuana can also
produce paranoia and psychosis.<p>
 <p>    Because users often inhale the unfiltered smoke deeply and
then hold it in their lungs as long as possible, marijuana is
damaging to the lungs and pulmonary system. Marijuana smoke
contains more cancer-causing agents than tobacco smoke. Long-term
users of cannabis may develop psychological dependence and
require more of the drug to get the same effect. The drug can
become the center of their lives.<p>

<h2> <a name="INHALANTS">Inhalants</a></h2>

 <p>    The immediate negative effects of inhalants include nausea,
sneezing, coughing, nosebleeds, fatigue, lack of coordination,
and loss of appetite. Solvents and aerosol sprays also decrease
the heart and respiratory rates and impair judgment. Amyl and
butyl nitrite cause rapid pulse, headaches, and involuntary
passing of urine and feces. Long-term use may result in hepatitis
or brain damage.<p>
  <p>   Deeply inhaling the vapors, or using large amounts over a
short time, may result in disorientation, violent behavior,
unconsciousness, or death. High concentrations of inhalants can
cause suffocation by displacing the oxygen in the lungs or by
depressing the central nervous system to the point that breathing
stops.<p>
  <p>   Long-term use can cause weight loss, fatigue, electrolyte
imbalance, and muscle fatigue. Repeated sniffing of concentrated
vapors over time can permanently damage the nervous system.<p>

<h2> <a name="COCAINE">Cocaine</a></h2>

  <p>   Cocaine stimulates the central nervous system. Its immediate
effects include dilated pupils and elevated blood pressure, heart
rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Occasional use can
cause a stuffy or runny nose, while chronic use can ulcerate the
mucous membrane of the nose. Injecting cocaine with contaminated
equipment can cause AIDS, hepatitis, and other diseases.
Preparation of freebase, which involves the use of volatile
solvents, can result in death or injury from fire or explosion.<p>
 <p>    Crack or freebase rock is extremely addictive, and its
effects are felt within 10 seconds. The physical effects include
dilated pupils, increased pulse rate, elevated blood pressure,
insomnia, loss of appetite, tactile hallucinations, paranoia, and
seizure. The use of cocaine can cause death by cardiac arrest or
respiratory failure.<p>

<h2> <a name="OTHER STIMULANTS">Other Stimulants</a></h2>

 <p>    Stimulants can cause increased heart and respiratory rates,
elevated blood pressure, dilated pupils, and decreased appetite.
In addition, users may experience sweating, headache, blurred
vision, dizziness, sleeplessness, and anxiety. Extremely high
doses can cause a rapid or irregular heartbeat, tremors, loss of
coordination, and even physical collapse. An amphetamine
injection creates a sudden increase in blood pressure that can
result in stroke, very high fever, or heart failure.<p>
  <p>   In addition to the physical effects, users report feeling
restless, anxious, and moody. Higher doses intensify the effects.
Persons who use large amounts of amphetamines over a long period
of time can develop an amphetamine psychosis that includes
hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. These symptoms usually
disappear when drug use ceases.<p>

<h2> <a name="DEPRESSANTS">Depressants</a></h2>

 <p>    The effects of depressants are in many ways similar to the
effects of alcohol. Small amounts can produce calmness and
relaxed muscles, but larger doses can cause slurred speech,
staggering gait, and altered perception. Very large doses can
cause respiratory depression, coma, and death. The combination of
depressants and alcohol can multiply the effects of the drugs,
increasing the risks.<p>
 <p>    Regular use of depressants over time can result in physical
and psychological addiction. People who suddenly stop taking
large doses can experience withdrawal symptoms, including
anxiety, insomnia, tremors, delirium, convulsions, and death.
Babies born to mothers who abuse depressants may also be
physically dependent on the drugs and show withdrawal symptoms
shortly after they are born. Birth defects and behavioral
problems also may result.<p>

<h2> <a name="HALLUCINOGENS">Hallucinogens</a></h2>

 <p>    Phencyclidine (PCP) interrupts the functions of the
neocortex, the section of the brain that controls the intellect
and keeps instincts in check. Because the drug blocks pain
receptors, violent PCP episodes may result in self-inflicted
injuries. The effects of PCP vary, but users frequently report a
sense of distance and estrangement. Time and body movement are
slowed down. Muscular coordination worsens and senses are dulled.
Speech is blocked and incoherent. In later stages of chronic use,
users often exhibit paranoid and violent behavior and experience
hallucinations. Large doses may produce convulsions and coma, as
well as heart and lung failure.<p>
  <p>   Lysergic acid (LSD), mescaline, and psilocybin cause
illusions and hallucinations. The physical effects may include
dilated pupils, elevated body temperature, increased heart rate
and blood pressure, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and tremors.
The user may experience panic, confusion, suspicion, anxiety, and
loss of control. Delayed effects, or flashbacks, can occur even
when use has ceased.<p>

<h2> <a name="NARCOTICS">Narcotics</a></h2>

  <p>   Narcotics initially produce a feeling of euphoria that often
is followed by drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting. Users also may
experience constricted pupils, watery eyes, and itching. An
overdose may produce slow and shallow breathing, clammy skin,
convulsions, coma, and possible death.<p>
    <p> Tolerance to narcotics develops rapidly and dependence is
likely. The use of contaminated syringes may result in disease
such as AIDS, endocarditis, and hepatitis. Addiction in pregnant
women can lead to premature, stillborn, or addicted infants who
experience severe withdrawal symptoms.<p>

<h2> <a name="DESIGNER DRUGS">Designer Drugs</a></h2>

   <p>  Illegal drugs are defined in the terms of their chemical
formulas. To circumvent these legal restriction underground
chemists modify the molecular structure of certain illegal drugs
to produce analogs known as designer drugs. These drugs can be
several hundred times stronger than the drugs they are designed
to imitate.<p>
 <p>    The narcotic analogs can cause symptoms such as those seen
in Parkinson's disease: uncontrollable tremors, drooling,
impaired speech, paralysis, and irreversible brain damage.
Analogs of amphetamines and methamphetamines cause nausea,
blurred vision, chills or sweating, and faintness. Psych logical
effects include anxiety, depression, and paranoia. As little as
one dose can cause brain damage The analogs of phencyclidine
cause illusions, hallucinations, and impaired perception.<p>

<h2> <a name="ANABOLIC STEROIDS">Anabolic Steroids</a></h2>

  <p>   Anabolic steroids are a group of powerful compounds closely
related to the male sex hormone testosterone. Developed in the
1930's, steroids are seldom prescribed by physicians today.
Current legitimate medical uses are limited to certain kinds of
anemia, severe burns, and some types of breast cancer.<p>
 <p>    Taken in combination with a program of muscle-building
exercise and diet, steroids may contribute to increases in body
weight and muscular strength. Steroid users subject themselves to
more than 70 side effects ranging in severity from liver cancer
to acne and including psychological as well as physical
reactions. The liver and cardiovascular and reproductive systems
are most seriously affected by steroid use. In males, use can
cause withered testicles, sterility, and impotence. In females,
irreversible masculine traits can develop along with breast
reduction and sterility. Psychological effects in both sexes
include very aggressive behavior known as "roid rage" and
depression. While some side effects appear quickly, others, such
as heart attacks and strokes, may not show up for years.<p>
<p>     Signs of steroid use include quick weight and muscle gains
(when used in a weight training program); aggressiveness and
combativeness; jaundice; purple or red spots on the body;
swelling of feet and lower legs; trembling; unexplained darkening
of the skin; and persistent unpleasant breath odor.<p>

<H3> Fact Sheet</H3>

<P> Between 1996 and 2006....... </P>

<UL>

     	<LI>Total public and private school enrollment will rise from a
     	record 51.7 million to 54.6 million;

     	<LI>Public high school enrollment is expected to increase by 15
     	percent;

     	<LI>The number of high school graduates will increase 17 percent,
     	14 percent by 2001;

     	<LI>About half of the states will have at least a 15 percent
     increase in the number of high school graduates, with the
     Western states having almost a 30 percent increase in high
     	school graduates;

     	<LI>College enrollment is projected to rise by 14 percent;

     	<LI>Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans will be the fastest
     	growing segments of the student population.
	
</UL>

<P> To maintain current K-12 student service levels in 2006, 
 the nation will need about.....</P>

<UL>
     	<LI>190,000 additional teachers;

     	<LI>Over 6,000 more schools; 

     	<LI>Approximately $15 billion in additional annual operating expenditures.
	
</UL>

<P> By 2030, the maturing of the baby boom echo generation will
 stabilize a long-term decline in the ratio of workers to retirees
 at 2.6 to 1.</P>
<hr>
<a name="Case1"></a>
<H3>Case Study #1</H3>

<P>The rolling hills of Loudoun County, Va., mark the
beginning of horse country west of Washington, D.C., but the
county's emergence as a bedroom community for the nation's capital
has school enrollments growing at a gallop.</P>

<P>     Loudoun County's under-19 population has grown almost 40
percent in the last four years and is expected to continue growing. 
Loudoun County's enrollment is projected to grow over the next five
years from 21,955 students this fall (the first time that Loudoun
County eclipsed the 20,000 mark) to 34,762 students in 2001-02. 
Besides four schools that are now under construction, the
district's six-year capital improvement plan calls for the
construction of 11 elementary schools, two middle schools and three
high schools, as well as more than $22 million in technology
investments over the next three years.  District planners say that
the growth is spurred by the county's influx of young families. 
The number of kindergartners entering the system annually exceeds
the number of high school graduates by several hundred.</P>

<P>     There are no signs of the growth rate letting up anytime soon. 
New home construction continues to grow in Loudoun County, and
county zoning officials have opened the way for developers to build
another 53,000 residential units.</P>

 <hr>
<a name="Case2"></a>
<H3>Case Study #2</H3>

<P> For more than a decade, the Clark County, Nev.,
School District has ranked among the fastest growing districts in
the nation.  Enrollment in Clark County has almost doubled over the
last decade, growing from 95,416 students in 1986-87 to an
enrollment of 179,169 for the coming school year.  Clark County
Superintendent Brian Cram, who will oversee the opening of 15 new
schools in the next two years, expects enrollment in his district
to top a quarter of a million students by 2002.</P>

<P>     Managing and financing such explosive growth is a constant
concern for the district.  Voters approved a $605 million bond
issue in 1994 to finance the construction of 24 new schools and
renovations at 114 existing schools.  Those projects are already
inadequate to meet the needs of the district, which is going back
to the voters this fall seeking a $643 million bond issue.</P>

<P>     A key component of the district's growth management strategy
is a cooperative working relationship between the district and the
City of Las Vegas.  The city paid for infrastructure costs such as
streets, sewers, and athletic fields at some new campuses, while
the district opens schools to city residents for athletics and day
care when schools are not in session.</P>

 <hr>
<a name="Case3"></a>
<H3>Case Study #3</H3>

<P>Fast-paced growth is an Olympic-sized issue for the
Gwinnett County, Ga., Public Schools northeast of Atlanta. 
Gwinnett County school officials expect that their district will
become the largest in Georgia by the end of the decade.</P>

<P>     Overcrowded schools are already a problem there as 30 Gwinnett
County schools enroll at least 100 students more than their
designed capacity.  To maintain current class sizes, Gwinnett
County needs to build 778 classrooms by the end of the decade, and
hire about 570 new teachers annually -- more than 300 of whom will
be recruited for newly created positions.</P>

<P>     Gwinnett County Superintendent Alvin Wilbanks says that a
major challenge in managing that growth is to build schools that
are not too big.  He cited a new Gwinnett middle school that will
open this fall to an enrollment of 2,150 students -- a larger
figure than he wants, but a move that is necessitated by the influx
of new students.</P>

<P>     The impact of fast growth across Georgia led the state
legislature to place a referendum on the November ballot asking
voters whether to allow local school boards to seek a temporary
sales tax increase as a way to finance school construction.</P>

<hr>
<a name="Case4"></a>
<H3>Case Study #4</H3>

<P>The Broward County, Fla., Public Schools already
ranks among the largest school systems in the nation with more than
218,000 students, and it continues to grow at a phenomenal rate. 
Although the district added 37 new schools and refurbished many
existing schools over the past seven years, the district's
projected capital needs over the next seven years total $2.4
billion.  Funding from identifiable sources to date totals only $1
billion, leaving a projected shortfall of $1.4 billion.</P>

<P>     Portable classrooms are such a commonplace part of the school
system that some refer to Broward County as the "portable capital
of the world" -- 2,144 portable classrooms are in use there. 
Thousands of other students attend classes in areas intended to be
music and science rooms, labs, auditoriums, and other makeshift
areas.  Broward officials say that the district is adding 10,000
students a year.  Broward's proximity to Miami, one of our nation's
gateway cities, means that many of these children are recent
immigrants. </P>

<P>     Meanwhile, the space crunch is impeding the system's efforts
to make greater use of technology in the classroom.  The goal of
Broward Superintendent Frank Petruzielo is to provide a minimum of
four computers in every classroom for student use and one computer
for teacher use.  Petruzielo says that the goal is not reachable in
the near future under the system's current funding outlook. </P>

<P>     Readiness is a term used to describe preparation for what
comes next: readiness for kindergarten involves both the child
and the instructional situation. Any consideration of the
preparation a child needs to be successful in kindergarten must
take into account the kindergarten program and the teacher's
expectations of the child. </P>
<a name="Social"></a>
<H3>Social and Behavioral Expectations</H3>

<P>     Kindergarten teachers expect that the children will be able
to function within a cooperative learning environment in which
the child works both independently and as a member of small and
large groups. Children are expected to be able to attend to and
finish a task, listen to a story in a group, follow two or three
oral directions, take turns and share, and care for their
belongings. They are also expected to follow rules, respect the
property of others, and work within the time and space
constraints of the school program. It is important that children
learn to distinguish between work and play, knowing when and
where each is appropriate within the definition of each (Bradley,
1984; LeCompte, 1980).</P>

<hr>
<a name="Sensory"></a>
<H3>Sensory-Motor Expectations</H3>

<P>     Teachers expect children to develop certain physical skills
before they enter kindergarten. Children are expected to have
mastered many large muscle skills such as walking, running, and
climbing, and fine motor skills requiring eye-hand coordination,
such as use of a pencil, crayons, or scissors. Fine motor skills
are used when the child begins to write its name and to make
attempts at written expression. It is assumed that children have
acquired both visual and auditory discrimination of objects and
sounds. Such discrimination skills will be used to learn the
names and sounds of letters and the names and quantities of
numerals. Children are expected to have developed the concepts of
same and different, so that they can sort objects into groups
whose members are alike in some way. Usually the kindergarten
teacher expects the children to recognize and name colors,
shapes, sizes, and their own names (even though these concepts
are often part of the curriculum early in the school year).</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>
<a name="Cognitive"></a>
<H3>Cognitive and Language Expectations</H3>

<P>     Most five-year-olds can express themselves fluently with a
variety of words and can understand an even larger variety of
words used in conversations and stories. If children have been
exposed to books and heard stories read and told, they have begun
to develop an interest in what print says and how it is used to
express ideas; a concept of story and story structure; and an
understanding of the relationship between oral and written
language.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>
<a name="Chronological"></a>
<H3>Chronological Age</H3>

<P>     Many school systems and states have raised the entrance age
for kindergarten in hopes that the older age of the class will
increase the likelihood of the children's success. However,
research does not support this action. Most studies show that
chronological age alone is not a factor in success in
kindergarten (Meisels, 1987; Wood, 1984).</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>
<a name="Kindergarten"></a>
<H3>Kindergarten Curriculum</H3>

<P>     Many children now have a prior group experience in nursery
school, prekindergarten, or day care. In the past, when
kindergarten was the child's initial school experience, its focus
was on the child's social adjustment to school. Kindergarten was
usually a half-day program whose curriculum and activities were
separate from the rest of the school, and whose purpose was to
prepare the child for first grade. Now kindergarten is an
integral part of the elementary school's curriculum and the focus
has shifted from social to cognitive or academic (Nurss and
Hodges, 1982). Many states fund full-day kindergarten programs on
the assumption that five-year-olds can benefit from a longer
school experience. Kindergartens vary in the degree to which
their cognitive skills are strengthened through a developmentally
oriented program with language-based, concrete activities. In
many kindergartens, language, cognitive, sensory-motor, and
social-emotional skills are addressed through play. Small group
instruction, learning centers, and whole group language
activities are used as systematic, planned opportunities for the
children to develop in all areas.</P>

<P>     In some cases, however, the kindergarten uses structured,
whole group, paper-and-pencil activities oriented to academic
subjects, such as reading and mathematics. The curriculum in
these kindergartens often constitutes a downward extension of the
primary grade curriculum and may call for the use of workbooks
which are part of a primary level textbook series. Many early
childhood professionals have spoken out on the inappropriateness
of such a curriculum and have urged widespread adoption of a
developmentally appropriate kindergarten curriculum (Bredekamp,
1986).</P>

<P>     The question of readiness for kindergarten depends in part
on which type of program the child enters. Different approaches
to reading and writing, for example, make different demands on a
young child. A child may be ready for one type of instructional
program, but not another.</P>

<P>     A further issue is that of the expectations of the teachers
and school system for what the child will accomplish by the end
of kindergarten. As expectations become more academic and
assessments more formal (for example, standardized tests that
compare children to a national sample of kindergarten children)
pressure increases to retain children who do not meet
expectations or to place them in a transition class between
kindergarten and first grade. The assumption is that children who
have not achieved a minimum level of cognitive and academic
skills prior to first grade will benefit from another year of
kindergarten. While that may be true for some, it is not true for
many others (Shepard, 1987). Developmentally appropriate
programs assume that children vary upon entrance; that all
children progress during the program at their own rates and in
their own manner; and that children will continue to vary at the
end of the program.</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>     Readiness for kindergarten depends on a child's development
of social, perceptual, motor, and language skills expected by the
teacher. It also depends on the curriculum's degree of structure,
the behavior required by the instructional program, and
expectations of what is to be achieved by the end of the program.</P>

<P>The idea for this publication was suggested by Diane
Ravitch when she presented her vision of OERI to the education
community. This book was prepared under the direction of
Francie Alexander; Cynthia Hearn Dorfman, Chief, Publications
Branch; and Theodor Rebarber, Special Assistant, Office of the
Assistant Secretary; with help from John B. Lyons, Thelma
Leenhouts, Barbara Lieb, Eve Bither, Gerard Devlin, Tim Burr,
Liz Barnes, and Elizabeth DeBra. The book is based on the
award-winning design by Margery Martin and Phil Carr.</P>
<HR>

<a name="Foreword"></a>
<H2>Foreword</H2>


     "Why"
<br><br>
     This is the question we parents are always trying to
answer. It's good that children ask questions: that's the best
way to learn. All children have two wonderful resources for
learning--imagination and curiosity. As a parent, you can
awaken your children to the joy of learning by encouraging
their imagination and curiosity.
<br><br>
     Helping Your Child Get Ready for School is one in a series
of books on different education topics intended to help you
make the most of your child's natural curiosity. Teaching and
learning are not mysteries that can only happen in school. They
also happen when parents and children do simple things
together.
<br><br>
     For instance, you and your child can: sort the socks on
laundry day--sorting is a major function in math and science;
cook a meal together--cooking involves not only math and
science but good health as well; tell and read each other
stories--storytelling is the basis for reading and writing (and
a story about the past is also history); or play a game of
hopscotch together--playing physical games will help your child
learn to count and start on a road to lifelong fitness.
<br><br>
     By doing things together, you will show that learning is
fun and important. You will be encouraging your child to study,
learn, and stay in school.
<br><br>
     All of the books in this series tie in with the National
Education Goals set by the President and the Governors. The
goals state that, by the year 2000: every child will start
school ready to learn; at least 90 percent of all students will
graduate from high school; each American student will leave the
4th, 8th, and 12th grades demonstrating competence in core
subjects; U.S. students will be first in the world in math and
science achievement; every American adult will be literate,
will have the skills necessary to compete in a global economy,
and will be able to exercise the rights and responsibilities of
citizenship; and American schools will be liberated from drugs
and violence so they can focus on learning.
<br><br>
     This book is a way for you to help meet these goals. It
will give you a short rundown on facts, but the biggest part of
the book is made up of simple, fun activities for you and your
child to do together. Your child may even beg you to do them.
<br><br>
     As U.S. Education Secretary Lamar Alexander has said:
<br><br>
     The first teachers are the parents, both by example
     and conversation. But don't think of it as teaching. Think
     of it as fun.
<br><br>
     So, let's get started. I invite you to find an activity in
this book and try it.

<H2>Learning Begins Early</H2>


     The road to success in school begins early. Good health,
loving relationships, and opportunities to learn all help
preschool children do well later in life. But many parents
wonder, "How can I give these things to my child?"
<br><br>
     This book is for all of you who have asked this question.
It's for parents, grandparents, and others who want to know
what to do to help young children get ready for school.
Throughout the preschool years, you can do many simple things
to help your child grow, develop, and have fun learning. This
book:
<ul>
   <li>Describes the qualities and skills that youngsters need to
     get a good start in kindergarten;

   <li>Tells what to expect from preschoolers each year from
     birth to age 5;

   <li>Suggests easy activities that help children grow and
     develop; and

   <li>Explains how to encourage enthusiasm toward school and
     teachers and make it easier for children to adjust to
     kindergarten.
</ul>

     Special sections in the back of the book tell how to
monitor television viewing and find good programs; and explain
how to find suitable child care.
<br><br>
     Parents and caregivers are busy people. Most of us have
many responsibilities: jobs outside the home, laundry to wash,
and groceries to buy. When we are tired and under stress, it's 
often hard to feel we are being the best parents.               
<br><br>                      
     But however busy we may be, there are lots of things we
can do to help our children get ready for school--little things
that make a big difference. Many of them cost little or nothing
and can be done as you go about your daily routines.
<br><br>
     Mothers and fathers aren't the only people who help
children get ready for school. Entire communities share this
job. Businesses, schools, government agencies, and religious
and civic organizations help out. So do day care providers,
doctors and other health professionals, elected officials,
relatives, and neighbors. But no one is more important than
parents, because life's most basic lessons are learned early
and at home. The first 5 years are when the groundwork for
future development is laid.<BR><BR>

<a name="Ready"></a>
<H2>What Does It Mean To Be Ready for School?</H2>


     There is no one quality or skill that children need to do
well in school, but a combination of things contributes to
success. These include good health and physical wellbeing,
social and emotional maturity, language skills, an ability to
solve problems and think creatively, and general knowledge
about the world.
<br><br>
     As you go about helping your child develop in each of
these areas, remember
<ul>
   <li>Children develop at different rates, and

   <li>Most children are stronger in some areas than in others.
</ul>

     Remember, too, that being ready for school depends partly
on what the school expects. One school may think it's very
important for children to sit quietly and know the alphabet.
Another may believe it's more important for children to get
along well with others.
<br><br>
     Children who match the school's expectations may be
considered better prepared. You may want to visit your child's
school to learn what the principal and teachers expect and
discuss any areas of disagreement.
<br><br>
     While schools may have different priorities, most
educators agree that the following areas are important for
success.<BR>

<H3>Good Health and Physical Well-Being</H3>


     Young children need nutritious food, enough sleep, safe
places to play, and regular medical care. These things help
children get a good start in life and lessen the chances that
they will later have serious health problems or trouble
learning.

<br><br>

     Good health for children begins before birth with good
prenatal care. Visit a doctor or medical clinic throughout your
pregnancy. In addition, eat nourishing foods, avoid alcohol,
tobacco, and other harmful drugs, and get plenty of rest.
<br><br>
     Pregnant women who don't take good care of themselves
increase their chances of giving birth to children who
<ul>
   <li>Are low in birth weight, making them more likely to have
     lifelong health and learning problems;

   <li>Develop asthma;

   <li>Are mentally retarded;

   <li>Develop speech and language problems;

   <li>Have short attention spans; or

   <li>Become hyperactive.
</ul>

     If your child already has some of these problems, it is a
good idea to consult your doctor, your school district, or
community agencies as soon as possible. Many communities have
free or inexpensive services to help you and your child.
<br><br>
     Good health for children continues after birth with a
balanced diet. School-aged children can concentrate better in
class if they eat nutritionally balanced meals. These should
include breads, cereals, and other grain products; fruits;
vegetables; meat, poultry, fish and alternatives (such as eggs
and dried beans and peas); and milk, cheese, and yogurt. Avoid
too many fats and sweets.
<br><br>
     Children aged 2-5 generally can eat the same foods as
adults but in smaller portions. Your child's doctor or clinic
can provide advice on feeding babies and toddlers under the age
of 2.
<br><br>
     Federal, state, and local aid is available for parents who
need food in order to make sure their children get a balanced
diet. The federal nutrition program, called the Special
Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children
(WIC), distributes food to more than 5.4 million low-income
women and their children through about 8,200 service centers
across the country. Food stamps also are available for many
families with children. For information and to find out if you
are eligible, contact your local or state health department.
<br><br>
     Preschoolers require regular medical and dental checkups
and immunizations. It's important to find a doctor or a clinic
where children can receive routine health care as well as
special treatment if they are sick or injured.
<br><br>
     Children need immunizations beginning around the age of 2
months to prevent nine diseases: measles, mumps, German measles
(rubella), diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Hib
(Haemophilus influenzae type b), polio, and tuberculosis. These
diseases can have serious effects on physical and mental
development. Regular dental checkups should begin at the latest
by the age of 3.
<br><br>
     Preschoolers need opportunities to exercise and develop
physical coordination. To learn to control large muscles,
children need to throw balls, run, jump, climb, and dance to
music. To learn to control small muscles, particularly in the
hands and fingers, they need to color with crayons, put
together puzzles, use blunt-tipped scissors, and zip jackets.
In kindergarten, they will build upon these skills.
<br><br>
     Parents of youngsters with disabilities should see a
doctor as soon as a problem is suspected. Early intervention
can help these children develop to their full potential.


<H3>Social and Emotional Preparation</H3>

     Young children are often very excited about entering
school. But when they do, they can face an environment that's
different from what they are used to at home or even in
preschool. In kindergarten, they will need to work well in
large groups and get along with new adults and other children.
They will have to share the teacher's attention with other
youngsters. The classroom routines may also be different.
<br><br>
     Most 5-year-olds do not start school with good social
skills or much emotional maturity. These take time and practice
to learn. However, children improve their chances for success
in kindergarten if they have had opportunities to begin
developing these qualities:
<br><br>
     <STRONG>Confidence.</STRONG>Children must learn to feel good about
themselves and believe they can succeed. Confident children are
more willing to attempt new tasks--and try again if they don't
succeed the first time.
<br><br>
     <STRONG>Independence. </STRONG>Children need to learn to do things for
themselves.
<br><br>
     <STRONG>Motivation.</STRONG> Children must want to learn.
<br><br>
     <STRONG>Curiosity.</STRONG> Children are naturally curious and must remain
so in order to get the most out of learning opportunities.
<br><br>
     <STRONG>Persistence. </STRONG>Children must learn to finish what they
start.
<br><br>
     <STRONG>Cooperation.</STRONG> Children must be able to get along with
others and learn to share and take turns.
<br><br>
     <STRONG>Self-control.</STRONG> Preschoolers must understand that some
behaviors, such as hitting and biting, are inappropriate. They
need to learn that there are good and bad ways to express
anger.
<br><br>
     <STRONG>Empathy.</STRONG> Children must learn to have an interest in others
and understand how others feel.
<br><br>
     Parents, even more than child care centers and good
schools, help children develop these skills. Here are some ways
you can help your child acquire these positive qualities:
<br><br>
     Youngsters must believe that, no matter what, someone will
look out for them. Show that you care about your children. They
thrive when they have parents or other caregivers who are
loving and dependable. Small children need attention,
encouragement, hugs, and plenty of lap time. Children who feel
loved are more likely to be confident.
<br><br>
     Set a good example. Children imitate what they see others
do and what they hear others say. When parents exercise and eat
nourishing food, children are more likely to do so. When
parents treat others with respect, their children probably
will, too. If parents share things, their children will learn
to be thoughtful of others' feelings.
<br><br>
     Have a positive attitude toward learning and toward
school. Children come into this world with a powerful need to
discover and to explore. Parents need to encourage this
curiosity if children are to keep it. Enthusiasm for what
children do ("You've drawn a great picture!") helps to make
them proud of their achievements.
<br><br>
     Children also become excited about school when their
parents show excitement. As your child approaches kindergarten,
talk to him about school. Talk about the exciting activities in
kindergarten, such as going on field trips and making fun art
projects. Be enthusiastic as you describe what he will learn in
school--how to read and measure and weigh things, for example.
<br><br>
     Provide opportunities for repetition. It takes practice to
crawl, pronounce new words, or drink from a cup. Children don't
get bored when they repeat things. Instead, repeating things
until they are learned helps youngsters build the confidence
needed to try something new.
<br><br>
     Use appropriate discipline. All children need to have
limits set for them. Children whose parents give firm but
loving discipline are generally more skilled socially and do
better in school than children whose parents set too few or too
many limits. Here are some tips.
<ul>
   <li>Direct children's activities, but don't make unnecessary
     restrictions or try to dominate.

   <li>Offer reasons when asking your child to do something (For
     example, say, "Please move the toy truck off the stairs so
     no one falls over it"--not, "Do it because I said so.").

   <li>Listen to your children to find out how they feel and
     whether they need any special support.

   <li>Show love and respect when you are angry. Criticize a
     child's behavior but not the child (For example, say, "I
     love you, but it is not okay for you to draw pictures on
     the walls. I get angry when you do that.").

   <li>Help your children make choices and work out problems (You
     might ask your 4-year-old, "What can we do to keep Kevin
     from knocking over your blocks?").          

   <li>Be positive and encouraging. Praise your child for a job
     well done. Smiles and encouragement go much further to
     shape good behavior than harsh punishment.
</ul>
     Let children do many things by themselves. Young children
need to be closely watched. But they learn to be independent
and to develop confidence by doing tasks such as dressing
themselves and putting their toys away. It's also important to
let them make choices, rather than deciding everything for
them. Remember to give them a choice only when there really is
one.
<br><br>
     Encourage your children to play with other children and be
with adults who are not family members. Preschoolers need these
social opportunities to learn to see the point of view of
others. Young children are more likely to get along with
teachers and classmates if they already have had experiences
with different adults and children.

<H3>Language and General Knowledge</H3>

     Kindergarteners participate in many activities that
require them to use language and to solve problems. Children
who can't or don't communicate easily may have problems in
school. There are many things you can do to help children learn
to communicate, solve problems, and develop an understanding of
the world. 
<br><br>
You can give your child opportunities to play. Play is how
children learn. It is the natural way for them to explore, to
become creative, and to develop academic and social skills.
Play helps them learn to solve problems--for example, a wagon
tips over, and children must figure out how to get it upright
again. Children learn about geometry, shapes, and balance when
they stack up blocks. Playing with others helps children learn
how to negotiate.
<br><br>

     Talk to your children, beginning at birth. Babies need to
hear your voice. A television or the radio can't take the place
of your voice because it doesn't respond to coos and babbles.
The more you talk to your baby, the more he will have to talk
about as he gets older. Talking with children broadens their
understanding of language and of the world.
<br><br>
     Everyday activities, such as eating dinner or taking a
bath, provide opportunities to talk, sometimes in detail, about
what's happening and respond to your child. "First let's stick
the plug in the drain. Now we'll turn on the water. I see you
want to put your rubber duck in the bathtub. That's a good
idea. Look, it's yellow, just like the rubber duck on 'Sesame
Street.'"
<br><br>
     Listen to your children. Children have their own special
thoughts and feelings, joys and sorrows, hopes and fears. As
their language skills develop, encourage them to talk.
Listening is the best way to learn what's on their minds and to
discover what they know and don't know, and how they think and
learn. It also shows children that their feelings and ideas are
valuable.
<br><br>
     Answer questions and ask questions, particularly ones that
require more than a "yes" or "no" response. While walking in a
park, for example, most 2- and 3-year-olds will stop to pick up
leaves. You might point out how the leaves are the same, and
how they are different. With older children you might ask,
"What else grows on trees?"
<br><br>
     Questions can help children learn to compare and classify
things. Answer your children's questions thoughtfully and,
whenever possible, encourage them to answer their own
questions. If you don't know the answer to a question, say so.
Then together with your child try to find the answer.
<br><br>
     Read aloud to your children every day. Reading can begin
with babies and continue throughout the preschool years. Even
though they don't understand the story or the poem, reading
together gives children a chance to learn about language, enjoy
the sound of your voice, and be close to you. You don't have to
be an excellent reader for your child to enjoy this time
together. You may also want to take your child to a local
library that offers special story hours.
<br><br>
     Make reading materials available. Children develop an
interest in language and in reading much sooner if they have
books and other reading materials around their homes.
<br><br>
     Monitor television viewing. Next to parents, television
may be our children's most influential teacher. Good television
can introduce children to new worlds and promote learning, but
poor or too much TV can be harmful.
<br><br>
     Be realistic about your children's abilities and
interests. Children usually do best in school when parents
estimate their abilities correctly. Parents must set high
standards and encourage their preschoolers to try new things.
Children who aren't challenged become bored. But ones who are
pushed along too quickly, or are asked to do things that don't
interest them, can become frustrated and unhappy.
<br><br>
     Try to keep your children from being labeled. Labels such
as "dumb" or "stupid" have a powerful effect on a child's
confidence and school performance. Remember to praise your
child for a job well done.
<br><br>
     Provide opportunities to do and see things. The more
varied the experiences that children have, the more they learn
about the world. No matter where you live, your community can
provide new experiences. Go for walks in your neighborhood, or
go places on the bus. Visit museums, libraries, zoos, and other
community resources.
<br><br>
     If you live in the city, spend a day in the country (or if
you live in the country, spend a day in the city). Let your
children hear and make music, dance, and paint. Let them
participate in activities that help to develop their
imaginations and let them express their ideas and feelings. The
following activities can provide your children with these
opportunities.

<H2>Activities</H2>

     The activities in this section are simple and are designed
to prepare children for school. Most of them grow out of the
routine things parents do everyday.
<br><br>
     Each section is organized by ages. An age grouping begins
with "What to expect"--a list of qualities and behaviors
typical of these children. This is followed by "What they
need"--a list of things that help these children grow and
learn. In a box near the end of each activity are explanations
for those who want them. As you go through this section, it is
good to remember these points:
<br><br>
     Children learn at their own pace. Most move through
similar developmental stages, but they have their own
timetables. Therefore, the "What to expect" and the "What they
need" sections, as well as the ages suggested for the
activities, will vary from child to child. An activity listed
for a youngster between the ages of 2 and 3 may be fine for one
who is younger. Or it may not interest another until he has
passed his third birthday.
<br><br>
     Some of these activities, while listed under a particular
age, are important for all young children. Reading and
listening to music, for example, can benefit children from the
time they are born. By modifying an activity, you can enable
your child to continue to enjoy it as he grows and develops.
<br><br>
The symbols next to the activities can guide you.

<br><br>
     Find activities that interest your child. If the one you
picked out is too hard, your child may get discouraged. If it's
too easy, he may get bored. Or if your child seems
uninterested, try another time. Often children's interests
change as they grow and develop. Try to give toddlers and older
children a choice of activities so they learn to think for
themselves.
<br><br>
     The activities are meant to be fun. Be enthusiastic and
avoid lecturing to preschoolers on what they are learning. If
your child enjoys the activity, his excitement for learning
will increase.
<br><br>
     Finally, be sure to make safety a top priority. With that
caution in mind, flip through the following pages and find some
activities that you and your child can enjoy together.<BR><BR>

<H4>What to expect</H4>


     Babies grow and change dramatically during their first
year. They begin to
<ul>
   <li>Develop some control over their bodies. They learn to hold
     up their heads; roll over; sit up; crawl; stand up; and,
     in some cases, walk.

   <li>Become aware of themselves as separate from others. They
     learn to look at their hands and toes and play with them.
     They learn to cry when parents leave, and they recognize
     their name.

   <li>Communicate and develop language skills. First babies cry
     and make throaty noises. Later they babble and say mama
     and dada. Then they make lots of sounds and begin to name
     a few close people and objects.

   <li>Play games. First they play with their hands. Later they
     show an interest in toys, enjoy "putting in and taking
     out" games, and eventually carry around or hug dolls or
     stuffed toys.

   <li>Relate to others. First they respond to adults more than
     to other babies. Later they notice other babies but tend
     to treat them like objects instead of people. Then they
     pay attention when other babies cry.
</ul>

<H3>What they need</H3>


     Babies require
<ul>
   <li>A loving caregiver who can respond to their cries and
     gurgles;

   <li>Someone who gets to know their special qualities;

   <li>Someone to keep them safe and comfortable;

   <li>Opportunities to move about and practice new physical
     skills;

   <li>Safe objects to look at, bat, grab, bang, pat, roll, and
     examine;

   <li>Safe play areas; and

   <li>Opportunities to hear language and to make sounds.<BR><BR>

<H3>Developing Trust</H3>

     Newborn babies need to become attached to at least one
person who provides security and love. This first and most
basic emotional attachment is the start for all human
relationships.

<br><br>
<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>

<ul>
<li>Loving arms 
<li>Music
</ul>


<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
 <li>Include happy rituals in your baby's schedule. For
     example, at bedtime, sing the same song every night, rock
     her, or rub her tummy.

 <li>Pick up your crying baby promptly. Try to find out what's
     wrong. Is she hungry?. Wet? Bored? Too hot? Crying is your
     baby's way of communicating. By comforting her you send
     the message that language has a purpose and that someone
     wants to understand.

 <li>Gently move your newborn's arms and legs. Or tickle her
     lightly under the chin or on the tummy. When she starts to
     control her head, lie on the floor and put her on your
     chest. Let her reach for your nose or grab your hair. Talk
     to her and name each thing she touches.

 <li>Sing and cuddle with your baby. Hold her snuggled in your
     arms or lying face up on your lap with her head on your
     knees. Make sure the head of a newborn is well-supported.
     Sing a favorite lullaby.
<br><br>
     To entertain your baby, sing an active song. For example:
<ul>
      <li>If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands!<br>
      <li>If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands!<br>
      <li>If you're happy and you know it, and you want the world to
       know it,<br>
      <li>If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands!
</ul>
     If you don't know lullabies or rhymes for babies, make up
     your own!
<br><br>
 <li>Dance with your baby. To soothe her when she's upset, put
     her head on your shoulder and hum softly or listen to
     recorded music as you glide around the room. To amuse her
     when she's cheerful, try a bouncy tune.
</ul>
     Feeling your touch, hearing your voice, and enjoying the
comfort of physical closeness all help a baby to develop trust.<BR><BR>

<a name="Touch_See"></a>
<H3>Touch and See!</H3>

     Babies are hard at work whenever they are awake, trying to
learn all about the world. To help them learn, they need many
different safe things to play with and inspect. Objects you
have around your home offer many possibilities.
<br><br>

<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>

<ul>
<li>A splinter-free wooden spoon with a face drawn on the bowl
<li>Different textured fabrics, such as velvet, cotton, corduroy,
     terry cloth, satin, burlap, and fake fur 
<li>An empty toilet paper or paper towel roll 
<li>Pots, pans, and lids
<li>An old purse or basket with things to put in and take out
<li>Measuring cups and spoons 
<li>Boxes and plastic containers
<li>Large spools
<li>Noisemakers (rattles, keys, a can filled with beans)
</ul>

<STRONG>What to do</STRONG><br>

<ul>
<li>Put one or two of the items to the left in a safe play
     area where your baby can reach them (more than two may
     confuse him).

<li>Let your baby look at, touch, and listen to a variety of
     objects. Ones that are brightly colored, have interesting
     textures, and make noises are particularly good. Be sure
     that any item you give your baby will be safe in his
     mouth, since that's where it probably will end up.

 <li>Use these items for all age groups. Many of them will
     continue to interest toddlers and older preschoolers. For
     example, babies love to inspect a paper towel roll. But
     with a 4-year-old, it can become a megaphone for talking
     or singing, a telescope, or a tunnel for a toy car.
</ul>

     Babies begin to understand how the world works when they
see, touch, hold, and shake things. Inspecting things also
helps them coordinate and strengthen their hand muscles.<BR><BR>

<H3>What to expect</H3>


     Children this age are
<ul>
  <li>Energetic (walk more steadily, run, push, pull, take
     apart, carry, and climb on and grab things);

   <li>Self-centered; and

  <li>Busy (like to flip light switches, pour things in and out
     of containers, unwrap packages, and empty drawers).
</ul>
     Between their first and second birthdays, they
<ul>
   <li>Like to imitate the sounds and actions of others (by
     pretending to do housework or yardwork, for example);

 <li>Want to be independent and do it themselves (and express
     this by saying "No!");

  <li>Can be clingy;

  <li>Can have relatively short attention spans if not involved
     in an activity;

  <li>Add variations to their physical skills (by walking
     backwards or sideways, for example);

  <li>Begin to see how they are like and unlike other children;

 <li>Become more sensitive to the moods of others;

 <li>Play alone or alongside other toddlers; and

 <li>Increase their vocabularies from about 2 or 3 words to
     about 250 words and understand more of what people say to
     them.
</ul>

<STRONG>What they need</STRONG>

<br><br>
Children this age require
<ul>
    <li>A safe environment for exploring;

    <li>Opportunities to make their own choices ("Do you want the
     red cup or the blue one?");

    <li>Clear and reasonable limits;

    <li>Opportunities to use big muscles (in the arms and legs,
     for example);

    <li>Opportunities to manipulate small objects, such as puzzles
     and stackable toys;

    <li>Activities that allow them to touch, taste, smell, hear,
     and see new things;

    <li>Chances to learn about "cause and effect"--that things
     they do produce certain results (when a stack of blocks
     gets too high it will fall over);

    <li>Opportunities to develop and practice their language 
     skills; and

<H3>Shop till You Drop</H3>

     Shopping is just one of many routines that can help your
child learn. lt's especially good for teaching new words and
introducing preschoolers to new people and places.
<br><br>

<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>

<ul>
<li>A short shopping list
</ul>

     Shopping is one of many ways to surround children with
meaningful talk. They need to hear a lot of words in order to
learn to communicate themselves. It's particularly helpful when
you talk about the "here and now"--things that are going on in
front of your child.

<br><br>     
<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
   <li>Pick a time when neither you nor your child is hungry or
     tired.

   <li>At the grocery store, put your child in the grocery cart
     so that he faces you. Take your time as you walk up and
     down the aisles.

   <li>Talk about what you are seeing and doing: "First, we're
     going to buy some cereal. See, it's in a big red and blue
     box. Listen to the great noise it makes when I shake the
     box. Can you shake the box? Now we're going to pay for the
     groceries. We'll put them on the counter while I get out
     the money. The cashier will tell us how much we have to
     pay."

   <li>Let your child feel the items you buy--a cold carton of
     milk, for example, or the skin of an orange. Talk to your
     child about the items. "The skin of the orange is rough
     and bumpy. Can Rochelle feel the skin?"

   <li>Be sure to name objects you see on a shopping trip.

   <li>Let your child touch a soft sweater or try on a hat or a
     mitten. Find a mirror so he can see himself. Talk as you
     go. "Feel how soft the sweater is. Who's that in the
     mirror? Is that Andre?"

  <li>Let your child practice his "hi's" and "bye-byes" on
     clerks and other shoppers on your outings.

   <li>Keep talking, keep moving, and let your child "help." "In
     this store we need to buy some buttons. You can hold the
     cloth next to the buttons so I can find the right color."
     Putting your toddler's hands in the right position can
     help him learn to understand your directions.

   <li>Leave for home before your child gets grumpy.

<a name="Puppet_Magic"></a>
<H3>Puppet Magic</H3>

     Puppets can be fascinating. Children know that puppets are
not alive. And yet, they move and talk like real living things.
Try making one at home.

<br><br>
<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>
<ul>
 <li>An old clean sock
 <li>Buttons (larger than 1 inch in diameter to prevent swallowing)
 <li>Needle and thread 
 <li>Red fabric 
 <li>Ribbon
 <li>An old glove 
 <li>Felt-tipped pens 
 <li>Nontoxic glue 
 <li>Yarn
</ul>

<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>          
   <li>Sock puppet. Use an old clean sock. Sew on buttons for
     eyes and nose. Paste or sew on a piece of red fabric for
     the mouth. Put a bow made from ribbon at the neck.

   <li>Finger puppets. Cut the ends off the fingers of an old
     glove. Draw faces on the fingers with felttipped pens.
     Glue yarn on for hair.

   <li>Have the puppet talk to your child. "Hello. My name is
     Tanya. What a great T-shirt you have on! I like the rabbit
     on the front of your T-shirt." Or have the puppet sing a
     simple song. Change your voice when the puppet talks or
     sings.

  <li>Encourage your child to speak to the puppet.

   <li>Put finger puppets on your child to give him practice
     moving his fingers one at a time.

   <li>The next time you want help cleaning up, have the puppet
     make the request: "Hello, Maria. Let's put these crayons
     back in the box and these toys back on the shelves. Can
     you get me the ball?"
</ul>

     Puppets provide another opportunity to talk to children
and encourage them to speak. They also help children learn new
words, use their imaginations, and develop their hand and
finger coordination. Children will make many mistakes when they
learn to talk. Instead of correcting them directly, reply by
using the right grammar. For example, if your child says,
"Michael done it," reply, "Yes, David, Michael did it." Speak
slowly and clearly so that your child can imitate your speech.
Use full, but short sentences, and avoid baby talk.<BR><BR>

Moving On
</H3>

     Toddlers love to explore spaces and climb over, through,
and into things.
<br><br>

<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>

<ul>
 <li>Stuffed animal or toy
 <li>Large cardboard boxes
 <li>Pillows
 <li>A large sheet
 <li>A soft ball
 <li>A large plastic laundry basket
 <li>Elastic
 <li>Bells
</ul>

<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
   <li>Pillow jump. Give your toddler some pillows to jump into.
     Toddlers usually figure out how to do this one on their
     own!

   <li>Box car. Give your toddler a large box to push around the
     room. He may want to take his stuffed animal or toy for a
     ride in it. If the box isn't too high--you'll most likely
     find your toddler in there, too!

   <li>Basketball. Sit about 3 feet away from your toddler and
     hold out a large plastic laundry basket. Let him try
     throwing a ball into the basket.

   <li>Table tent. Cover a table with a sheet that's big enough
     to reach the ground on all sides. This makes a great
     playhouse that's particularly good for a rainy day. Watch
     out for bumped heads!

   <li>Jingle bells. Sew bells onto elastic that will fit
     comfortably around your child's ankles. Then watch (and
     listen to) the fun while he moves about or jumps up and
     down.
</ul>

     These skills help children gain control over their large
muscles. They also help children learn important concepts such
as up, down, inside, outside, over, and under.<BR><BR>

<H3>Read to Me!</H3>

     The single most important way for children to develop the
knowledge they need to succeed in reading is for you to read
aloud to them--beginning early.

<br><br>
<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>

<ul>
 <li>Good books
 <li>A children's dictionary (preferably a sturdy one) 
 <li>Paper, pencils, crayons, markers
</ul>



<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
  <li>Read aloud to your child every day. From birth to 6 months
     your baby probably won't understand what you're reading,
     but that's okay. You can get her used to the sound of your
     voice and used to seeing and touching books.

   <li>To start out, use board books with no words or just a few
     words. Point to the colors and the pictures and say their
     names. Simple books can teach children things that will
     later help them learn to read. For example, they learn
     about the structure of language--that there are spaces
     between the words and that the print goes from left to
     right.

   <li>Tell stories. Encourage your child to ask questions and
     talk about the story. Ask her to predict what will come
     next. Point to things in books that she can relate to in
     her own life: "Look at the picture of the penguin. Do you
     remember the penguin we saw at the zoo?"

   <li>Look for reading programs. If you aren't a good reader,
     programs in your community like Even Start can provide
     opportunities for you to improve your own reading and to
     read with your child. Friends and relatives can also read
     to your child, and senior citizen volunteers are available
     in many communities to do the same.

  <li>Buy a children's dictionary--if possible, one that has
     pictures next to the words. Then start the "let's look it
     up" habit.

  <li>Make writing materials available.

   <li>Watch educational TV. Programs such as "Sesame Street" and
     "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" help your child learn the
     alphabet and the sounds they represent.

   <li>Visit the library often. Begin making weekly trips to the
     library when your child is very young. See that your child
     gets a library card as soon as possible. Many libraries
     issue cards to children as soon as they can print their
     names (you'll have to countersign for them).

   <li>Read yourself. What you do sets an example for your child.
</ul>

     The ability to read and understand makes for better
students and leads to better job opportunities and a lifetime
of enjoyment.<BR><BR>

<a name="Music_Makers"></a>
<H3>Music Makers</H3>

     Music is a way to communicate that all children
understand. It's not necessary for them to follow the words to
a song. It makes them happy just to hear the comfort in your
voice or on the recording or to dance to a peppy tune.
<br><br>

<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>

<ul>
 <li>Your voice 
 <li>Music
 <li>Music makers (rattles, a can filled with beans or buttons,
     empty toilet paper rolls, pots, pans, plastic bowls)
</ul>


<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
  <li>Sing a lullaby to a cranky infant.

  <li>As children approach their first birthdays, they begin to
     like making music themselves. Have them try banging a
     wooden spoon on pots, pans, or plastic bowls; shaking a
     large rattle or shaking a plastic container filled with
     beans, buttons, or other noisy items (make sure the
     container is securely closed); and blowing through empty
     toilet paper rolls.

  <li>As toddlers pass their first birthdays, they can actively
     participate in nursery rhymes, even if they can't recite
     the words. They can imitate hand movements, clap, or hum
     along.

   <li>As preschoolers become more physically coordinated,
     encourage them to move to the music. They can twirl, spin,
     jump up and down, tiptoe, or sway.

   <li>Here are some tips for getting young children to sing:
<ul>
   <li>Sing yourself. Sing fairly slowly so children join in and
     enjoy themselves. Discourage shouting. 

    <li>Start with simple chanting. Pick a simple melody, such as
     "Mary Had a Little Lamb," and sing "la, la, la." Add the
     words later.
</ul>
</ul>
     Introduce music to your children early. Listening to you
sing will help them learn to make their voices go up and
down--even if you can't carry a tune! Music and dance teach
preschoolers to listen, to coordinate hand and finger
movements, and to express themselves creatively.<BR><BR>

<a name="Play_Dough"></a>
<H3>Play Dough</H3>

     Young children love to play with dough. And no wonder!
They can squish and pound it and form it into fascinating
shapes. Here's a recipe to make at home.
<br><br>

<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>

<ul>
 <li>2 cups flour 
 <li>1 cup salt 
 <li>4 teaspoons cream of tartar 
 <li>2 cups water
 <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil 
 <li>Food coloring
 <li>Food extracts (almond, vanilla, lemon, or peppermint)
 <li>1 medium saucepan 
 <li>Things to stick in the dough (popsicle sticks, straws)
 <li>Things to pound with (like a toy mallet) 
 <li>Things to make impressions with (jar lids, cookie cutters,
     or bottle caps)
</ul>

<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
   <li>Add the food coloring to the water. Then mix all of the
     ingredients together in a pan.

   <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring until it forms a soft
     ball.

   <li>Let the mixture cool. Knead slightly. Add food extracts to
     different chunks of the dough if you want different
     smells.

   <li>Give some to your toddler or preschooler, so he can pound
     it, stick things in it, make impressions in it, and create
     all kinds of things.
</ul>

     Play dough is a great way to develop hand muscles and be
creative. And cooking together, with all the measuring, is the
perfect way to begin learning mathematics. Letting your child
handle some dough while it is still slightly warm and some when
it has cooled off is a terrific way to teach him about
temperatures. Play dough can be made ahead of time and stored
in an air-tight bag or container.<BR><BR>

<H3>What to expect</H3>

     Children this age
<ul>
    <li>Start to play with other children, instead of next to
     them;

    <li>Are more likely to take turns and share;

    <li>Are friendly and giving;

    <li>Begin to understand that other people have feelings and
     rights;

   <li>Like silly humor, riddles, and practical jokes;

    <li>Like to please and to conform;

    <li>Generally become more cooperative and enjoy new
     experiences;

    <li>Are increasingly self-reliant and probably can dress
     without help (except for buttons and shoelaces);

   <li>May develop fears ("Mommy, there's a monster under my
     bed.") and have imaginary companions,

   <li>Are more graceful physically than 2-year-olds and love to
     run, skip, jump with both feet, catch a ball, climb
     downstairs, and dance to music;

    <li>Are great talkers, speak in sentences, and continue to add
     more words to their vocabularies; and

    <li>Have greater control over hand and arm muscles, which is
     reflected in their drawings and scribblings.
</ul>

<STRONG>What they need</STRONG>

<br><br>
     Children this age require opportunities to
<ul>
   <li>Develop their blooming language abilities through books,
     games, songs, science, and art activities;

    <li>Develop more self-help skills--for example, to dress and
     undress themselves;

    <li>Draw with crayons, work puzzles, build things, and
     pretend;

    <li>Play with other children so they can learn to listen, take
     turns, and share; and

<a name="Kitchen_Cut"></a>
<H3>Kitchen Cut-Ups</H3>

     Here are some recipes popular with preschoolers. Things
always seem to taste better when you make them yourself!

<br><br>
<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>

<ul>
 <li>Knife
 <li>For applewiches: 1 apple, cheese slices
 <li>For funny-face sandwich: 1 piece of bread; peanut butter,
     cream cheese, or egg salad; green pepper, celery,
     radishes, carrot curls; olives; nuts; hard-boiled egg
     slices; tiny shapes of cheese; apples and raisins
 <li>For fruit Popsicles: fruit juice (any kind), an ice cube
     tray or small paper cups, yogurt, mashed or crushed fruit,
     Popsicle sticks
 <li>For bumps on a log: celery, peanut butter, raisins
</ul>


<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
   <li>Choose a safe spot to cook where you won't have to worry
     about making a mess.

   <li>Tell your child what the ingredients are. Talk about what
     you are doing as you go along. Ask and answer questions.

   <li>Let him smell, taste, and touch as you go. Let him (with
     your help) pour, stir, measure, and help clean up.

   <li>Applewiches. Core an apple. Cut the apple crosswise into
     thick slices. Put cheese slices between the slices.
     Cheddar cheese is particularly good. Eat like a sandwich.

  <li>Funny-face sandwich. Cut the bread into a circle. Spread
     with cream cheese, peanut butter, or egg salad. Decorate
     using green pepper, celery, radishes, carrot curls,
     olives, nuts, hard-boiled egg slices, tiny shapes of
     cheese, apples, or raisins for eyes, ears, nose, and
     mouth.

   <li>Fruit Popsicles. Pour the fruit juice into small paper
     cups or an ice cube tray. Place a Popsicle stick in each
     cup or compartment before the juice is completely frozen.
     Return to the freezer until frozen solid. For variations,
     mix yogurt with the juice before freezing for a creamier
     Popsicle, or add mashed or crushed fruit such as
     strawberries, pineapple, or banana.

   <li>Bumps on a log. Spread peanut butter on the celery stalks.
     Decorate with raisins. Great snacks!
</ul>

     Cooking helps children learn new words, measuring and
number skills, what foods are healthy and what ones aren't, and
the importance of completing what they begin. It also teaches
about how things change, and it can teach children to reason
better. ("If I want a cold fruit juice Popsicle, then I'll have
to put it in the freezer.")<BR><BR>

<a name="Scribble"></a>
<H3>Scribble, Paint, and Paste</H3>

     Young children are natural artists. Here are some
activities that introduce preschoolers to scribbling, painting,
and pasting.

<br><br>
<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>

<ul>
 <li>For scribbling: crayons, water-soluble felt-tipped markers,
     different kinds of paper (including construction
     paper, butcher paper), and tape

 <li>For fingerpainting: storebought fingerpaint or homemade
     fingerpaint made with soap flakes, water, food coloring or
     powdered tempera; an eggbeater or fork; a bowl; a spoon;
     an apron or smock; newspapers or a large piece of plastic
     to cover the floor or table; butcher paper; and tape

 <li>For collages: paper, paste, blunt-tipped scissors, fabric scraps
     or objects that can be glued to paper (string, cottonballs,
     sticks, yarn)
</ul>

<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
  <li>Scribbling. Give your child different kinds of paper and
     different writing materials to scribble with. Coloring
     books are not needed. Fat crayons are good to begin with.
     Water-soluble felt-tipped marking pens are fun because
     your child doesn't have to use much pressure to get a
     bright color. Tape a large piece of butcher paper onto a
     table top and let your preschooler scribble to her heart's
     content!

   <li>Fingerpainting. Use store-bought fingerpaint, or make your
     own by mixing soap flakes (not detergent) in a bowl with a
     small amount of water. Beat the mixture with a fork or
     eggbeater. Add powdered tempera paint or food coloring.
     Spread out newspapers or a large piece of plastic over a
     table or on the floor and tape a big piece of construction
     paper or butcher paper on top. Cover your child with a
     large smock or apron, and let her fingerpaint.

   <li>Collages. Have your child paste fabric scraps or other
     objects such as yarn, string, or cottonballs to the paper
     (in any pattern). Let her feel the different textures and
     tell you about them.
</ul>

     Here are a few tips about introducing your preschoolers to
art:
<ul>
    <li>Supervise carefully. Some children would rather color your
     walls than the paper. Some also like to chew on crayons
     and markers or try to drink the paint.

    <li>Don't tell them what to draw or paint.

    <li>Don't fix up their pictures. It will take lots of practice
     before you can recognize their pictures--and that often
     doesn't happen until after they are in kindergarten.

    <li>Give them lots of different materials to work with.
     Parents can demonstrate new types of art materials.

    <li>Find an art activity that's at the right level for your
     child, then let him do as much of the project as possible.

    <li>Ask your preschooler to talk about his picture.

    <li>Display your child's art prominently in your home.
</ul>

     Art projects can spark young imaginations and help
children to express themselves. These projects also help
children to develop the eye and hand coordination they will
later need to learn to write.<BR><BR>

<a name="Chores"></a>
<H3>Chores</H3>

     Any household task can become a good learning game and can
be fun.

<br><br>
<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>

<br><br>
Jobs around the home that need to get done, such as:
<ul>
      <li>Doing the laundry
      <li>Washing and drying dishes
      <li>Carrying out the garbage
      <li>Setting the dinner table
      <li>Dusting
</ul>

<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
   <li>Tell your child about the job you will do together.
     Explain why the family needs the job done. Describe how
     you will do it and how your child can help.

   <li>Teach your child new words that belong to each job. "Let's
     put the placemats on the table, along with the napkins."

   <li>Doing laundry together provides many opportunities to
     learn. Ask your child to help you remember all the clothes
     that need to be washed. See how many things he can name.
     Socks? Tshirts? Pajamas? Have him help you gather all the
     dirty clothes. Have your child help you make piles of
     light and dark colors.
</ul>

     Show your child how to measure out the soap, and have him
     pour the soap into the machine. Let him put the items into
     the machine, naming them. Keep out one sock. When the
     washer is filled with water, take out a sock. Let your
     child hold the wet sock and the one you kept out. Ask him
     which one feels heavier and which one feels lighter. After
     the wash is done, have your child sort his own things into
     piles that are the same (for example, T-shirts, socks).
<br><br>
     Home chores can help children learn new words, how to
listen and follow directions, how to count, and how to sort.
Chores can also help children improve their physical
coordination and learn responsibility.<BR><BR>

     Children this age
<ul>
    <li>Are active and have lots of energy;  

   <li>May be aggressive in their play;

    <li>Can show extremes from being loud and adventurous to
     acting shy and dependent;

    <li>Enjoy more group activities because they have longer
     attention spans;

    <li>Like making faces and being silly;

    <li>May form cliques with friends and can be bossy;

<a name="Hands_on_math"></a>
<H3>"Hands-on" Math</H3>

     Real-life, hands-on activities are the best way to
introduce your preschooler to mathematics!
<br><br>

<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>
<br><br>

Optional:
<ul>
      <li>Blocks
      <li>Dice or dominoes
</ul>

<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
   <li>Talk a lot about numbers and use number concepts in daily
     routines with your preschooler. For example:
<ul>
    <li>Cooking. "Let's divide the cookie dough into two parts so
     we can bake some now and put the rest into the freezer."

    <li>Home projects. "We're going to hang this picture 6 inches
     above the bookshelf in your room."

    <li>Home chores. "How many plates do we need on the table? One
     for Mommy, one for Daddy, and one for Jenny."
</ul>

     It's best not to use drills or arithmetic worksheets with
young children. These can make children dislike math because
they don't fit with the way they learn math naturally.

   <li>Talk about numbers that matter most to your
     preschooler--her age, her address, her phone number, her
     height and weight. Focusing on these personal numbers
     helps your child learn many important math concepts,
     including:
<ul>
   <li>Time (hours, days, months, years; older, younger;
     yesterday, today, tomorrow). To a young child, you might
     say, "At 2 o'clock we will take a nap." When you plan with
     an older preschooler (4 or 5 years old), you could point
     out, "It's only 3 days until we go to Grandma's house.
     Let's put an X on the calendar so we'll know the day we're
     going."

    <li>Lengths (inches, feet; longer, taller, shorter). "this
     ribbon is too short to go around the present for Aunt
     Susan. Let's cut a longer ribbon."

    <li>Weight (ounces, pounds, grams; heavier, lighter; how to
     use scales). "You already weigh 30 pounds. I can hardly
     lift such a big girl." 

    <li>Where you live (addresses, telephone numbers). "These
     shiny numbers on our apartment door are 2-1-4. We live in
     apartment number 214." Or "When you go to play at Terry's
     house, take this note along with you. It's our phone
     number: 253-6711. Some day soon you will know our phone
     number so you can call me when you are at your friend's."
</ul>
   <li>Provide opportunities for your child to learn math. For
     example:
<ul>
   <li>Blocks can teach children to classify objects by color and
     shape. Blocks can also help youngsters learn about depth,
     width, height, and length.

    <li>Games that have scoring, such as throwing balls into a
     basket, require children to count. Introduce games such as
     dominoes or rolling dice. Have your child roll the dice
     and count the dots. Let her try to roll for matches. Count
     favorite toys.

    <li> Books often have number themes or ideas.<BR><BR>

<a name="Getting_Along"></a>
<H3>Getting Along</H3>

     Learning to get along with others is very important.
Children who are kind, helpful, patient, and loving generally
do better in school.

<br><br>
<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>
<br><br>

No materials required

<br><br>

<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
 <li>Let your child know that you are glad to be his mommy or
     daddy. Give him personal attention and encouragement. Set
     aside time when you and your child can do fun things
     together. Your happy feelings toward your child will help
     him feel good about himself.

   <li>Set a good example. Show your preschooler what it means to
     get along with others and to be respectful. Say "please"
     and "thank you." Treat people in ways that show you care
     what happens to them. Ask for things in a friendly way. Be
     kind to and patient with other people.

   <li>Help your child find ways to solve conflicts with others.
     Help your child figure out what will happen if he tries to
     settle his mad feelings by hitting a playmate: "James, I
     know that Tiffany took your toy truck. But if you hit
     Tiffany and you have a big fight, then Tiffany will have
     to go home, and the two of you won't be able to play any
     more today. What is another way that you can let Tiffany
     know you want your truck back?"
<br>
     James might decide to tell Tiffany that he's mad, and that
     he wants his truck back. Or he might let Tiffany play with
     his truck for 5 minutes with the hope that Tiffany will
     then give it back. Listening to your children's problems
     will often be all that is needed for them to solve their
     own problems.

  <li>Make opportunities to share and to care. Let your child
     take charge of providing food for hungry birds. When a new
     family moves into the neighborhood, let your preschooler
     help make cookies to welcome them.

  <li>Be physically affectionate. Children need hugs, kisses, an
     arm over the shoulder, and a pat on the back.

  <li>Tell your child that you love him. Don't assume that your
     loving actions will speak for themselves (although those
     are very important). Teach your child the international
     hand sign for "I love you." You can "sign" each other love
     as your child leaves home for the first day of
     kindergarten.

</ul>

     Children need good social skills. Teachers and other
children will enjoy your youngster's company if he gets along
well with others.<BR><BR>

<H3>My Book</H3>

     Most 4-year-olds like to talk and have a lot to say. They
generally can't write down words themselves, but they enjoy
dictating a story to you.

<br><br>
<STRONG>What you'll need</STRONG>

<ul>
 <li>Paper
 <li>A paper punch
 <li>Blunt-tipped scissors
 <li>Pencil, pen, crayons
 <li>Yarn, pipe cleaners, or staples
 <li>Paste
</ul>

<STRONG>What to do</STRONG>

<ul>
   <li>Make a booklet of five or six pages. Your child can help
     punch holes close to one edge and thread yarn through the
     holes to keep the pages together. You can also bind the
     book with twisted pipe cleaners, or staple the pages
     together.

   <li>On the outside cover, write your child's name. Explain to
     him that this is going to be a book about him.

   <li>Let your child decide what will go on each page. Write it
     down. Examples: Other people in my family. My favorite
     toys. My favorite books. My friends. My pet. My
     neighborhood. My home (or my bedroom). My own drawings.
</ul>

     Making this book will help your child develop his language
skills and give him more practice using the small muscles in
his hands. Your 4-year-old will also love having your undivided
attention.<BR><BR>

</ul>

     Some schools will send you this information. Or they may
hold an orientation meeting in the spring for parents who
expect to enroll their children in kindergarten the following
fall. If they don't, you can call the principal's office to ask
or to arrange a visit.
 <br><br>
     Find out in advance what the school expects from entering
kindergarten students. If you know a year or two ahead of
time, you will be in a better position to prepare your child.
Sometimes parents and caregivers don't think the expectations
are right for their children. If that is the case, you may want
to meet with the principal or kindergarten teachers to talk
about the expectations and ways to change the kindergarten
program.

 <br><br>

     Visit the school with your child so your child can become
familiar with it, and it won't seem scary. Walk up and down the
hallways to learn where things are. Observe the other children
and the classrooms.
 <br><br>
     Talk with your child about school. During your visit, make
positive comments about the school--your good attitude will rub
off! ("Look at all the boys and girls painting in this
classroom. Doesn't that look like fun!") Tell your child about
what the children do when classes begin.
 <br><br>
     Talk about the teachers, and how they will help your child
learn new things. Encourage your child to look at the teacher
as a wise friend toward whom children should be courteous.
Explain to your child how important it is to go to class each
day.
 <br><br>
     If possible, consider volunteering to help out in the
school. The staff may appreciate having an extra adult to help
do everything from passing out paper and pencils in the
classrooms to supervising on the playground. Volunteering is a
good way to learn more about the school and to meet its staff
and other parents.
 <br><br>
     When the long-awaited first day of kindergarten arrives,
go to school with your child (but don't stay too long). And be
patient. Many young children are overwhelmed at first because
they haven't had much experience in dealing with new
situations. They may not immediately like school. Your child
may cry or cling to you when you say goodbye each morning, but
with support from you and the kindergarten teacher, this can
rapidly change.

 <br><br>

     As your child proceeds through school, you will need to
continue your encouragement and involvement. But for now,
celebrate all that you have accomplished as a parent. Share
your children's enthusiasm. Let them know how proud you are as
they leave home for their first day of kindergarten. Let them
know you believe they will succeed.<BR><BR>

<H3>Good Television Habits</H3>

     Children in the United States have watched an average of
4,000 hours of television by the time they begin school. Most
experts agree that this is too much. But banning television
isn't the answer, because good television can spark curiosity
and open up new worlds to children. Monitoring how much and
what television children watch helps them, starting at an early
age, to develop good viewing habits.
 <br><br>
     Too much television can be harmful because
<ul>
  <li>It can expose children to too much sex and violence;

   <li>Children can be unduly influenced by junkfood and toy
     commercials;

   <li>It can give children a poor model for good behavior before
     they have developed a clear idea of right and wrong;

   <li>Young children do not have the experience and wisdom to
     understand complicated plots or scary scenes; and
    
  <li>Sitting passively in front of the set for extended periods
     of time can slow young children's social and intellectual
     development.
</ul>

     Here are some tips to help children develop good
television-viewing habits.
 <br><br>
     Keep a record of how many hours of TV your children watch,
and what they watch. Generally, it's good to limit the amount
to 2 hours or less a day, although you can make exceptions for
special programs.
 <br><br>
     Learn about current TV programs and videos and select good
ones. As parents, you know your children best. So, select TV
programs and videos that are meaningful to your family. Some TV
programs you may wish to consider include "Captain Kangaroo,"
Eureeka's Castle," "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood," Sesame Street,"
and "Shining Time Station." Many other good children's
programs, such as Disney and Nickelodeon, are on public
television stations and on cable channels.
 <br><br>
     If you have a VCR, you may wish to seek out videos made by
Linda Ellerbee's Lucky Duck Productions. Of course, videos vary
in quality, but versions of classic children's books, such as
Babar or Snow White, are a good place to start.
 <br><br>
     Parents who would like help in finding good TV programs
for children can subscribe to Parents' Choice, a quarterly
review of children's media which includes television programs
and home video materials. Write to Parents' Choice Foundation,
Box 185, Newton, MA 02168. A subscription is $18 a year. A
sample copy is $2.
 <br><br>
     You can also read about programs in TV columns in
newspapers and magazines. Cable subscribers and public
broadcasting contributors can check monthly program guides for
information.
 <br><br>
     Plan with your children (starting at age 3) what programs
to watch. After selecting programs appropriate for your
children, help them decide which ones to watch. Turn the TV on
when these shows start, and turn the set off when they are
over.
 <br><br>
     Watch television with your children so you can answer
questions and talk about what they see. Pay special attention
to how they respond so you can help them understand what
they're seeing, if that's needed.
 <br><br>
     Follow-up TV viewing with activities or games. You might
have your child tell you a new word he learned on television
that you can look up together in the dictionary. Or you might
have him make up his own story about one of his favorite TV
characters.
 <br><br>
     Include the whole family in discussion and activities or
games that relate to television programs. Older siblings,
aunts, uncles, and grandparents can all contribute.
 <br><br>
     Make certain that television isn't regularly used as a
babysitter. Instead, try to balance good television with other
fun activities for your child.<BR><BR>

<H3>Choosing Child Care</H3>


     More and more children are in preschool or other child
care settings before they enter kindergarten. Choosing the
right child care is important because it can affect how
prepared your child is for school. Some tips to guide you:
 <br><br>
     Think about the kind of care you want for your child.
Possibilities include (a) a relative; (b) a family day care
provider, usually a woman who takes care of a small group of
children in her home; (c) a child care center; and (d) a
caregiver who comes into your home.
 <br><br>
     Figure out what suits your budget and what you can expect
to spend in your community. For low-income parents, the
federally funded Head Start program (and in some communities
Chapter 1 programs) are available. State-subsidized child care
programs also are available, although most often more people
need the subsidized care than there are spaces available. Many
families are entitled to the child care credit on their income
tax forms.
 <br><br>
     Recognize that there are many ways to find good care. Ask
friends and neighbors. Look in the Yellow Pages of your
telephone book under "Child Care Centers." Look in the
classified ads of your local newspaper, or place an ad of your
own. Put up notices on your church or synagogue bulletin board,
in grocery stores, local community centers, or at the
employment office of local colleges or universities. Look for
notices that other people have put up.
 <br><br>
     If you are looking for a family day care provider, a local
licensing agency can provide you with local listings. Many
communities have resource and referral agencies that help
parents identify the options that best meet their needs.
 <br><br>
     Start looking early, particularly if you have a special
program for your child in mind. Some programs have long waiting
lists. Some may even require you to get on a waiting list
before your child is born.
 <br><br>
     Gather information. If you are looking for a family day
care provider or for a person to come into your home, interview
the person at length and check references. Before you meet with
them, develop a list of questions. If you are looking at day
care centers, visit them--more than once, if possible. Just
because a person or a program worked for someone else doesn't
mean it's right for you. With any kind of child care, check
references.
 <br><br>
     No matter what kind of child care you are considering,
look for caregivers who 
<ul>
  <li>Are kind and responsive. Good caregivers are affectionate,
     enjoy children, are energetic enough to keep up with your
     preschooler, patient, and mature enough to handle crises
     and conflicts.

   <li>Have experience with preschoolers and like them. Find out
     how long they have worked with preschoolers, why they are
     in the early child care field, and whether they provide
     activities that are appropriate for your child's age.
     Observe the caregivers with children. Do the children seem
     happy? How do the caregivers respond to them?

  <li>Recognize the individual needs of your child. Look for
     caregivers who are considerate of different children's
     interests and needs and who can provide your child with
     enough attention.

   <li>Share a child-rearing philosophy that is similar to yours.
     Find out what kind of discipline is used and how problems
     are handled.
</ul>

     Be certain that the child care facility is clean and safe
and is filled with things to explore that are appropriate for
your child's age.<BR><BR>

<a name="School_Checklist"></a>
<H3>Ready-for-School Checklist</H3>


     This checklist, although not exhaustive, can help to guide
you in preparing your child for school. It's best to look at
the items included as goals toward which to aim. They should be
done, as much as possible, through everyday life or by fun
activities you've planned with your child. If your child lags
behind in some areas, don't worry. Remember that all children
are unique. They grow and develop at different rates--and no
one thing guarantees that a child is ready for school.

<P>    Use this checklist to inspect your local school or community
playground. If you mark any items with an "X," ask the proper
school or park official to correct these hazards
immediately-before injuries occur.</P>

<blockquote>
 
 

<p>[  ] <B>Protective Surfacing</B> - The surfaces under and around play
     equipment should be soft enough to cushion falls. For most
     play equipment, these surfaces should contain a minimum of
     12 inches of wood chips, mulch, sand or pea gravel. </p>

<p>[  ]  <B>Fall Zones</B> - To cushion a fall, the shock absorbing material
     should extend a minimum of 6 feet in all directions from
     stationary pieces of play equipment. In front of and behind
     swings, the material should extend a distance equal to twice
     the height of the suspending bar.</p>
     
<p>[  ] <B> Equipment Spacing</B> - Play structures should be spaced at
     least 12 feet apart to allow children space to circulate or
     fall without striking another structure. Moving pieces of
     equipment should be located in an area away from other play
     structures so children have adequate room to pass from one
     play area to another without being struck by a moving swing
     or by another child exiting from a slide.</p>

<p>[  ]  <B>Catch Points and Protruding Hardware</B> - There should be no
     dangerous pieces of hardware, such as protruding bolt ends
     and narrow gaps in metal connections or open "S" hooks at
     the top and bottom of swings. Exposed hardware can cut
     children, puncture skin, or catch clothing drawstrings,
     which could strangle a child.</p>

<p>[  ]  <B>Openings that can trap</B> - Openings in guardrails, and spaces
     between platforms and between ladder rungs, should measure
     less than 3.5 inches or more than 9 inches. Children can get
     trapped and strangle in openings where they can fit their
     bodies but not their heads through the space.

<p>[  ]  <B>Pinch, Crush, Shearing, and Sharp Hazards</B> - Equipment should
     not have sharp points or edges that could cut skin. Moving
     pieces of equipment, such as suspension bridges, track
     rides, merry-go-rounds or, seesaws, should not have
     accessible moving parts that might crush or pinch a child's
     finger.

<p>[  ]  <B>Tripping Hazards</B> - There should be no exposed concrete
     footings, abrupt changes in surface elevations, tree roots,
     tree stumps, and rocks, which can trip children or adults.</p>

<p>[  ]  <B>Guardrails</B> - Elevated surfaces--such as platforms, ramps,
     and bridgeways--should have guardrails to prevent falls.</p>

<p>[  ]  <B>Routine Maintenance</B> - Find out if your playground has a
     designated official who periodically inspects the play
     equipment for preventive maintenance. This includes:
     replacing missing, broken, or worn-out components; securing
     hardware; checking for deterioration in the wood, metal, or
     plastic materials; maintaining the proper 12-inch depth of
     surfacing material; and cleaning up debris. </p>

<p>[  ] <B> Supervision</B> - The play area should be designed so that
     adults can observe children at play.

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
is alerting consumers and public health officials to steps they can take
to reduce entrapment deaths and injuries associated with pools, spas,
and hot tubs.</P>

<P>     The main hazard from hot tubs and spas is the same as that from pools -
drowning.  Since 1980, CPSC has reports of more than 700 deaths in spas
and hot tubs. About one-third of those were drownings to children under
age five.</P>

<P>     Other hazards include body part entrapment and hair entanglement.</P>

<P>     Since 1980, CPSC knows of 18 incidents, including five deaths,
involving children between the ages of two and 14 who were injured or
died due to body part entrapment involving the drain of a swimming pool,
wading pool, or spa. In addition, last week, a 16-year-old New Jersey
girl drowned when her body was sucked down against a drain on the
bottom of a spa. Her body apparently formed a vacuum seal against
an outlet for circulating water and she was held underwater.</P>

<P>     Under normal conditions, pipes leading from a pool's drain, or into
the pool's pumps, draw water from the pool creating suction. If something 
blocks the pool drain leading into this pipe, the amount of suction will
increase as the pump draws water past the obstruction.  This increased
suction can entrap parts of a person's body, causing the person to be held
underwater. In wading pools, if a child sits on the drain outlet, the
suction can cause disembowelment.</P>

<P>     To reduce the risk of entrapment and drowning, current safety standards
require that each spa have two outlets for each pump, lessening the amount 
of suction at any single outlet.</P>

<P>     Since 1978, CPSC has reports of 49 incidents (including 13 deaths) in 
which people's hair was sucked into the suction fitting of a spa, hot tub, 
or whirlpool, causing the victim's head to be held under water. Hair
entanglement occurs when a bather's hair becomes entangled in a drain
cover as the water and hair are drawn through the drain. CPSC helped
develop a voluntary standard for drain covers that reduce the risk of hair 
entanglement.</P>

<P>     CPSC offers the following safety tips when using a hot tub, spa, or
whirlpool:</P>

<ul>
<li>Always use a locked safety cover when the spa is not in use and keep young
  children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult
  supervision.

<br><br><li>Make sure the spa has the dual drains and drain covers required by current
  safety standards.

<br><br><li>Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it 
is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place
  and not cracked or missing. Check the drain covers yourself throughout
  the year.

<br><br><li>Know where the cut-off switch for your pump is so you can turn it off in an emergency.

<br><br><li>Be aware that consuming alcohol while using a spa could lead to drowning.

<br><br><li>Keep the temperature of the water in the spa at 104 degrees Fahrenheit
  or below.<BR><BR>
  </ul>

<P>HARRISBURG, Fa., June 5 /PRNewswire/ -- Baby bottles emblazoned with soft drink logos are among the latest fad items selling in discount and toy stores across the country. Members of the Pennsylvania Dental Association (PDA) and other health-care professionals are concerned that parents and caregivers will be encouraged to give infants soft drinks in these bottles, increasing the likelihood of baby bottle tooth decay.</P>

<P>Baby bottle tooth decay is a condition that can destroy the teeth of an infant or young child. It is the result of teeth being exposed for long periods of time to liquids containing sugars. Sugars are used by bacteria in the mouth as an energy source. In the process, the bacteria produce acids which lead to cavities over time.</P>

<P>Many sweet liquids cause these problems, including milk, formula and fruit juices. And it's not just what is in a child's bottle that causes decay, but how often and for how long. Giving a child a bottle of sweetened liquid many times a day is not a good thing. Allowing the child to fall asleep with a bottle during naps or at night can also harm the child's teeth.</P>

<P>To help keep baby bottle tooth decay from affecting your child, the FDA encourages parents and other caregivers to follow these tips:</P>
 <UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> After each feeding, wipe the baby's gums with a clean, damp washcloth or gauze pad. Begin brushing the child's teeth when the first tooth appears. Clean and massage gums in areas that remain toothless, and begin flossing when all the baby teeth have come in.<br><br>

<LI> Never allow your child to fall asleep with a bottle containing milk, formula, fruit juice or sweetened liquids. If your child needs a comforter between regular feedings, at night, or during naps, fill a bottle with cool water or give the child a clean pacifier recommended by your dentist or physician. Never give your child a pacifier dipped in any sweet liquid and always avoid filling your child's bottle with liquids such as sugar water and soft drinks.<br><br>

<LI> If your local water supply does not contain fluoride, ask your dentist how your child should get it.<br><br>

<LI> Start dental visits by the child's first birthday. Make visits regularly. If you think your child has dental problems, take the child to the dentist as soon as possible.<br><br>
</UL>

<P>The 6,300 members of the Pennsylvania Dental Association serve the public by providing preventive and comprehensive dental care.</P>

<H3>Foreword</H3>

<BR>

<P>     "Why?"</P>

<P>     This is the question we parents are always trying to
answer. It's good that children ask questions: that's the best
way to learn. All children have two wonderful resources for
learning--imagination and curiosity. As a parent, you can
awaken your children to the joy of learning by encouraging
their imagination and curiosity.</P>

<P>     Helping Your Child Learn Math is one in a series of books
on different education topics intended to help you make the
most of your child's natural curiosity. Teaching and learning
are not mysteries that can only happen in school. They also
happen when parents and children do simple things together.</P>

<P>     For instance, you and your child can: sort socks on
laundry day--sorting is a major function in math and science;
cook a meal together--cooking involves not only math and
science but good health as well; tell and read each other
stories--storytelling is the basis for reading and writing (and
a story about the past is also history); or play a game of
hopscotch together--playing physical games will help your child
learn to count and start on a road to lifelong fitness.</P>

<P>     By doing things together, you will show that learning is
fun and important. You will be encouraging your child to study,
learn, and stay in school.</P>

<P>     All of the books in this series tie in with the National
Education Goals set by the President and the Governors. The
goals state that, by the year 2000: every child will start
school ready to learn; at least 90 percent of all students will
graduate from high school; each American student will leave the
4th, 8th, and 12th grades demonstrating competence in core
subjects; U.S. students will be first in the world in math and
science achievement; every American adult will be literate,
will have the skills necessary to compete in a global economy,
and will be able to exercise the rights and responsibilities of
citizenship; and American schools will be liberated from drugs
and violence so they can focus on learning.</P>

<P>     This book is a way for you to help meet these goals. It
will give you a short rundown on facts, but the biggest part of
the book is made up of simple, fun activities for you and your
child to do together. Your child may even beg you to do them.
At the end of the book is a list of resources, so you can
continue the fun.</P>

<P>     As U.S. Education Secretary Lamar Alexander has said:</P>

<P>     The first teachers are the parents, both by example and
conversation. But don't think of it as teaching. Think of it as
fun.</P>

<P>     So, let's get started. I invite you to find an activity in
this book and try it.</P>

Assistant Secretary and Counselor to the Secretary</P>

<H3>The Basics</H3>


<P>     You may have noticed that we are talking about
"mathematics"--the subject that incorporates numbers, shapes,
patterns, estimation, and measurement, and the concepts that
relate to them. You probably remember studying
"arithmetic"--adding, subtracting, multiplying, and
dividing--when you were in elementary school. Now, children are
starting right away to learn about the broad ideas associated
with math, including problem solving, communicating
mathematically, and reasoning.</P>

<P>     Kindergartners are building bar graphs of birthday cakes
to show which month has the most birthdays for the most
children in the class. Second graders are using pizzas to learn
fractions, and measurements are being taken using items other
than rulers (for example, the illustrator of this book used his
thumb to determine how large the pictures of the pizzas should
be in proportion to the size of the words on the activities
pages).</P>


<P>What Does It Mean To</P>


<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>  Be a Problem Solver,<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>   Communicate Mathematically, and<BR><BR>

	<LI>  Demonstrate Reasoning Ability?<BR><BR>

</UL>

<P>     A problem solver is someone who questions, investigates,
and explores solutions to problems; demonstrates the ability to
stick with a problem for days, if necessary, to find a workable
solution; uses different strategies to arrive at an answer;
considers many different answers as possibilities; and applies
math to everyday situations and uses it successfully.</P>

<P>     To communicate mathematically means to use words or
mathematical symbols to explain real life; to talk about how
you arrived at an answer; to listen to others' ways of thinking
and perhaps alter their thinking; to use pictures to explain
something; to write about math, not just give an answer.</P>

<P>     To demonstrate reasoning ability is to justify and explain
one's thinking about math; to think logically and be able to
explain similarities and differences about things and make
choices based on those differences; and to think about
relationships between things and talk about them.</P>


<H4>How Do I Use this Book?</H4>


<P>     This book is divided into introductory material that
explains the basic principles behind the current approach to
math, sections on activities you can do with your children, and
lists of resources. The activities take place in three
locations: the home, the grocery store, and in transit.</P>

<P>The activities are arranged at increasingly harder levels of
difficulty. Look for the circles, squares, and triangles that
indicate the level of difficulty. The     means that a child in
kindergarten through 1st grade could probably play the game,
the     is for those in grades 2 and 3, and the     signals an
activity for a child in grades 4 through 8.</P>

<P>     The activities you choose and the level of difficulty
really depend on your child's ability if your child seems
ready, you might want to go straight to the most difficult
ones.</P>

 

<P>     The shaded box on an activity page contains the answer
or a simple explanation of the mathematical concept behind the
activity so that you can explain when your child asks, "Why are
we doing this?"</P>

<P>     With these few signs to follow along the way, your math
journey begins.</P>

<H3>Important Things To Know</H3>

<P>     It is highly likely that when you studied math, you were
expected to complete lots of problems accurately and quickly.
There was only one way to arrive at your answers, and it was
believed that the best way to improve math ability was to do
more problems and to do them fast. Today, the focus is less on
the quantity of memorized problems, and more on understanding
the concepts and applying thinking skills to arrive at an
answer.
</P> 

<H4>Wrong Answers Can Help!</H4>


<P>     While accuracy is always important, a wrong answer may
help you and your child discover what your child may not
understand. You might find some of these thoughts helpful when
thinking about wrong answers.</P>

<P>     Above all be patient. All children want to succeed. They
don't want red marks or incorrect answers. They want to be
proud and to make you and the teacher proud. So, the wrong
answer tells you to look further, to ask questions, and to see
what the wrong answer is saying about the child's
understanding.</P>

<P>     Sometimes, the wrong answer to a problem might be because
the child thinks the problem is asking another question. For
example, when children see the problem 4 + ___ = 9, they often
respond with an answer of 13. That is because they think the
problem is asking What is 4+9?", instead of "4 plus what
missing amount equals 9?"</P>

<P>     Ask your child to explain how the problem was solved. The
response might help you discover if your child needs help with
the procedures, the number facts, or the concepts involved.</P>

<P>     You may have learned something the teacher might find
helpful. A short note or call will alert the teacher to
possible ways of helping your child.</P>

<P>     Help your children be risk takers: help them see the value
of examining a wrong answer; assure them that the right answers
will come with proper understanding.</P>


<H4>Problems Can Be Solved Different Ways</H4>


<P>     Through the years, we have learned that while problems in
math may have only one solution, there may be many ways to get
the right answer. When working on math problems with your
child, ask, "Could you tell me how you got that answer?" Your
child's way might be different than yours. If the answer is
correct and the strategy or way of solving it has worked, it is
a great alternative. By encouraging children to talk about what
they are thinking, we help them to become stronger
mathematicians and independent thinkers.</P>


<H4>Doing Math in Your Head Is Important</H4>


<P>     Have you ever noticed that today very few people take
their pencil and paper out to solve problems in the grocery,
fast food, or department store or in the office? Instead, most
people estimate in their heads.</P>

<P>     Calculators and computers demand that people put in the
correct information and that they know if the answers are
reasonable. Usually people look at the answer to determine if
it makes sense, applying the math in their heads to the
problem. This, then, is the reason why doing math in their
heads is so important to our children as they enter the 21st
century.</P>

<P>     You can help your child become a stronger mathematician by
trying some of these ideas to foster mental math skills:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>  Help children do mental math with lots of small numbers in
	     their heads until they develop quick and accurate
	     responses. Questions such as, "If I have 4 cups, and I
	     need 7, how many more do I need?" or "If I need 12 drinks
	     for the class, how many packages of 3 drinks will I need
	     to buy?"<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>  Encourage your child to estimate the answer. When
     estimating, try to use numbers to make it easy to solve
	     problems quickly in your head to determine a reasonable    
	    answer. For example, when figuring 18 plus 29, an easy way
	     to get a "close" answer is to think about 20 + 30, or 50.<BR><BR>

	<LI>  As explained earlier, allow your. children to use
	    strategies that make sense to them.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>  Ask often, "Is your answer reasonable?" Is it reasonable
	    that I added 17 and 35 and got 367? Why? Why not?<BR><BR>
	
</OL>
 

<H4>What Jobs Require Math?</H4>


<P>     All jobs need math in one way or another. From the
simplest thought of how long it will take to get to work to
determining how much weight a bridge can hold, all jobs require
math.</P>

<P>     If you took a survey, you would find that everyone uses
math: the school teacher, the fast food worker, the doctor, the
gas station attendant, the lawyer, the housewife, the painter.</P>

     For example, if the player picks a 5 and a 6, the player
     can choose to cross out 11, or 5 and 6, or 7 and 4, or 8
     and 3, or 9 and 2, or 10 and 1, or 1, 2, and 8.<BR><BR>

 <LI> Make 100. Take out all the cards from the deck except ace
     through 6. Each player draws 8 cards from the deck. Each
     player decides whether to use a card in the tens place or
     the ones place so that the numbers total as close to 100
     as possible without going over. For example, if a player
     draws two 1s (aces), a 2, a 5, two 3s, a 4, and a 6, he
     can choose to use the numerals in the following way:<BR><BR>

     30, 40, 10, 5, 6, 1, 3, 2. This adds up to 97.<BR><BR>

<B>What to do</B>
<OL Type=1 Style="1">
<LI>  How many numbers can we make? Give each player a piece of
     paper and a pencil. Using the cards from 1 (ace)-9, deal 4
     cards out with the numbers showing. Using all four cards
     and a choice of any combination of addition, subtraction,
     multiplication, and division, have each player see how
     many different answers a person can get in 5 minutes.
     Players get one point for each answer. For example,
     suppose the cards drawn are 4, 8, 9, and 2. What numbers
     can be made?<BR><BR>

     4+9+8+2=23<BR>
     4+9-(8+2)=3<BR>
     (8-4)x(9-2)=28<BR>
     (9-8)x(4-2)=2<BR><BR>

<LI>  Make the most of it. This game is played with cards from 1
     (ace) to 9. Each player alternates drawing one card at a
     time, trying to create the largest 5-digit number
     possible. As the cards are drawn, each player puts the
     cards down in their "place" (ten thousands, thousands,
     hundreds, tens, ones) with the numbers showing. One round
     goes until each player has 6 cards. At that point, each
     player chooses one card to throw out to make the largest
     5-digit number possible.<BR><BR>

  <LI> Fraction fun. This game is played with cards 1 (ace)-10,
     and 2 players. Each player receives one-half of the cards.
     Players turn over 2 cards each at the same time. Each
     player tries to make the largest fraction by putting the 2
     cards together. The players compare their fractions to see
     whose is larger. For example, if you are given a 3 and a
     5, the fraction 3/5 would be made; if the other person is
     given a 2 and an 8, the fraction is 2/8. Which is larger?
     The larger fraction takes all cards and play continues
     until one player has all the cards.<BR><BR>

<H2>Mathland: The Grocery Store</H2>
</center>
<BR>

<P>     The grocery store is one of the best examples of a place
where math is real. Since trips to the grocery usually affect
everyone in the family, the following activities include
various levels of difficulty within the activity. Look for the
symbols to determine which parts of the activities are for
which ages:</P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI>     for grades K-1

	<LI>     for grades 2 and 3

	<LI>     for grades 4 through 8.
</UL>

<P>     All of these activities can take place over many visits to
the store.</P>

</UL>

<B>What to do</B>
<OL Type=1 Start="1">
 <LI> Help your child examine the scale. Explain that pounds are
     divided into smaller parts called ounces and 16 ounces
     equal a pound.<BR><BR>

  <LI> Gather the produce you are purchasing, and estimate the
     weight of each item before weighing it.<BR><BR>

 <LI> Use sample questions to foster thinking about measurement
     and estimation. You might Want to ask your child,<BR><BR>

 
     How much do you think 6 apples will weigh? More than a
     pound, less than a pound, equal to a pound? How much do
     the apples really weigh? Do they weigh more or less than
     you predicted? How about the potatoes? Will 6 potatoes
     weigh more or less than the apples? How much do potatoes
     cost per pound? If they cost ___ cents per pound, what is
     the total cost?<BR><BR>

     Some grocery stores have scales that tell all the answers
     to these questions, so in that case, estimate using the
     same procedure to make sure the machines are accurate.<BR><BR>

for weight and foster the ability to compare items when
measuring.</P>

     Parent: Is it more than 50?<BR><BR>

     Child: No.<BR><BR>

     Parent: Is it an even number?<BR><BR>

     Child: No.<BR><BR>

     Parent: Is it more than 20 but less than 40?<BR><BR>

     Child: Yes.<BR><BR>

     Parent: Can you divide this number up into 3 equal parts?<BR><BR>

     And so on ...<BR><BR>

 <LI>After you have guessed your child's number, let your child
     guess a number from you by asking similar questions.
 </OL>
<P>     The questions asked demonstrate many different levels of
math. They can serve as learning tools for explaining concepts.
For example, you can take the opportunity to explain what an
even number is if your child does not know.</P>

<P>     Here are a few ideas that might help you support a
positive math environment in your child's school:</P>
<OL Type=1 Start="1">
  <LI> Visit the school and see if the children:<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Are actively engaged in math;<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>    Are talking about mathematics;<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>    Are working together to solve math problems;<BR><BR>

	<LI>    Have their math work on display;<BR><BR>

	<LI>    Use manipulatives (objects that children can touch and
	    move) in the classroom.<BR><BR>
</UL>

  <LI> Explore the math program with your child's teacher,
     curriculum coordinator, or principal. Here are some
     questions you might ask:<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Are there manipulatives in the classroom?<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>    Are you familiar with the National Council of Teachers of
	      Mathematics standards (see next page)?<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>    How are the standards being used in this school?<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>    What can I do to help foster a strong math program where
	      children can explore math concepts before giving the right
	      answer?<BR><BR>
</UL>

 <LI> If you would like to help out, here are some suggestions
     for parent groups:<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>    Make games for teachers;<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>    Help seek out sponsors who believe in a strong math
	     program for the school and who might provide materials and
	     resources;<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>    Support math classes for families at your school.<BR><BR>
</UL>

  <LI> Keep a positive attitude even if you don't like what you
     see. Work to improve the math curriculum by doing some of
     the things mentioned throughout this book.<BR><BR>

  <LI> Share this book with your child's teacher.<BR><BR>

<center><H3>2) What Should I Expect from a Math Program?</H3></center>

<P>     The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) has
recently endorsed standards by which math should be taught in
the elementary and middle grade years. The powerful nature of
these standards is that they not only have the endorsement of
the academic community, but they are also heavily endorsed by
corporations. These endorsements, together with the
technological advances of our society and the lack of math
confidence in our work force, have combined to produce
tremendous support for the standards.</P>

<P>     These standards make some assumptions about the way math
should be taught and what parents might see when visiting the
classroom. Here are some examples:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>   Children will be engaged in discovering mathematics, not
	      just doing many problems in a book.<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>   Children will have the opportunity to explore,
	      investigate, estimate, question, predict, and test their
	      ideas about math.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>   Children will explore and develop understanding for math
	      concepts using materials they can touch and feel, either
	    natural or manufactured.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>   The teacher will guide the students' learning, not dictate
      how it must be done.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>   Children will have many opportunities to look at math in
	     terms of daily life and to see the connections among math
	      topics such as between geometry and numbers.<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>   Children will be actively involved in using technology
	      (calculators and computers) to solve math problems.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>     The complete list of standards is available from NCTM,
1906 Association Drive, Reston, Virginia 22091-1593
(1-800-235-7566).</P>

<P>     In some of the nation's sunbelt, drowning has been the
leading cause of accidental death in the home of children under 5
years old. The information below can help parents and caregivers
provide young children with the protection they deserve. </P>

<P>     Each year, nationwide, more than 300 children under 5 years
old drown in residential swimming pools, usually a pool owned by
their family. In addition, more than 2,000 children in that age
group are treated in hospital emergency rooms for submersion
injures. </P>

<P>     Medical costs for submersion victims during the initial
hospitalization alone can be quite high. Costs can range from an
estimated $2,000 for a victim who recovers fully to $80,000 for a
victim with severe brain damage. Some severely brain damaged
victims have initial hospital stays in excess of 120 days and
expenses in excess of $150,000. </P>

<P>     Many communities have enacted safety regulations governing
residential swimming pools -- inground and aboveground. It's up
to parents to comply with these regulations. Apart from these
laws, parents who own pools, can take their own precautions to
reduce the chances of their youngsters accessing the family pool
or spa without adult supervision.</P>

<a name="Facts"></a>
<H3>Facts and Figures</H3>

<P>     Following are just a few facts uncovered by the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in a comprehensive
study of drowning and submersion incidents involving children
under 5 years old in Arizona, California, and Florida. </P>

<UL>
<LI>    Seventy-five percent of the submersion victims studied by
CPSC were between I and 3 years old; 65 percent of this group
were boys. Toddlers, in particular, often do something unexpected
because their capabilities change daily. 

<LI>    At the time of the incidents, most victims were being
supervised by one or both parents.  Forty-six percent of the
victims were last seen in the house; 23 percent were last seen in
the yard or on the porch or patio; and 31 percent were in or
around the pool before the accident. In all, 69 percent of the
children were not expected to be at or in the pool, yet they were
found in the water. 

<LI>   Submersion incidents involving children usually happen in
familiar surroundings. Sixty-five percent of the incidents
happened in a pool owned by the child's family and 33 percent o
the incidents happened in a pool owned by friends or relatives. 

<LI>    Pool submersions involving children happen quickly. A child
can drown in the time it takes to answer a phone. Seventy-seven
percent of the victims had been missing from sight for 5 minutes
or less. 

<LI>    Survival depends on rescuing the child quickly and
restarting the breathing process, even while the child is still
in the water. Seconds count in preventing death or brain damage. 

<LI>    Child drowning is a silent death. There's no splashing to
alert anyone that the child is in trouble.

<H3>Barriers</H3>

<P>     The following barrier recommendations are the result of
identifying key parameters that typically contribute to child
drowning in backyard pools. These recommendations are the minimum
steps you can take to make your home a safe place for your child.</P>

<P>     Barriers are not childproof, but they provide layers of
protection for a child who strays from supervision. Barriers give
parents additional time to locate a child before the unexpected
becomes a reality. </P>

<P>     Barriers include a fence or wall, door alarms for the house,
and a power safety cover over the pool. Barriers also may be used
to protect children from accessing hot tubs and spas. Use the
following recommendations as a guide: </P>

<a name="Fences"></a>
<H3>Fences and Gates</H3>

<UL>
<LI>  Install a fence or other barrier, such as a wall, completely
around the pool. If the house is part of the barrier, the doors
leading from the house to the pool should be protected with an
alarm or the pool should have a power safety cover. Alarm and
cover details are below. 

<LI>    The fence or other barrier should be at least 4 feet high.
It should have no foot- or handholds that could help a young
child to climb it. 

<LI>    Vertical fence slats should be less than 4 inches apart to
prevent a child from squeezing through.  


<LI>Use this as a guide when the release mechanism is located less
than 54 inches from the bottom of the gate.

<UL>
<LI>    If horizontal members are equal to or more than 45 inches
apart, vertical spacing shall not exceed 4 inches. 

<LI>    If the fence is chain link, then no part of the
diamond-shaped opening should be larger than 1-3/4 inches. 
</UL>

<LI>    Fence gates should be self-closing and self-latching. The
gate should be well maintained to close and latch easily. The
latch should be out of a child's reach. 

<LI>    When the release mechanism of the self-latching device is
less than 54 inches from the bottom of the gate, the release
mechanism for the gate should be at least 3 inches below the top
of the gate on the side facing the pool. Placing the release
mechanism at this height prevents a young child from reaching
over the top of a gate and releasing the latch. Also, the gate
and barrier should have no opening greater than 1/2 inch within
18 inches of the latch release mechanism. This prevents a young
child from reaching through the gate and releasing the latch.
</UL>

<P>     There are a wide variety of fencing construction materials
available to compliment your house and pool surroundings. Your
local fence company or pool enclosure company can provide you
with information and assist you in making a selection.</P>

<P>     The weak link in the strongest and highest fence is a gate
that fails to close and latch completely. For a gate to close
completely every time, it must be in proper working order.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Door"></a>
<H3>Door Alarms</H3>

<UL>
<LI>    If the house forms one side of the barrier, then doors
leading from the house to the pool should be protected with
alarms that produce an audible sound when a door is unexpectedly
opened. 

<LI>    Install an alarm that can be temporarily turned off by an
adult for a single opening of the door by using a keypad or
switch that is out of a child's reach.
</UL>

<P>     Battery and electrically powered alarms are available. The
key pad switch can be used by adults who wish to pass through the
door without setting off the alarm. It should be placed high on
all doors leading from the house to the pool. Affordable and
easily installed alarms are available. An alarm signal
immediately tells a parent that a door has been opened. </P>

<hr>

<a name="Power"></a>
<H3>Power Safety Covers</H3>

<UL>
<LI>    Power safety covers over the pool may be used as an
alternative to door alarms. A power safety cover should meet the
requirements of the ASTM pool cover standard which addresses
labeling requirements and performance. ASTM requires that a cover
withstand the weight of two adults and a child to allow a rescue
should an individual fall onto the cover. The standard also 
requires quick removal of water from the cover. A young child can
drown in just inches of water. 
</UL>

<P>     A power safety cover is a motor powered barrier that can be
placed over the water area. Motor-driven covers easily open and
close over the pool. When the power safety cover is properly in
place over the pool, it provides a high level of safety for
children under 5 years old by inhibiting their access to the
water. </P>

<H3>Above-Ground Pools</H3>

<UL>
<LI>    Steps and ladders leading from the ground to the pool should
be secured and locked, or removed when the pool is not in use.
</UL>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Rules"></a>
<H3>Rules For Pools</H3>

<UL>
<LI>      Instruct baby sitters about potential pool hazards to young
children and about the use of protective devices, such as door
alarms and latches. Emphasize the need for constant supervision. 

<LI>      Never leave a child unsupervised near a pool. During social
gatherings at or near a pool, appoint a "designated watcher" to
protect young children from pool accidents. Adults may take turns
being the "watcher." When adults become preoccupied, children are
at risk. 

<LI>      If a child is missing, check the pool first. Seconds count
in preventing death or disability. Go to the edge of the pool and
scan the entire pool, bottom and surface, as well as the pool
area. 

<LI>     Do not allow a young child in the pool without an adult. 

<LI>      Do not consider young children to be drownproof because they
have had swimming lessons. Children must be watched closely while
swimming. 

<LI>      Do not use flotation devices as a substitute for
supervision. 

<LI>      Learn CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Baby sitters and
other caretakers, such as grandparents and older siblings, should
also know CPR. 

<LI>      Keep rescue equipment by the pool. Be sure a telephone is
poolside with emergency numbers posted nearby. 

<LI>      Remove toys from in and around the pool when it is not in
use. Toys can attract young children to the pool. 

<LI>      Never prop open the gate to a pool barrier.

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
voted today (CPSC)(2-1) (with Commissioners Mary Sheila Gall
and Thomas Moore in the majority and Chairman Ann Brown
dissenting) to amend the current children's sleepwear
standard under the Flammable Fabrics Act.  </P>
<P>     The amendments will permit the sale of tight-fitting
children's sleepwear and sleepwear for infants aged nine
months or under, even if the garments do not meet the
flammability standards ordinarily applicable to such
sleepwear. The new amendments will become effective 18
months after the date that they are published in the Federal
Register and the existing stay of enforcement will remain in
effect until that date.</P>
<P>     In commenting on the amendments, Commissioner Moore
said, "As a data-driven agency, we sometimes find that our
data support the relaxation of a consumer protection
regulation without compromising the safety of consumers.
Over the years the CPSC has taken a number of initiatives
that have reduced potential ignition sources in the home.
Those other actions contributed to our ability today to
allow consumers a limited cotton option for children's
sleepwear garments."  </P>
<P>     Commissioner Gall said, "As a commissioner and a
mother, I hope parents will wisely choose the safer
alternative of tight-fitting cotton sleepwear garments made
possible by these amendments, rather than loose-fitting
T-shirts."</P>
<P>     The commission reached its result based on staff
findings that there were virtually no injuries associated
with single-point ignition incidents of tight-fitting
sleepwear, or of sleepwear worn by infants under one year.
The data demonstrating this absence of injury were
buttressed by staff findings that: (1) tight-fitting
sleepwear is less likely to come into contact with a flame;
(2) even when ignited, tight-fitting sleepwear is not apt to
burn readily because it does not trap air that feeds a fire
and the proximity of the skin soaks up heat that would
otherwise cause the fire to spread; and (3) infants under
six months are insufficiently mobile to expose themselves to
sources of fire. </P>
<P>      CPSC used nine months instead of six as the sizing
criteria for infants' sleepwear
because of sizing practices within the clothing industry.
The commission hopes that its action
will enable consumers who prefer cotton sleepwear to choose
safer tight-fitting garments
rather than loose-fitting non-flame retardant clothing, such
as oversize T-shirts.</P>

 <H4>              Statement of the Honorable Mary Sheila Gall <BR>
                    On Vote to Amend the Flammability <BR>
                   Standard For Children's Sleepwear<BR><BR>
                             April 30, 1996<BR>
</H4>
 </center>
<P>     I voted to amend the regulations pertaining to the
flammability of children's sleepwear. The record
conclusively demonstrates that the type of sleepwear that
will be permitted for sale by the amended regulations does
not pose an unreasonable risk of the occurrence of fire
leading to the death or injury of children.  The record
compiled by the staff demonstrates that for many years there
have been no injuries, either in the United States or
Canada, associated with the single point ignition of the
type of children's sleepwear that this amended standard
will permit to be sold.  There are verifiable reasons why
sleepwear permitted by this amended regulation
(tight-fitting cotton garments) is not likely to result in
death or injury from single point ignition fires.  Its fit
close to the body gives it three fire-resistant features:
(1) it is less likely to come into contact with an ignition
source;  (2) less air is available to feed the fire
even if the cloth is ignited;  and (3) the close proximity
of the skin acts as a "heat sink" to retard the spread of
fire.  </P>
<P>     The amended regulation that the Commission adopts today
is very similar to the one set forth in the staff proposal.
There is a slight change;  the new regulation exempts infant
sleepwear garments from the sleepwear flammability
requirements if they contain a label stating that they are
intended for use by infants under nine months.  The staff
recommendation specified six months.  Information that the
Commission received about sizing practices in the infants
clothing industry persuaded me that so many six-month old
children are wearing garments "sized at" nine months that
this change will result in no reduction of safety.</P>
<P>     The Commission received many sincere comments urging us
not to exempt any children's sleepwear garments at all from
the present sleepwear flammability standards. Although I
understand the motives of these commenters, I am convinced
that the amendments that we adopt today will lead to safer
choices for consumers than the loose-fitting non-flame
retardant garments that many consumers now use as children's
sleepwear.  I urge parents to select children's sleepwear
carefully with an eye towards flammability considerations,
and I urge all members of the apparel industry to join with
those members that have agreed to conduct an information and
education campaign to educate consumers about the relative
flammability hazards posed by various sleepwear garments.</P>

                         April 30, 1996<BR></H4>
 </center>
<P>     This has been the toughest decision I have had to make
since coming to the Commission. For me, there is no perfect
solution to the dilemma with which we are faced. There is
reason to believe that increasingly consumers are
circumventing the intent of the sleepwear regulation by
allowing their children to sleep in cotton non-sleepwear
garments, and yet there is no data to indicate the cotton
garments allowed under our stay of enforcement have resulted
in fire deaths or injuries.</P>
<P>     Even so, we still have questions about the sufficiency
and/or meaning of the no-injury data and, therefore,
questions of certainty as to what will be the impact of
further sanctioning  a limited cotton option in the
sleepwear market and thus changing a regulation many feel
has served the nation well for 20 years.  </P>
<P>    If it were legally supportable under the Administrative
Procedure Act and our own statutes, I would have preferred
to keep a string on this amendment to the sleepwear standard
by letting it go into effect for a set number of years and,
toward the end of that time, reviewing the results to see
how those injury statistics compared with the staff's
current projections of what they would be. If, at that time,
the data portended that increased use of cotton sleepwear
garments would have meant significantly increased fire
injury risks to children, the amendment would have been
automatically revoked. There does not seem to be a way to
achieve this without having to go through a full-blown
rulemaking proceeding at the end of the review period.</P>
<P>     The critical issue is, if you cannot control a family's
use of non-complying, cotton products as sleepwear, what is
the best solution for protecting child safety under these
circumstances? I am offering the next best solution. I voted
today to amend the sleepwear standard to allow tight-fitting
garments (as defined in the staff proposal) in sizes larger
than nine months to be made from cotton.  These garments
would still be subject to the flammability requirements of
the general wearing apparel standard but would no longer be
subject to the more stringent sleepwear standard.  </P>
<P>     I also voted to alter the staff proposal to allow
infants' garments sized nine months and smaller to be made
from cotton, without having to meet the tight-fitting
requirements, provided they are clearly labeled to indicate
that the size is nine months or smaller.  This will exclude
sleepwear for infants who are not very mobile and, therefore
not likely to put themselves in the way of an ignition
source, as consumers tend to buy larger sizes for rapidly
growing infants and, most likely, infants wearing  size nine
would be six months or younger.   Our data indicates that
children of this age (indeed, even children up to the age of
one year old) are not the victims of sleepwear ignition
injuries or death.  </P>
<P>     My vote was predicated on certain conditions. The
preamble to this rule must make it clear--and I want to
underscore this point--that the Commission will continue to
carefully and thoroughly monitor the injury statistics
related to sleepwear ignition and if, at any time, we see a
notable resurgence in fire injury risks related to infants'
or children's cotton sleepwear, we will act quickly
to commence a rulemaking to review the advisability of
continuing to allow these garments in the marketplace. And I
have asked the staff to provide this data to the
Commissioners on a frequent, periodic basis so we can watch
this situation very carefully. Also, it is worth reiterating
that if the Commission were to see a particular garment that
is clearly linked with increased fire injuries, the
Commission can and will take appropriate action against that
product.  </P>
<P>     If problems do develop, I want to make sure the
Commission learns of them promptly. To this end, I invite
medical and fire fighting professionals to help us compile
the most accurate data possible about this type of
fire-related hazard. The Commission has received a number of
letters from both types of professionals opposing any change
to the sleepwear standard. Many of the comments were based
on a fear of what might happen, coupled with the knowledge
of how devastating burn injuries can be, rather than on any
concrete data about deaths or injuries from the cotton
underwear and playwear garments which are currently being
used as sleepwear.   </P>
<P>     Based on the scientific information and fire data
presently available, we expect to continue to see a lack of
fire injuries and deaths if tight-fitting cotton sleepwear
is allowed in the market and is used properly.  But I
encourage those most concerned about this regulation from
its safety perspective to be vigilant in helping to monitor
this situation.  I also want them to be reassured that our
action today does not mean that we will fail to follow very
carefully the impact this relaxation in the standard
has on the safety of our nation's children.</P>
<P>     Despite the current sleepwear regulations, we know that
some parents either specifically seek out non-sleepwear
cotton garments for their children to sleep in or allow
their children to sleep in their cotton underwear/daywear
although they may not have originally purchased the garments
for that purpose.  The increase in long underwear sales
since our stay of enforcement is some evidence of this use.
Both the experience under the stay, and to some extent, the
lack of a problem under the more liberal Canadian standard,
lead to the conclusion that we can also relax our standard
without harm.  </P>
<P>     Given the fact the American consumer is already
experimenting in this area and doing it blindly, it behooves
the Commission to at least try to control this situation by
allowing a tight-fitting cotton sleepwear garment on the
market and by giving consumers the information they need to
make an informed choice.</P>
<P>     I believe, with certain safeguards, we can give parents
a limited cotton option, which they seem to want.  However,
I also believe it is critical to remind parents why the
infants' and children's sleepwear standard was promulgated
in the first place.  Some manufacturers I spoke with during
this deliberative process confirmed my own suspicions--
people do not know why they cannot obtain cotton sleepwear
for their children.  The origins of the regulation have
passed from the memory of an older generation and have not
been transmitted to the next.  If parents are to be given a
choice, they need to have the information on which to base
their decision.  </P>
<P>     Certain industry groups, such as the National Cotton
Council and the American Apparel Association, as well as
individual companies, such as Carter's, have given
assurances they will mount an information and education
campaign, with CPSC guidance, which I hope will help
consumers to understand why the cotton sleepwear garments
that are being allowed on the market must fit their children
snugly; why certain types of sleepwear garments will remain
polyester; and, why loose fitting cotton garments should not
be used as sleepwear.  </P>
<P>     I believe it is imperative that a visible point of
purchase label of some type either be on the garment or on
or inside the garment wrapper.  As necessary as information
and education campaigns are, unless they extend across
generations (and neither industry nor the CPSC has that kind
of money), they have a limited life, and once over with,
people will rapidly forget--just as current parents
have--the reason for the limited cotton sleepwear options.
A proper label will continually remind consumers of
the purpose of the regulations.</P>
<P>     In conjunction with reminding the public about the
purpose of the sleepwear regulations, the information and
education campaign should educate retailers as to why it is
important to separate complying sleepwear from noncomplying
underwear and daywear that could be used for sleepwear.  A
commingling of those products dilutes the message we are
trying to send to consumers and makes it more likely that
even the most educated consumer will inadvertently buy a
product other than the one they originally intended to buy:
buying instead a non-sleepwear alternative that is not as
tight-fitting and, therefore not as safe for sleeping, as a
similar complying sleepwear garment.</P>
<P>     In addition, I am encouraged that, at least in the
short-term, a well-designed and broadly disseminated
information and education campaign will assist the
Commission in addressing a problem we uncovered as part of
our review of the fire death and injury statistics, and that
is the problem of children sleeping in loose fitting
non-sleepwear garments, typically t-shirts.  Tragically,
this is where the deaths and injuries are occurring.</P>
<P>     Residential fire deaths and injuries have declined
dramatically over the last twenty years.  And deaths and
injuries from all types of clothing ignition (not just the
sleepwear that is the subject of this rulemaking) have gone
way down.  Since its inception, the Commission has attacked
the nation's fire problem, as it relates to consumer
products, on a number of fronts, including making products
such as portable electric and kerosene heaters safer and
requiring disposable cigarette lighters to be
child-resistant.  Thus, many of the ignition sources that
led to the promulgation of the sleepwear standard have been
significantly reduced.  Other groups, often in conjunction
with the Commission, have attacked the problem from an
educational perspective. And certain societal changes, such
as a decline in the number of adults who smoke, have also
contributed to the decline in residential fires.  </P>
<P>     The continued need for the infants' and children's
sleepwear standard, as originally conceived, is thus hard to
quantify.  I believe the standard has played a role, and, I
also believe that the standard, as we propose to amend it,
along with a strong consumer information and education
program, will continue to play a role in reducing injuries
and deaths to our children from sleepwear ignitions.</P>

<center><H4>Statement of Chairman Ann Brown<BR>
   Children's Sleepwear<BR><BR>
             April 30, 1996<BR>
</H4></center>
<P>     For nearly 25 years, America's children have been
protected from the risk of fire from their sleepwear.Their
parents have been secure in the knowledge that their
children's sleepwear was flame resistant. The CPSC's
flammability standards for children's sleepwear have worked
to protect America's children. But today, I fear that action
is being taken that may result in a reduction of the level
of safety afforded our children and grandchildren. Based on
the record before the Commission, I cannot join with my
fellow Commissioners in amending the children's sleepwear
standards by exempting tight-fitting garments and exempting
completely garments under size 9 months.  </P>
<P>     In deciding whether to amend the children's sleepwear
flammability standards, my primary concern has been and will
continue to be the safety of children. According to the
staff, exempting tight-fitting 100% cotton sleepwear from
the children's sleepwear flammability standards, and
exempting infants' garments regardless of whether they are
tight-fitting, should not reduce the level of safety
afforded by the existing standards. I believe this is
speculative. </P>
<P>     Available injury and death data demonstrate to me that
the sleepwear standards are working. There have been very
few injuries or deaths involving the ignition of children's
sleepwear in recent years. I attribute this low level of
injury and death primarily to the sleepwear standards.  </P>
<P>     I agree with the staff's conclusion that tight-fitting
cotton garments present less of a hazard than loose-fitting
cotton garments. But garments that comply with the existing
sleepwear standards provide the best protection. There
simply is no factual basis to conclude that by amending the
sleepwear standards to allow the use of 100% cotton
garments, parents will switch from loose-fitting cotton
garments (e.g. t-shirts) to exempt tight-fitting sleepwear.
There is no evidence of consumer demand for tight-fitting
sleepwear. Indeed, it is just as likely consumers will
purchase tight-fitting garments in larger sizes to increase
comfort, and to allow a child to grow into the garment,
thereby obviating any possible safety benefit staff has
indicated might be achieved with tight-fitting garments.  </P>
<P>     Further, I am concerned that any purchase of
tight-fitting garments will be at the expense of garments
that meet the children's sleepwear flammability standards.
If so, the level of safety afforded children may well be
reduced.  </P>
<P>     I am also concerned that there will be a significantly
decreased market for flame-resistant garments, and that,
except for girls'nightgowns, flame-resistant garments could
disappear from the market. Finally, rather than amending the
standards with the understanding that the amendments could
be revisited if injuries or deaths occur, we should rely on
the existing standards to continue protecting our
children.</P>
<P>     I am particularly concerned with the vote to exempt
from the flammability standards completely, garments under
size 9 months. As any parent knows, children under 9 months
of age often are mobile and can come in contact with
ignition sources. In 1978, the Commission also considered
whether to exempt from the flammability standards garments
for young children, at that time it was garments under size
1 (generally worn by children under 12 months of age). At
that time, the Commission reviewed 10 cases involving
sleepwear garments. 43 Fed. Reg. 31,348 (July 21, 1978).
Four of the infants in these 10 sleepwear cases were
protected by their garments from more serious burn injuries.
Two of these garments were reported to be flame resistant,
and one other was thought to be flame resistant.  The four
victims sustained burn injuries only to the exposed areas of
the body, and all four survived.  In five other cases, the
garments ignited contributing to or causing the burn injury.
All five victims sustained severe burns. Id. Based on this
information, the Commission rejected exempting garments
under size 1. This same information leads me to conclude not
to vote to amend the sleepwear standards to exempt garments
under size 9 months.  </P>
<P>     I recognize that there may be a consumer preference for
cotton garments. I understand and am sympathetic to this
preference.  But, it is the Commission's responsibility
under the Flammable Fabrics Act to protect the public
against the unreasonable risk of fire leading to death,
injury or significant property damage. Based on the existing
record, I conclude that the potentially higher risk of
injury to infants and children from burns exceeds the
possible benefits of 100 percent untreated cotton garments.  </P>
<P>     I do support the need to educate parents, new parents
in particular, of the flammability danger presented by
loose, flowing garments worn by children near sources of
ignition. At least one major trade association and one major
children's clothing manufacturer has indicated a willingness
to join with the Commission in an education campaign to warn
consumers of the flammability risk of loose, flowing
garments. I urge them to do so.</P>

<B>Children and Bilingualism</B>

<P>   According to the 1990 United States Census, one in seven or 31.8
million people speak a language other than English in their home. In the
past, second generation children were encouraged to adopt the customs,
culture, and language of what was identified as the majority culture.
Today, with greater recognition and celebration of cultural differences,
people are more likely to maintain and share their primary language with
their children and to promote bilingualism as a reflection of ethnic pride
and identity.</P>

<B>What is Bilingualism?</B>

<P>   Different people use the term in different ways. For some,
bilingualism means an equal ability to communicate in two languages. For
others, bilingualism means the ability to communicate in two languages but
with the possibility of greater skills in one language.</P>

<B>How Do I Teach My Child to be Bilingual?</B>

<P>   There are different theories on the "best" way to teach a child to
use two languages. Most researchers agree that a child who is exposed to
two languages at an early age, and simultaneously, will naturally learn to
use both languages.</P>

<P>   Children can be expected to go through some periods of mixing the two
languages and borrowing vocabulary to express ideas, sometimes within the
same sentence. This occurs because vocabulary may exist in one language but
not in the other. Or words from one language may convey a message that is
not easily translated into the other language. A separation of the two
languages will occur gradually. Children may also experiment with the two
languages to create special effects or to express themselves in specific
settings. For example, one language may be identified as less formal and
used for information about events related to home and family. The other
language may be identified as more formal and used for activities outside
the home. There may also be periods when one language is used more than the
other. The opposite occurs with a change in the environment.</P>
 <P>  Children may not be equally skilled in both languages. It is common
for there to be greater understanding than actual use of one language. Less
confusion will occur if children learn to associate the two languages
differently, for example if one language is used while speaking to the
mother and the other while speaking to the father.</P>

<B>Will Using Two Languages Cause Speech Language Problems?</B>

<P>   In general, speech-language problems are less likely to occur when
both languages are introduced early and simultaneously. There is a greater
possibility of problems if children are introduced to a second language
during the preschool years after another language was used exclusively.
Some people believe that if a second language is introduced before the
first language is fully developed, the development of the first language
may be slowed or even regress. Others believe that the skill level of the
second language will develop only to that of the first.</P>
<P>   Parents who are concerned about their child's speech-language
development should contact a speech-language pathologist. An appropriate
evaluation of skills will include evaluation of both languages, and will be
completed by a bilingual speech-language pathologist or one who has
knowledge of the rules and structure of both languages and the assistance
of a translator or interpreter. The discovery that a child has some delays
in both languages does not necessarily indicate a need for professional
services. These delays may be characteristic of a two language learner.</P>

<H4>What is otitis media?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Otitis media is an inflammation in the middle ear (the area behind the eardrum) that is usually   associated with a buildup of fluid. The fluid may      or may not be infected.</p>

<li>Symptoms, severity, frequency, and length of   the condition vary. At one extreme is a single  short period of thin, clear, noninfected fluid without any pain or fever but with a slight  decrease in hearing ability. The other extreme is   repeated bouts with infection, thick "glue-like"   fluid, and possible complications such as permanent hearing loss.</p>

<li>Fortunately, with early identification, serious   medical complications can be controlled with   medicine or surgery. However, there is one   problem that nearly always occurs with all types   of otitis media-fluctuating hearing loss.
</ul>


<H4>How common is otitis media?</H4>
     
<ul>
<li>Otitis media occurs most frequently in children.
 In fact, it ranks second to the common cold as the most common health problem in preschool children. Fifty percent of children have had at least one episode by one year of age. Between one and three years, 35% will have had repeated episodes. For school children, an estimated 5 million school days are missed every year due to otitis media.</ul>

<H4>Why is otitis media so common in children?</H4>

<ul>
<li>The Eustachian tube, a passage between the middle ear and the back of the throat, is smaller   and more nearly horizontal in children than in adults. Therefore, it can be more easily blocked by conditions such as large adenoids and      infections. Until the Eustachian tube changes in      size and angle, children are more susceptible to  otitis media.</ul>

<H4>How can otitis media cause a hearing loss?</H4>
<ul>
<li>Three tiny bones in the middle ear carry sound 
vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.
When fluid is present, the vibrations are not      transmitted efficiently and sound energy is lost. The result may be a mild or even a moderate hearing loss. Therefore, some speech sounds may be muffled or inaudible.<br><br>

<li>Generally, this type of hearing loss is temporary. However, when otitis media occurs over and over again, damage to the eardrum, the bones of the ear, or even the hearing nerve can occur and cause permanent hearing loss.</ul>


<H4>Can hearing loss due to otitis media cause  speech and language problems?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Children learn speech and language from  listening to other people talk. The first few years of life are especially critical for this development.
<br><br>
<li>If a hearing loss exists, a child does not get      full benefit of language learning experiences. Consequently, critical delays in speech and      language development may occur.<br><br>
<li>Otitis media without infection presents a      special problem because symptoms of pain and      fever are usually not present. Therefore, weeks,      and even months, can go by before parents      suspect a problem. During this time, the child      may miss out on hearing the speech and      language needed for normal development.
</ul>


<H4>How can I tell if my child might have otitis  media?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Even if there is no pain or fever, there are other      signs you can look for that may indicate chronic      or recurring fluid in the ear: inattentiveness,      wanting the television or radio louder than      usual, misunderstanding directions, listlessness,      unexplained irritability, pulling or scratching the      ears.</ul>


<H4>What should I do if I think that otitis media      is causing a hearing, speech, or language      problem?</H4>

<ul>
<li>A physician should handle the medical treatment. Ear infections require immediate  attention, most likely from a pediatrician or      otolaryngologist (ear doctor). If your child has      frequently recurring infections and/or chronic  fluid in the middle ear, two additional specialists

should be consulted: an audiologist and a speech-language pathologist.<br><br>

     <li>An audiologist's evaluation will assess the severity of any hearing impairment, even in a very young or uncooperative child, and will indicate if a middle ear disorder is present.
<br><br>     
<li>A speech-language pathologist measures your
     child's specific speech and language skills and
     can recommend and/or provide remedial
     programs when they are needed.
</ul>

<H4>Will my physician refer my child for these   special evaluations?</H4>

<ul>
<li>As a parent, you are the best person to look for      signs that suggest poor hearing. The American      Academy of Pediatrics recognizes this when it      states, "Any child whose parent expresses      concern about whether the child hears should   be considered for referral for behavioral      audiometry without delay."
<br><br>
     <li>Parents should not be afraid to let their
     instincts guide them in requesting or
     independently arranging for further evaluation
     whenever they are concerned about their
     children's health or development.</ul>

    <H4> How can I find an audiologist or speech-
     language pathologist?</H4>

<h2> Early Ways To  Predict Poor Readers</h2>

<H3>Children who read well tend to do well in school.</H3> 
<p>Those
who have trouble  reading, unless helped, generally have trouble with
school. But typically, parents must wait for low grades or notes from the
teacher to find out if their child is having trouble reading.<p>

<p>Now, new research from Boston University and Emerson College in Boston
suggests that a child's performance on certain language tasks may predict
later reading problems. This is true even when these children do not show
clear signs of language difficulties in daily life, say the researchers.<p>

 <p>    "Children who have trouble reading often have underlying
speech and language problems," says Paula Menyuk, professor of
developmental studies and applied linguistics at Boston University.<p>

<p>One hundred eighty children were tested three times between the ages of
1/2 and 7 1/2. The tests examined the children's performance at different
levels of language: sounds, words, sentences, and discourse. Then, when the
children reached first or second grade, they were tested for oral language,
reading, mathematics, and spelling abilities.<p>

<p>In the study, 48 children turned out to have reading problems. The
language tasks used by the Boston researchers in the first part of the
study identified 36 of these children.<p>

<p>Poor performance on three language tasks was an especially good
predictor of later reading problems:<p>

<ul>
<li> <STRONG>understanding complex sentences</STRONG>, such as "The boy who
kissed the girl ran away."
<p>
<li><STRONG>selecting missing words in sentences</STRONG>, such as "The
girls decorated the ______tree." (Christmas, big, bare)
<p>
<li> <STRONG>retrieving words rapidly</STRONG>, for example, quickly naming
a series of 36 unrelated pictures.
</ul>
<p> Some of the children who had reading problems had nothing remarkable in
their developmental histories except very low birthweight (under 1500
grams). Jacqueline Liebergott, professor of communication disorders at
Emerson, speculated that these early medical difficulties may have had an
effect on language development that was not apparent until the children
started to learn to read.<p>

<p>Being able to predict which children will have trouble reading would
allow speech-language pathologists and others to begin to work with them
before they fail, says Menvuk.<p>

<h3> <a name="Introduction">Introduction </a></h3>

<p>Brian is a 14-year-old who is repeating the seventh grade. Art is his
favorite and best subject. In other subjects, he struggles to maintain a
C average. His teachers comment about his lack of organization, his
difficulty following directions, and his 'class clown' behavior. He never
seems to quite fit in with the crowd. His level of frustration is rising
along with his truancy rate. Many things may be contributing to Brian's
difficulties, including a possible language disorder.<p>

<h3> <a name="Language Skills">Language Skills</a></h3>
<p>
<p>The ability to read and write is strongly influenced by the ability to
understand and use language. Students who are good listeners and speakers
tend to become strong readers and writers. Language has a major role in
all subjects including reading, math, history, geography, and even art.
The early school years emphasize language development, sociaI-emotional
growth and readiness skills. The middle grades emphasize specific
subjects. Mastery of language is assumed. Emphasis is placed on written
skills. The later grades involve more complex use of language by
students, including an increased vocabulary, more advanced sentence
structure, and different kinds of language for different situations.<p>

<p>The importance of early identification and remediation of language delays
or disorders in young children is well known. Less commonly known is the
importance of identifying and remediating language disorders in the
adolescent. Such disorders may lead to feelings of failure, low
self-esteem, poor academic and social success, and a high drop out rate.<p>

including phonology, morphology, and syntax, for  example, misuse or
misunderstanding of the information provided by  word endings: "The
boy eat his dinner."
<p>
<li><STRONG>semantics (meaning)</STRONG>,
for    example, difficulty  understanding idioms: "It's  raining cats and dogs."
<p>
<li><STRONG>pragmatics (function)</STRONG>,
for  example, using language for  different purposes (promising,
requesting),  changing language for  listener needs (peer vs.teacher), or
following the rules of conversation (turn taking, introducing topics of
conversation, and staying on the topic).

    <li>those who received no      intervention;
<p>
    <li>those who had normal      language development but
experienced a disruption      because of some physical,      emotional,

<h3> <a name="Evaluation">Evaluation</a></h3>
<p>
<p>A student's understanding and use of language, hearing, thinking
abilities, emotional and social skills, desire to interact and
communicate with others, central and peripheral nervous system
functioning, and type of language models are assessed
in order to identify exactly any kind
of language disorder that exists and to rule out other causes of the
behaviors. The speech-language pathologist works closely with other
professionals, such as the school psychologist, to make these decisions.<p>

<p>     Intervention techniques may
focus on working to improve pragmatic skills and thinking skills. The
student will be taught strategies for learning new information and skills.<p>

<h2> <a name="Introduction">Introduction </a></h2>

<p>Brian is a 14-year-old who is repeating the seventh grade. Art is his
favorite and best subject. In other subjects, he struggles to maintain a
C average. His teachers comment about his lack of organization, his
difficulty following directions, and his 'class clown' behavior. He never
seems to quite fit in with the crowd. His level of frustration is rising
along with his truancy rate. Many things may be contributing to Brian's
difficulties, including a possible language disorder.<p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Language Skills">Language Skills </a></h2>
<p>
<p>The ability to read and write is strongly influenced by the ability to
understand and use language. Students who are good listeners and speakers
tend to become strong readers and writers. Language has a major role in
all subjects including reading, math, history, geography, and even art.
The early school years emphasize language development, sociaI-emotional
growth and readiness skills. The middle grades emphasize specific
subjects. Mastery of language is assumed. Emphasis is placed on written
skills. The later grades involve more complex use of language by
students, including an increased vocabulary, more advanced sentence
structure, and different kinds of language for different situations.<p>

<p>The importance of early identification and remediation of language delays
or disorders in young children is well known. Less commonly known is the
importance of identifying and remediating language disorders in the
adolescent. Such disorders may lead to feelings of failure, low
self-esteem, poor academic and social success, and a high drop out rate.<p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Language Disorders">Language Disorders</a></h2>
<p>
<p>Language disorder refers to any impairment in
<ol>
<li><STRONG>form</STRONG>
including phonology, morphology, and syntax, for  example, misuse or
misunderstanding of the information provided by  word endings: "The
boy eat his dinner."
<p>
<li><STRONG>semantics (meaning)</STRONG>,
for    example, difficulty  understanding idioms: "It's  raining cats and dogs."
<p>
<li><STRONG>pragmatics (function)</STRONG>,
for  example, using language for  different purposes (promising,
requesting),  changing language for  listener needs (peer vs.teacher), or
following the rules of conversation (turn taking, introducing topics of
conversation, and staying on the topic).
</ol>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Adolescents With Language Disorder">Adolescents With Language
Disorder</a></h2>
<p>
 Adolescents identified with
language disorders include:
<ol>     <li>those initially identified      through early intervention
programs. Although they      have received treatment and      treatment
may have reduced      the severity of the problem,      some language
difficulties      persist;
<p>
    <li>those who received no      intervention;
<p>
    <li>those who had normal      language development but
experienced a disruption      because of some physical,      emotional,
or traumatic      event; and
<p>
    <li>those who have been      identified as having a      learning
disability.
</ol>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Evaluation">Evaluation</a></h2>
<p>
<p>A student's understanding and use of language, hearing, thinking
abilities, emotional and social skills, desire to interact and
communicate with others, central and peripheral nervous system
functioning, and type of language models are assessed
in order to identify exactly any kind
of language disorder that exists and to rule out other causes of the
behaviors. The speech-language pathologist works closely with other
professionals, such as the school psychologist, to make these decisions.<p>

<p>     Intervention techniques may
focus on working to improve pragmatic skills and thinking skills. The
student will be taught strategies for learning new information and skills.<p>
<p>

<h2> <a name="Introduction">Introduction </a> </h2>
<p>The ability to pay attention is an important prerequisite to success in
school. Any difficulty with attending skills can have an adverse effect
on learning. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) refers to
the approximately 1 in every 20 (3-5%) of school-age children who have
significant difficulty with attention. Although the specific cause of
ADHD is still unknown, research has indicated the possibility of a
genetic or other prenatal cause.<p>

<p>The terms used to identify these children have changed as knowledge of
the.disorder has increased. In the past, terms such as minimal brain
damage or minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), learning disability (LI), or
hyperactive or hyperkinetic were used depending on the child's major area
of difficulty. Today, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is used to
recognize the important relationship between attending skills and the
ability to learn.<p>

<p>ADHD is the term used when the primary characteristic is significant
inattentiveness and impulsivity with or without hyperactivity. The child
often fails to finish projects, seems not to listen, is easily
distracted, and has difficulty concentrating even on a chosen task. Other
thoughts. sights, or sounds keep getting in the way, especially when the
task is difficult
or uninteresting. The child acts before thinking, switches from activity
to activity, needs a lot of supervision, and has difficulty with
organization of time, work, and belongings.<p>

<p>Hyperactivity often occurs with inattentiveness and impulsivity. The
child has difficulty sitting still, fidgets excessively, has difficulty
staying seated, and moves about excessively even during sleep. Onset
occurs before the age of 7 years. Behaviors are chronic (present
throughout the child's life), pervasive (present throughout the child's
day), and are not due to other factors such as anxiety or depression.<p>

<p>Attention deficit disorder
residual type (ADDRET) is sometimes used to indicate residual attention
deficit disorder (ADD) in older adolescents who were
previously identified as ADHD at a younger age but who no longer exhibit
hyperactivity. Approximately 50% of those with ADHD will mature out of
ADHD at puberty.<p>

<p>ADHD is present in children with average ability and in those who are
gifted. It affects boys and girls, but is more prevalent in boys. Most
often, these children appear restless and fidgety, but some children
appear lethargic, shy, and withdrawn. They may shout out answers in class
or respond reluctantly after prodding by the teacher. Work is often
incomplete and disorganized. At times, some children appear to be in
their own little world and are often falsely accused of not trying hard
enough, of being lazy, or of just not caring.
Social and emotional problems are common. They may be rejected by their
peers. Academic difficulties, behavioral problems, low, self-esteem,
aggressiveness, and, at times depression may occur.<p>

<h2> <a name="ADHD and Learning Disabilities">ADHD and Learning
Disabilities </a> </h2>

<p>ADHD and learning disabilities frequently occur together, however, they
are not the same. Learning disabilities include difficulty with
receiving, organizing,
understanding, remembering, and offering information.  ADHD involves
difficulty with paying attention to information. Between 10 and 20% of
all school-aged children have learning disabilities. of those with LD,
about 20 to 25% will also have ADHD.<p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Identification">Identification</a> </h2>
<p>
<p>Behavioral problems, poor
school work, and learning difficulties may be the first indicators of a
need for evaluation. Diagnosis is based on the history of the problem or
behavior, and whether it is chronic and pervasive. A complete evaluation
includes a
team review of the child's medical, psychological, educational, and
behavioral strengths and areas of difficulty by audiologists,
speech-language pathologists, pediatricians, psychologists. special
educators, psychiatrists, and neurologists.<p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Treatment">Treatment</a> </h2>
<p>
 <p>Audiologists and speech -language pathologists are specialists in human
communication.
An audiologist should be consulted to measure hearing ability, evaluate
auditory skills, identify the presence and severity of any problem, and
provide appropriate recommendations. A speech- language pathologist
should be consulted to evaluate speech and language skills, identify
areas of strength and weakness in communication, and provide appropriate
recommendations and treatment, if indicated.<p>

<p>Medication (such as Toframil, Desipramine, Catapress, Tegretol,
Dexedrine, Ritalin, and Cylert) may be prescribed to control or treat
symptoms by a physician who is familiar with ADHD.<p>

<p>Educational interventions such
as accommodations within the regular education classroom (for example,
preferential seating in the classroom and elimination of distraction),
compensatory educational instruction (for example, repeating and
simplifying instructions, tutoring,  and use of a daily assignment
notebook), or placement in special education programs may be suggested.<p>

<p>Family and/or individual treatment may help to deal with aggression,
frustration, and disappointment, and feelings of failure in getting along
with family, school personnel, and peers.<p>

<p>Previous treatment approaches including food-additive-free diet,
elimination of sugar and megavitamin treatment have been found to be of
little value.<p>

<ul>
<li>Why is speech-language treatment needed? My baby doesn't talk yet!<br><br>

<li>That's just "baby-talk". I'm sure my child will outgrow it.<br><br>

<li>Everyone in our family was a late talker.  My child will talk when the time is right.<br><br>

<li>Why worry now? Speech and language services will be available when school starts.<br><br>

<li>Treatment? Looks like they are just playing games to me.
</ul>

<p>You may have had similar thoughts or comments. Usually, there is concern 
about a child's speech and language skills if there is no speech by the age of 1 
year, if speech is not clear, or if speech or language is different from that of 
other children of the same age.</p>

<H4>What is Early Identification?</H4> 

<p>It is estimated that 2% of all children born each year will have a disabling condition. Many of these children will have  speech and or language delays and disorders that may have a significant effect  on personal,  social,  academic, or vocational life. Although some children will  develop normal speech and language skills without treatment by the time  they enter school,  it is important to identify those who will not.
</p>

<p>Many people falsely believe that speech-language treatment cannot and 
should not begin until a child begins to talk. Yet research has shown that 
children know a great deal about their language even before the first word is said.  For example, children can distinguish between 
their native language and a foreign language, use different nonverbal 
utterances to express different needs, and imitate different patterns of speech  through babbling. </p>

<p>Early identification includes the evaluation and treatment provided to 
families and their children under  3 years old who have, or are at risk for 
having, a disability, or delay in speech, language or hearing. A child can 
quickly fall behind if speech and language learning is delayed. Early 
identification increases the chances  for improving communication skills.</p>

<H4>Who Should be Evaluated?</H4>

<p>Children identified as at-risk or high-risk, such as those from neonatal 
intensive care (NICU) units, should be tested early and at regular intervals. 
Other risk factors include diagnosed medical conditions, for example, chronic 
ear infections; biological factors, for example. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; genetic  defects, for example Down syndrome:   neurological defects, for example. cerebral palsy; or developmental disorders, for example, delayed language.</p>

<p>Children with no high-risk features should be evaluated if their speech and 
language is not similar to other children of the same age.</p>

<H4>How is the Evaluation Done?</H4>

<p>Evaluation may be formal or informal and include any combination of standardized tests; direct observation of play and interaction with caregivers; report by parent, 
teacher, or physician; and collection and detailed analysis of spontaneous 
speech samples.</p>

<p>Several sessions as well as ongoing evaluation may be required to obtain 
enough information to make an accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p>The early identification team may consist of the speech-language pathologist, 
audiologist, psychologist, neurologist, 
electrophysiologist, otolaryngologist,  pediatrician, nurse, and social
worker. Because speech-language delays and disorders may be due to a variety 
of causes, each professional makes valuable contributions to the evaluation.</p>

<H4>What is Speech-Language Treatment?</H4>

<p>From the results of the evaluation, certain services may be recommended. Prevention includes those  children who have been identified as at-risk, for example, due to low  birthweight, for a communication delay or disorder.</p>

<p>Services are provided 
before a specific diagnosis has been made. Remediation increases function in 
areas identified as delayed or disabling and may serve to prevent other related 
problems. For example, remediation of a language disorder can help to offset 
learning difficulties. Compensation enables the child and the family to make 
adjustments for limitations, as in some cases of cerebral palsy.</p>

<p>Language is taught in a natural
setting. It is presented at the child's developmental level; responses are 
consistently stimulated; and output is rewarded. Play may be used to teach 
communication, language models or rules of conversation, such as turn 
taking.</p>

<p>Feeding and swallowing
treatment may be needed to sustain life. It can also be used to encourage 
speech-like movements, stimulate sound production, or increase the child's 
awareness of speech movements.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about a possible speech-language delay or disability, 
consult a speech-language pathologist. <STRONG>A list of certified speech-language 
pathologists in your area may be obtained by calling the American Speech-
Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA) toll-free HELPLINE at 1-800-638-
8255.</STRONG></p>

<h2>Early Identification of Speech-Language Delays and Disorders</h2>
<h3>From: Let's Talk...  No. 32 <br><br>Courtesy of <br>
<a href="/ASHA/index.html">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association</a> </h3>
</center>
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Why is speech-language treatment needed? My baby doesn't talk yet!<br><br>

<li>That's just "baby-talk". I'm sure my child will outgrow it.<br><br>

<li>Everyone in our family was a late talker.  My child will talk when the time is right.<br><br>

<li>Why worry now? Speech and language services will be available when school starts.<br><br>

<li>Treatment? Looks like they are just playing games to me.
</ul>

<p>You may have had similar thoughts or comments. Usually, there is concern 
about a child's speech and language skills if there is no speech by the age of 1 
year, if speech is not clear, or if speech or language is different from that of 
other children of the same age.</p>

<H3>What is Early Identification?</H3> 

<p>It is estimated that 2% of all children born each year will have a disabling condition. Many of these children will have  speech and or language delays and disorders that may have a significant effect  on personal,  social,  academic, or vocational life. Although some children will  develop normal speech and language skills without treatment by the time  they enter school,  it is important to identify those who will not.
</p>

<p>Many people falsely believe that speech-language treatment cannot and 
should not begin until a child begins to talk. Yet research has shown that 
children know a great deal about their language even before the first word is said.  For example, children can distinguish between 
their native language and a foreign language, use different nonverbal 
utterances to express different needs, and imitate different patterns of speech  through babbling. </p>

<p>Early identification includes the evaluation and treatment provided to 
families and their children under  3 years old who have, or are at risk for 
having, a disability, or delay in speech, language or hearing. A child can 
quickly fall behind if speech and language learning is delayed. Early 
identification increases the chances  for improving communication skills.</p>

<H3>Who Should be Evaluated?</H3>

<p>Children identified as at-risk or high-risk, such as those from neonatal 
intensive care (NICU) units, should be tested early and at regular intervals. 
Other risk factors include diagnosed medical conditions, for example, chronic 
ear infections; biological factors, for example. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; genetic  defects, for example Down syndrome:   neurological defects, for example. cerebral palsy; or developmental disorders, for example, delayed language.</p>

<p>Children with no high-risk features should be evaluated if their speech and 
language is not similar to other children of the same age.</p>

<H3>How is the Evaluation Done?</H3>

<p>Evaluation may be formal or informal and include any combination of standardized tests; direct observation of play and interaction with caregivers; report by parent, 
teacher, or physician; and collection and detailed analysis of spontaneous 
speech samples.</p>

<p>Several sessions as well as ongoing evaluation may be required to obtain 
enough information to make an accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p>The early identification team may consist of the speech-language pathologist, 
audiologist, psychologist, neurologist, 
electrophysiologist, otolaryngologist,  pediatrician, nurse, and social
worker. Because speech-language delays and disorders may be due to a variety 
of causes, each professional makes valuable contributions to the evaluation.</p>

<H3>What is Speech-Language Treatment?</H3>

<p>From the results of the evaluation, certain services may be recommended. Prevention includes those  children who have been identified as at-risk, for example, due to low  birthweight, for a communication delay or disorder.</p>

<p>Services are provided 
before a specific diagnosis has been made. Remediation increases function in 
areas identified as delayed or disabling and may serve to prevent other related 
problems. For example, remediation of a language disorder can help to offset 
learning difficulties. Compensation enables the child and the family to make 
adjustments for limitations, as in some cases of cerebral palsy.</p>

<p>Language is taught in a natural
setting. It is presented at the child's developmental level; responses are 
consistently stimulated; and output is rewarded. Play may be used to teach 
communication, language models or rules of conversation, such as turn 
taking.</p>

<p>Feeding and swallowing
treatment may be needed to sustain life. It can also be used to encourage 
speech-like movements, stimulate sound production, or increase the child's 
awareness of speech movements.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about a possible speech-language delay or disability, 
consult a speech-language pathologist. <STRONG>A list of certified speech-language 
pathologists in your area may be obtained by calling the American Speech-
Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA) toll-free HELPLINE at 1-800-638-
8255.</STRONG></p>

<H4>What is stuttering?</H4>

<ul><li>Stuttering is the condition in which the flow of speech is broken by abnormal stoppages (no sound), repetitions (st-st-stuttering), or prolongations (ssssstuttering) of sounds and syllables. There may also be unusual facial and body movements associated with the effort to speak.
</ul>


<H4>Aren't all people nonfluent to some extent?</H4>

<ul><li>Yes. Almost all children go through a      stage of frequent nonfluency in early      speech development. Adults may interject syllables ("uh") and occasionally      repeat words, phrases and sounds,      but these nonfluencies are accepted as      normal and usually are not a cause for      concern.
</ul>
<H4>Does stammering mean the same thing  as stuttering?</H4>

<ul><li>Most people use the terms
     interchangeably.
</ul>

<H4>What causes stuttering?</H4>

<ul><li>We still do not know for a fact what      causes stuttering. It may have different      causes in different people, or it may occur only when a combination of factors      comes together. It is also quite possible      that what causes stuttering is quite different from what makes it continue or      get worse. Possible influences include      incoordination of the speech muscles;      rate of language development; the way      parents and others talk to the child; and      other forms of communication and life      stress.
</ul>

<H4>Is stuttering caused by emotional or  psychological problems?</H4>

<ul><li>Children who stutter are no more likely      to have psychological problems than      children who do not stutter. In general,      there is no reason to believe that emotional trauma causes stuttering.
</ul>


<H4>At what age is stuttering likely to appear?</H4>

<ul><li>Stuttering typically begins at a very early age (usually between 2 and 5 years),      but will occasionally appear for the first      time in a school-age child and, more      rarely, in an adult.
</ul>

<H4>If I think my child is beginning to stutter, should I wait or seek help?</H4>

<ul><li>You should seek a professional evaluation as soon as you become concerned.      Most children outgrow their nonfluency,      but others will not. The problem of stuttering may be prevented from developing if treated early enough.
</ul>

<H4>Once stuttering has developed, can it be treated?</H4>

<ul><li>Yes, there are a variety of successful approaches for treating both children and      adults. There are no published scientific      data that indicate the general superiority of any one of these approaches.
</ul>

<H4>Can stuttering be "cured"?</H4>

<ul><li>It is best to avoid thinking in terms of an absolute "cure" for stuttering. Stuttering is not a disease. The goal should be to progress toward improved fluency  and success in communicating.
</ul>

<H4>What should I do when I hear a child speaking nonfluently?</H4>	


<ul><li>Children may be unaware that they are 	speaking nonfluently. Do not call attention to the nonfluent speech pattern. <br><br> 	

<li>Do not say "Stop and start over," 		"Think before you talk," "Talk slower," 		or "Cat got your tongue?" Listen patiently and carefully to what the child is 		saying, and do not focus on how it is 		being said.  	
</ul>

<H4>What should I do when I hear an adult stuttering?</H4>  	

<ul><li>Adults who stutter need the same patience and attention to their ideas as 		speakers who don't stutter. Don't look 		away and don't hurry them or fill in 		words. This attempt to help can create 		anxiety and self-consciousness and 		make the problem worse.  
</ul>

<H4>Who can help with this problem?</H4>  

<ul><li>A speech-language pathologist who has had experience in dealing with the stuttering problems of children and adults. The speech-language pathologist is the professional who is trained at the master's or doctoral degree level to evaluate the person who stutters and prepare a plan to improve speech.<br><br>

<li>Speech-language pathologists hold the Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) from the American Speech- Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and/or a license from your state.<BR><BR>

<ul><li>Articulation is the process by which sounds, syllables, 	and words are formed when your tongue, jaw, teeth, lips, and  palate alter the air stream coming from the 	vocal folds.
</ul>  

<H4>What is an  articulation problem?</H4>
 
<ul><li>A person has an articulation problem when 
he or she produces sounds, syllables. or words incorrectly so that listeners 
do not understand what is being said or pay more attention to the way 
the words sound than to what they mean. 
</ul>

<H4>Is an articulation problem 
the same as "baby talk"?</H4> 

<ul><li>An articulation problem sometimes sounds 
like baby 	talk because many very young children do 	mispronounce 
sounds, syllables, and words. But words that sound cute when 
mispronounced by  young children interfere with the communication 
of 	older children or adults. Older children and adults 	have so many 
severe errors that their articulation 	problems are very different from "baby 
talk."
</ul>

<H4>What are some types of sound errors?</H4>

<ul><li>Most errors fall into one of three categories-
     omissions, substitutions, or distortions. An example   of an omission is 
"at" for "hat" or "oo" for "shoe."      An example of a substitution is the use of 
"w" for      "r." which makes "rabbit" sound like "wabbit," or      the 
substitution of "th" for "s" so that "sun" is      pronounced "thun." When the 
sound is said      inaccurately, but sounds something like the intended      
sound, it is called a distortion.
</ul>

<H4>What causes an articulation problem?</H4>

<ul><li>Articulation problems may result from physical      handicaps, such as 
cerebral palsy, cleft palate. or      hearing loss, or may be related to other 
problems in      the mouth, such as dental problems. However, most      
articulation problems occur in the absence of any   obvious physical 
disability. The cause of these so-called functional articulation problems may be faulty      learning of speech 
sounds.
</ul>

<H4>Is an accent an articulation problem?</H4>

<ul><li>It can be for some persons. We all have accents-
Southern, Eastern, Northern, Western, Chicago,
Pittsburgh, Brooklyn, or Boston. An accent may be a problem if it interferes with a person's goals in life.
</ul>

<H4>Can ear problems during infancy have any effect on
     late sound development?</H4>

<ul><li>Children learn their speech sounds by listening to the      speech around  them. This learning begins very early      in life. If children have frequent ear  problems during   this important listening period. they may fail to learn      some speech sounds.
</ul>

<H4>Will a child outgrow a functional articulation problem?</H4>

<ul><li>A child's overall speech pattern will usually become    more understandable as he or she matures. but   some children will need direct 
training to eliminate all   articulation errors. The exact speech pattern of the      
individual child will determine the answer to this      question.
</ul>

<H4>Do children learn all sounds at once?</H4>

<ul><li>Sounds are learned in an orderly sequence. Some sounds, such as "p," 
"m," and "b," are learned as early as 3 years of age. Other sounds, like "s," 
"r,' and "l," often are not completely mastered until the early school years.
<br><br>
<li>At what age should a child be producing all sounds correctly?
Children should make all the sounds of English by 8   years of age. Many 
children learn these sounds much   earlier.
</ul>

<H4>How can I help a child pronounce words correctly?</H4>

<ul><li>By setting a good example. Don't interrupt or      constantly correct the 
child. Don't let anyone tease      or mock (including friends or relatives). 
Instead,  present a good model. Use the misarticulated word      correctly 
with emphasis. If the child says, "That's a      big wabbit," you say "Yes, that is a 
big rabbit. A big  white rabbit. Would you like to have a rabbit?"
</ul>

<H4>Can an adult with an articulation problem be helped?</H4>

<ul><li>As most articulation problems can be helped regardless of a person's age, but 
the longer the problem persists, the harder it is to change. Some problems.
such as those relating to nerve impulses to the muscles of articulation (dysarthria), are particularly difficult and generally will require a longer period of help than a functional disorder. Other conditions that may influence progress in a child or adult include hearing ability, condition of the oral structures such as the teeth, frequency of help obtained, motivation, intelligence, and cooperation.
</ul>

<H4>Who can help?</H4>

<ul><li>Contact a speech-language pathologist if you are      concerned about speech. A speech-language   pathologist is a professional trained at the master's or      doctoral level to evaluate and help the child or adult   with an articulation problem as well as other speech  and/or language disorders. The speech-language      pathologist should be certified by the American      Speech-Language-Hearing Association and/or      licensed by your state. The speech-language      pathologist can advise whether professional help is      indicated and how to arrange for assistance. The      speech-language pathologist can also give you      guidance or provide services to help prevent or      eliminate a problem. Early help is especially  important for more severe problems.
</ul>

<H4>Is it important to correct an articulation problem?</H4>

<ul><li>When you consider the possible impact an   articulation problem may have on one's social,   emotional, educational, and/or vocational status, the      answer becomes obvious. Our speech is an   important part of us. The quality of our lives is    affected by the adequacy of our speech.<BR><BR>

<h2>Questions and Answers about Child Language</h2>
<h3>Courtesy of <br>
<a href="/ASHA/index.html">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association</a> </h3>
</center>

<H3>What is language?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Language is a code that we learn to use in order to communicate ideas and 
express our wants and needs. Reading, writing, speaking, and some gesture 
systems are all forms of language.
</ul>

<H3>What makes up this language code?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Language is made up of a series of rules for:<br><br>
 
<ul>
<li>creating words or signs from smaller units like sounds, letters, or 
body movements<br><br>

<li>modifying the meaning of root words (e.g., girl + -s = girls, walk + -ed 
= walked, teach +   -er = teacher, quick + ly = quickly, dis- +   obey = 
disobey)<br><br>

<li>combining words together (the grammar of   the language)
attaching meaning to words<br><br>

<li>holding a conversation; telling a story; and   using different forms of 
language for different  listeners, purposes, and situations.
</ul>
</ul>

<H3>What is speech?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Speech is the spoken form of language.
</ul>

<H3>How do children learn all these language rules?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Children learn language and speech by listening to the language around them and practicing what they hear. In this way, they figure out the  rules of the language code. It is not learned all   at once but in stages over time.
</ul>

<H3>How can parents help a child learn to talk?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Talk to the child. Read to the child. Encourage the child to talk, but don't demand speech.      Make talking fun.
</ul>

<H3>How do you know that a child's language and      speech are what they 
should be for a particular   age?</H3>

<ul>
<li>There are expected language behaviors for different ages. For example, by 1 year of age a  child should use one or two words, 
follow simple requests ("Come here"), and understand simple questions ("Where's your shoe?"). By 2 - 3 years of age, the child 
should be using two or three word sentences to talk about and ask for things 
and following two requests ("Get the ball and put it on the table"), Parents 
should also understand their child's speech most of the time.
<br><br>
<li>Children are individuals and do develop at slower or faster rates than 
expected. What is most important is that the child shows continuous language growth.
</ul>

<H3>When should I seek professional help?</H3>

<ul>
<li>When you become concerned. Don't delay.      No child is too young to be 
helped. If there is  a problem, early attention is important. If   there is no 
problem, you will be relieved of  worry.
</ul>

<H3>Will hearing problems affect speech and  language development?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Yes. The first years of life are particularly important for learning speech 
and language.      Even mild hearing losses may cause children      to miss 
much of the speech and language      around them and result in critical 
developmental delays. Parents should make sure that      their children receive a regular hearing      evaluation from an audiologist certified by      the 
American Speech-Language-Hearing      Association (ASHA), particularly if 
there is a  history of ear infections, frequent colds or  other upper 
respiratory infections, or allergies.

</ul>

<H3>Are there ever other physical causes of  language disability?</H3>

<ul>
<li>There are, but most often language disability   exists without any known 
physical cause.
</ul>

<H3>How about other causes?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes children are not exposed to enough language to learn the rules. Sometimes the child has no need to talk because parents respond to pointing and gestures instead of speech. But most language disabilities occur without an identifiable cause.
</ul>

<H3>What can be done about language disabilities?</H3>

<ul>
<li>A speech-language pathologist with experience   in child development can evaluate the child's  language development, design an organized  plan of language learning, and carry out the  plan in individual or small group sessions.      Educated at the master's or doctoral  level, certified by ASHA, and licensed in  almost all states, this professional will also  help you help your child.
</ul>

<H3>Where can I find a speech-language  pathologist?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Speech-language pathologists provide services  in schools, colleges and universities, hospitals,   clinics, private practices, and other settings. To      find a speech-language pathologist near you, write or call ASHA.
</ul>

<H3>College Freshmen with Disabilities</H3>

<ul>
<li>The percentage of first-time, full-time freshmen reporting 
disabilities has increased significantly since the later 1970s.  In 1991, 
8.8 percent of all freshmen reported having some types of disability, 
compared with 2.6 percent in 1978.

<li>Sight and learning disabilities were identified most frequently 
by freshmen with disabilities in 1991, with about 25 percent 
reporting each type.  (Chart not available in on-line version)

<li>The proportion of freshmen with disabilities citing learning 
disabilities increased from 15 percent in 1985 to 25 percent in 1991.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities were more likely to be male and 
older than non-disabled students.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities expected to take longer than the 
normal time to complete their degrees and were more likely to select 
a college based on its special program offerings.

<li>Women were more likely than men to have sight and health-related disabilities and need math and science tutoring.

<li>Freshmen with orthopedic disabilities tended to be older than 
other disabled students and more likely to have finished high school 
some years before entering college or to have passed the GED exam.

<li>Freshmen with learning disabilities were most likely to be 
enrolled in two-year campuses (59 percent), while another two-fifths 
(40 percent) were enrolled at universities and four-year colleges.  
One percent were enrolled at historically black colleges and 
universities.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities who were enrolled in historically 
black colleges and universities were more likely to report being blind 
or partially sighted, or having a health related disability.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities were more likely to come from 
lower-income families and less likely to have received financial 
assistance from their families than non-disabled students.  In 
addition, disabled freshmen were less likely to contribute savings  
from summer work the previous summer.  Both disabled and non-
disabled received help from federal financial aid programs, private 
grants, and institutionally financed college loans.

<li>Across most major fields of study, disabled and other students 
expressed similar expectations.  Where they differed: students with 
disabilities were more interested in technical fields than their non-
disabled peers and less interested in being business majors.

<H3>Basis of exit for high school students, 1989-90</H3>

<ul>
<li>Over 220,000 students with disabilities left the special 
education system in 1989-90.

<li>More than four in ten students with disabilities, age 14 or 
older, graduated from high school with a diploma.

<li>More than one in ten students with disabilities, age 14 or 
older, graduated from high school with a certificate.

<li>One quarter of the students with disabilities, age 14 or older, 
dropped out of high school before completion.

<li>Students with specific learning disabilities represent the 
largest (129,000) number of the "exiting" population.  Slightly more 
than half of them (52%) were reported to have earned diplomas.  
Other groups in which more than half of the departing students 
obtained diplomas were those with visual impairment (61%), deaf-
blindness (61%), hearing impairment (59%), and orthopedic 
impairment (58%)

<H3>National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education 
Students</H3>

<p>The following data are taken from the National Longitudinal 
Transition Study of Special Education Students, conducted by SRI 
International under contract with the Office of Special Education 
Programs within the U.S. Department of Education.  The SRI data are 
based on a sample of over 8,000 special education students aged 13 
to 23 between the years 1987 to 1989.  Data was first collected in 
1987 from parent interviews, contacts with educators, and 
information from the students' school records.  Data collection was 
repeated in 1990 to track changes in experiences over time.  The 
data below highlight some of the changes in the area of participation 
in postsecondary education. </p>

<H4>Postsecondary education participation </H4>

<ul>
<li>Within the first two years after exiting high school, 15% of students 
with disabilities had attended postsecondary school during the 
preceding year; three to five years after leaving school, 27% of 
students with disabilities had ever attended postsecondary 
education.

<li> Comparatively, two years after leaving school, 56% of students 
without disabilities had attended postsecondary school during the 
preceding year; three to five years after leaving school, 68% of 
students with disabilities had ever attended postsecondary 
education.

<li>Thus, many disabled and non-disabled students alike who did not 
enroll in postsecondary education immediately after high school, do 
attend at a future date.  For both students with and without 
disabilities, enrollment rates are 12% higher three to five years after 
high school than they were two years after high school.  Students 
with disabilities are almost twice as likely to enroll in postsecondary 
education three to five years after high school as they are two years 
after high school.  However, there is still a gap in enrollment rates 
between students with disabilities and students without disabilities; 
at both time intervals, students with disabilities enroll in 
postsecondary education at significantly lower rates than do students 
without disabilities.
</ul>

<H4>Enrollment trends by disability category</H4>

<ul>
<li>Among the different disability categories, there is a great deal of 
variation in postsecondary education participation rates.  

<li>Two years after leaving high school, the participation rates for 
students who are deaf were the highest (36.4); the next largest rates 
were for students with speech impairments (34.0); and students with 
visual impairments (33.0).

<li>Three to five years after leaving high school, the participation rates 
in postsecondary education were the highest for students who are 
hard of hearing (60.4); the next highest rates were for students who 
are deaf (60.0); and students with visual impairments (57.0).

<li>Of all students with disabilities, students with sensory impairments 
attend postsecondary education at rates most similar to students 
without disabilities.

<p>
The HEATH Resource Center has recently received a number of requests for 
information on issues associated with postsecondary education for 
individuals with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).  In order to collect 
information on this emerging topic, the HEATH staff contacted Chesapeake 
Psychological Services, one of several Washington, DC metropolitan area 
resources offering comprehensive testing and follow-up support to 
individuals with varying types of disabilities.  Chesapeake Psychological 
Services has an Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Clinic, which offers 
a full range of treatment services - from educational recommendations to 
consultation with physicians. As a result of that contact, Dr. Susan Biggs and 
Dr. Kathleen Nadeau on staff at Chesapeake Psychological Services accepted 
the invitation to present a professional development program to the 
members of  the Nation's Capital Area Disability Support Services Coalition.  
What follows is a summary of the Biggs-Nadeau presentation in December 
1992. </p>

<a name="Defining"></a>
<H3>Defining ADD</H3>
<p>
The basic characteristics of adults with ADD include inattention and 
impulsivity.  Adults with ADD may be disorganized, may lose things 
frequently, and may be easily distracted from the task-at-hand.  Impulsiveness  may include a perceived need to move on immediately to a new task, thus  leaving another unfinished (they may be enthusiastic beginners but poor  completers); impatience in waiting situations, such as in stalled traffic or  standing in a slow-moving line;  a short temper; or the tendency to respond  poorly to stress and thus become easily hassled. </p>

<p>The education community divides ADD, by definition, into two similar yet 
slightly different groups.  Individuals may be defined as having either ADD 
- Attention Deficit Disorder, or ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder, or attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity.  Adults with ADD 
or ADHD may be either slow and lethargic, or restless and fidgety.  Medical 
researchers now believe that differences in chemistry in the parts of the brain  which control inhibition may cause ADD, and may be inherited.</p>  
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Historical"></a>
<H3>Historical Trends</H3>
<p>Medical and educational researchers over the past century have addressed 
various aspects of attention-related disability.  In the early 1900's,  attention- related patterns and behavior problems following brain injury were the focus  of research.  During the 1930's and 1940's, attention-related characteristics  among individuals who had not sustained brain injury or brain damage were  recognized and studied.  Our knowledge became much more defined in the  1960's, with the awareness of some of the components that play a part in an attention-related disability, such as learning disabilities, neurologic dysfunction, or behavioral symptoms.  More precision regarding the 
definition of behavioral characteristics became possible in the 1970's.  Finally,  in the 1980's, the definition of ADD was included in the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of the Mental Disorders (DSM-III).  The DSM-III is the 
official glossary of descriptions of mental health diagnosis.  The addition of 
ADD to the DSM-III led to wide recognition of it as a specific disorder.
</p>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="ADD"></a>
<H3>ADD and Adults</H3>
<p>
It is becoming clear that ADD is not a disability limited to childhood or 
adolescence.  More and more adults are discovering that they have ADD; 
current estimates are that between eight and 15 million American adults 
have the disability.  It is a high frequency and low visibility disability, 
meaning that many individuals have the disability, but its characteristics are 
not readily apparent. </p>
<p>
Some report that between one-third and one-half of children with ADD grow 
up to be adults with ADD.  While adults may be more likely to have an 
attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity, the adult will likely continue 
to experience difficulties with concentration; achieving his or her potential; 
impulsivity; behavior problems at home, school, or work; or will use poor 
judgment or have self-destructive tendencies.  Adults with ADD often 
present additional diagnoses as well, such as mild chronic depression, mood 
and energy swings, nervousness, sleep disorders, muscular tension, and/or 
learning disabilities. </p>

<p>The presence within a person of an ADD is pervasive.  It is more likely to 
affect many, or all, of an individual's life areas, rather than just one isolated 
area.  As a result, adults with ADD may experience difficulties with most life 
issues.  Some adults may be unable to complete formal education or may do 
so only with overwhelming drive.  Others may have trouble with 
interpersonal relationships.  Career problems may be present for others with 
ADD.  Career-related problems may stem from frequent job terminations 
because of poor job performance, attention and/or organization problems, 
interpersonal problems with supervisors and/or co-workers, or becoming 
easily bored and quitting a job.  Regardless of the life area in which  an adult 
with ADD is experiencing difficulties, each is likely to feel that he or she is not 
living up to his or her potential.  For relief, some may turn to intense 
physical or mental activity; others may use drugs or alcohol for self-
medication.

<a name="Diagnosis"></a>
<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
<p>Psycho-educational  diagnosticians use a system similar to the six steps 
described below when evaluating for ADD or ADHD. </p>
  
<ol><li><h4>Understanding Current Concerns and History</h4> 
<p>Diagnosticians interview the student, and possibly his or her family in order 
to garner as much information as possible.  Given the field's emerging 
knowledge about heredity and ADD, a diagnostician may look for clues to 
indicate if characteristics were present early in an individual's life, regardless 
of whether or not the individual and/or his or her family were identified as 
having any of the characteristics of this disability. </p>

<p>Some diagnosticians develop a questionnaire, such as one described by Biggs 
and Nadeau, during this phase of the evaluation process to elicit information 
about ADD or ADHD.  Such questions as "Do you feel that you are 
organized?", or "Would you describe for me your method of organization?" 
begin to provide diagnosticians with useful insights.  Throughout the 
individual's responses, the diagnostician looks for evidence that ADD 
characteristics seem to be present in situations both in and out of the school 
or campus environment.  Questions are asked to discover the areas affected by 
ADD including reading and writing skills, mathematics, attention and 
concentration abilities, language processing, visual and spatial abilities, 
memory, processing speed, social skills, and general concerns. </p>

<li><h4>Selecting Appropriate Measures to Address Concerns</h4>
<p>Diagnosticians select tests from a large inventory of assessment tools.  The  selection is based on questions raised from the client's history.  For example,  during the evaluation process, a diagnostician may administer tests which 
will produce information about the possibilities of ADD or ADHD, learning 
disabilities, emotional problems, and/or neurological issues. </p>

<li><h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
Since each individual is unique, there is no pre-determined number of tests 
that a psychlogist or psychiatrist may administer in order to assess for ADD or 
ADHD.  
The assessments usually cover the following areas: intelligence, 
cognitive/information processing, personality, and educational - if learning 
disability is suspected. </p>

<li><h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>
During this stage of the evaluation process, the diagnosticians "play 
detective" and "put clues together." </P>
  
<li><h4>Treatment Planning Conference</h4>
<p>
The treatment planning conference always includes the diagnostician and the 
student, but may also include parents, spouse, and/or an educational 
specialist.  In the conference, test results are shared and interpreted and 
recommendations are discussed.  These may include specific 
recommendations to the student regarding study skills, and 
recommendations to the college regarding needed supports and 
accommodations.  It may include recommendations for a medication 
evaluation, for psychological counseling, and/or for tutoring.  School 
placement issues may be discussed if the student is not satisfied with his or 
her current school.  For a working adult, both school and career issues may be 
discussed. </p>

<li><h4>Written Report</h4>
<p>
The diagnostician completes a full written report, including sections that list 
the tests which were given and the scores obtained, the interpretation of those 
scores, and individualized educational recommendations based on the 
students strengths and weaknesses.  Students should review the report 
thoroughly and ask any questions that they may have, or ask for the 
diagnostician to go over the report with them.  Most diagnosticians will 
schedule a follow-up appointment with the student, after he or she has 
received the written report and has had a chance to review it.  It is extremely 
important that the student understand the full contents of the report, as such 
an understanding will help the student advocate for his or her future needs.  
In addition, students should always keep a copy of the report, as well as any 
other relevant information, for their personal reference or future need. </p>
</ol>

<p>Costs of thorough evaluations, such as the six-step process described above, do 
vary and students are encouraged to become familiar with all options 
available to them before making a final choice.  Students should also check 
with their health insurance companies to see if such an evaluation is covered 
under their policy.</p>

<li><p>ADD and the College Student -A Guide for High School and College 
Students with Attention Deficit Disorder (1994), by Patricia O. Quinn, M.D. 
(editor), is a 113-page compilation of user-friendly information. While ADD 
and the College Student begins by stating that it has been written for high 
school juniors and seniors and college students with attention deficit disorder  (ADD), a diverse audience can benefit from the collection of easy-to-read 
practical advice, including adults who suspect that they may have ADD, 
family members of individuals with ADD, postsecondary service providers, 
psychologists, diagnosticians, vocational rehabilitation workers, as well as 
high school teachers and college counselors. <br><br>
The first half of this 12-chapter book answers commonly asked quesitons, lists 
the major symptoms of ADD, and contains a checklist that can be used to help 
evaluate various symptoms, gain self-awareness, and provide guidance 
regarding the necessity of seeking a professional assessment. The 
biochemistry of ADD, medication, and other treatments for ADD also are 
covered. While Dr. Quinn states that she cannot endorse any of the 
alternative therapies at this point in time, she explains the basics of 
biofeedback therapy, self-control or cognitive therapy, and diet and 
megavitamin therapy. How ADD Affects You focuses on the most common 
issues faced by adolescents with ADD, both academic and social, and ends 
with personal commentaries from two college students with ADD. <br><br>

The second half of ADD and the College Student begins with Preparing for 
College: A Mother's Perspective. This personal story concludes with helpful 
hints for college students with ADD and for their parents. The remainder of 
the book leads readers through senior year at high school, college programs, 
and accommodations for students with ADD. The support services that 
postsecondary students with ADD may find helpful are described. Dr. Quinn 
points out that students can best understand which support services may be 
most helpful to them only after they understand their own learning strengths 
and weaknesses. She discusses common academic and emotional difficulties 
and then goes on to offer suggested accommodations. Quinn explains the 
three major sources from which the rights of college students with ADD 
stem: the Constitution, statues and regulations that prohibit discrimination, 
and cases decided by the courts. ADD and the College Student concludes with 
Commonly Asked Questions, which cover medicaiton, treatment programs, 
college admission and SAT's, parent involvement, learning 
accommodations, and legal issues. References to other relevant publications 
and organizations also are provided, as are the definitions of ADHD 
(Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder) used by both the American 
Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
ADD and the College Student is available from MAGINATION PRESS, 19 
Union Square West, New York, NY 10003. (800) 825-3089. The cost is $13.95, 
plus a shipping and handling fee of $2.75.

</p>

<li><p>Approaching College for the Student with ADD is one in a series of videos 
that seeks to inform students with ADD and their parents about the paths to 
success in college. In Approaching College for the Student with ADD, Dr. 
Patricia Quinn dispels the myth that ADD students could do better in school if 
only they tried harder. Quinn argues that many of these students already are 
putting considerable effort into their studies, and that for student with ADD, 
they key to success lies in developing and putting into practice strategies for 
time management, considering medication options, and continuing to seek 
supportive services. In the video, Quinn cautions students that the transition 
from high school and home to college involves enough major changes 
without making a clean break from medication or deciding to "turn over a 
new leaf" by attempting to handle course work without support services. 
Comments from Quinn are augmented by the remarks of several students 
with ADD, whose advice lends a "front  lines" pragmatism to the video. 
These students recount experiences with teachers and administrators and 
offer suggestions for effectively discussing the need for special 
accommodations. </p>

<li><p>In ADD and the College Student, another video in the series, Quinn provides 
a comprehensive list of personality traits associated with attention deficit 
disorder. For someone recently diagnosed with ADD, or for someone who 
suspects the presence of ADD, Quinn's overview of the disability is 
particularly informative. Her description of the disability emphasizes the 
increased tasks and responsibilities of personal care and academic workload 
that are associated with college life. Quinn's assessment provides a positive 
framework for understanding the disability and for developing strategies for 
the college student with ADD. <br><br>
Ann McCormick, an advisor at the American University (Washington, DC), 
follows Dr. Quinn's discussion of symptoms with examples of 
accommodations that her office commonly employs in providing for the 
needs of students with ADD. McCormick provides practical advice on 
choosing a college, and her presentation on accommodations is helpful in 
that it prepares a student with ADD for the kind of dialogue that must take 
place for an effective accommodation program to be developed. This 
discussion includes pragmatic strategies that a student with ADD can employ 
to improve his or her chances of succeeding in a college environment.
The cost of each video is $29.95. To order, prepay the Pediatric Development 
Center, 3262 Arcadia Place, NW, Washington, D.C. 20015. (202) 966-1561.
</p>

<li><p>The ABC's of ADD (1993) is a 30-minute videotape that contains basic 
information for adults with ADD, those who suspect they have ADD, family 
members of individuals with ADD, or any of the many professionals who 
may be interested in the issues associated with adults with ADD. The adult 
focus of the video is conveyed from the start of the tape, which begins with 
snippets of personal stories told by three young adults with ADD and 
segments from various professionals speaking to an audience at an earlier 
conference. <br><br>
Each section is brief, conveying basic information. First, the primary 
symptoms of ADD, including some of the most characteristic symptoms of 
both children and adults with ADD, are discussed. The video expands upon 
this discussion by presenting characteristic secondary symptoms of 
individuals with ADD. Each of the medications most commonly prescribed to 
individuals with ADD is discussed briefly and some of the common side-
effects of the various medications are mentioned. The young adults with 
ADD who appeared at the beginning of the video tell longer versions of their 
own personal stories, touching on issues associated with postsecondary 
education and employment. Common characteristics of adults with ADD also 
are presented in a personal story format. A section on legal rights concludes 
the tape, briefly laying a foundation for understanding the legislation that has 
helped prevent discrimination against individuals with disabilities.
The ABC's of ADD is available from JKL Communications, P.O. Box 41057, 
Washington, DC 20016. The cost is $29.

<h2>Students with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)</h2>

</center>
<p>
The HEATH Resource Center has recently received a number of requests for 
information on issues associated with postsecondary education for 
individuals with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).  In order to collect 
information on this emerging topic, the HEATH staff contacted Chesapeake 
Psychological Services, one of several Washington, DC metropolitan area 
resources offering comprehensive testing and follow-up support to 
individuals with varying types of disabilities.  Chesapeake Psychological 
Services has an Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Clinic, which offers 
a full range of treatment services - from educational recommendations to 
consultation with physicians. As a result of that contact, Dr. Susan Biggs and 
Dr. Kathleen Nadeau on staff at Chesapeake Psychological Services accepted 
the invitation to present a professional development program to the 
members of  the Nation's Capital Area Disability Support Services Coalition.  
What follows is a summary of the Biggs-Nadeau presentation in December 
1992. </p>

<H3>Defining ADD</H3>
<p>
The basic characteristics of adults with ADD include inattention and 
impulsivity.  Adults with ADD may be disorganized, may lose things 
frequently, and may be easily distracted from the task-at-hand.  Impulsiveness  may include a perceived need to move on immediately to a new task, thus  leaving another unfinished (they may be enthusiastic beginners but poor  completers); impatience in waiting situations, such as in stalled traffic or  standing in a slow-moving line;  a short temper; or the tendency to respond  poorly to stress and thus become easily hassled. </p>

<p>The education community divides ADD, by definition, into two similar yet 
slightly different groups.  Individuals may be defined as having either ADD 
- Attention Deficit Disorder, or ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder, or attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity.  Adults with ADD 
or ADHD may be either slow and lethargic, or restless and fidgety.  Medical 
researchers now believe that differences in chemistry in the parts of the brain  which control inhibition may cause ADD, and may be inherited.</p>  

<H3>Historical Trends</H3>
<p>Medical and educational researchers over the past century have addressed 
various aspects of attention-related disability.  In the early 1900's,  attention- related patterns and behavior problems following brain injury were the focus  of research.  During the 1930's and 1940's, attention-related characteristics  among individuals who had not sustained brain injury or brain damage were  recognized and studied.  Our knowledge became much more defined in the  1960's, with the awareness of some of the components that play a part in an attention-related disability, such as learning disabilities, neurologic dysfunction, or behavioral symptoms.  More precision regarding the 
definition of behavioral characteristics became possible in the 1970's.  Finally,  in the 1980's, the definition of ADD was included in the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of the Mental Disorders (DSM-III).  The DSM-III is the 
official glossary of descriptions of mental health diagnosis.  The addition of 
ADD to the DSM-III led to wide recognition of it as a specific disorder.
</p>

<H3>ADD and Adults</H3>
<p>
It is becoming clear that ADD is not a disability limited to childhood or 
adolescence.  More and more adults are discovering that they have ADD; 
current estimates are that between eight and 15 million American adults 
have the disability.  It is a high frequency and low visibility disability, 
meaning that many individuals have the disability, but its characteristics are 
not readily apparent. </p>
<p>
Some report that between one-third and one-half of children with ADD grow 
up to be adults with ADD.  While adults may be more likely to have an 
attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity, the adult will likely continue 
to experience difficulties with concentration; achieving his or her potential; 
impulsivity; behavior problems at home, school, or work; or will use poor 
judgment or have self-destructive tendencies.  Adults with ADD often 
present additional diagnoses as well, such as mild chronic depression, mood 
and energy swings, nervousness, sleep disorders, muscular tension, and/or 
learning disabilities. </p>

<p>The presence within a person of an ADD is pervasive.  It is more likely to 
affect many, or all, of an individual's life areas, rather than just one isolated 
area.  As a result, adults with ADD may experience difficulties with most life 
issues.  Some adults may be unable to complete formal education or may do 
so only with overwhelming drive.  Others may have trouble with 
interpersonal relationships.  Career problems may be present for others with 
ADD.  Career-related problems may stem from frequent job terminations 
because of poor job performance, attention and/or organization problems, 
interpersonal problems with supervisors and/or co-workers, or becoming 
easily bored and quitting a job.  Regardless of the life area in which  an adult 
with ADD is experiencing difficulties, each is likely to feel that he or she is not 
living up to his or her potential.  For relief, some may turn to intense 
physical or mental activity; others may use drugs or alcohol for self-
medication.
</p>

<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
<p>Psycho-educational  diagnosticians use a system similar to the six steps 
described below when evaluating for ADD or ADHD. </p>
  
<ol><li><h4>Understanding Current Concerns and History</h4> 
<p>Diagnosticians interview the student, and possibly his or her family in order 
to garner as much information as possible.  Given the field's emerging 
knowledge about heredity and ADD, a diagnostician may look for clues to 
indicate if characteristics were present early in an individual's life, regardless 
of whether or not the individual and/or his or her family were identified as 
having any of the characteristics of this disability. </p>

<p>Some diagnosticians develop a questionnaire, such as one described by Biggs 
and Nadeau, during this phase of the evaluation process to elicit information 
about ADD or ADHD.  Such questions as "Do you feel that you are 
organized?", or "Would you describe for me your method of organization?" 
begin to provide diagnosticians with useful insights.  Throughout the 
individual's responses, the diagnostician looks for evidence that ADD 
characteristics seem to be present in situations both in and out of the school 
or campus environment.  Questions are asked to discover the areas affected by 
ADD including reading and writing skills, mathematics, attention and 
concentration abilities, language processing, visual and spatial abilities, 
memory, processing speed, social skills, and general concerns. </p>

<li><h4>Selecting Appropriate Measures to Address Concerns</h4>

will produce information about the possibilities of ADD or ADHD, learning 
disabilities, emotional problems, and/or neurological issues. </p>

accommodations, and legal issues. References to other relevant publications 
and organizations also are provided, as are the definitions of ADHD 
(Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder) used by both the American 
Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
ADD and the College Student is available from MAGINATION PRESS, 19 
Union Square West, New York, NY 10003. (800) 825-3089. The cost is $13.95, 
plus a shipping and handling fee of $2.75.

<li><p>Approaching College for the Student with ADD is one in a series of videos 
that seeks to inform students with ADD and their parents about the paths to 
success in college. In Approaching College for the Student with ADD, Dr. 
Patricia Quinn dispels the myth that ADD students could do better in school if 
only they tried harder. Quinn argues that many of these students already are 
putting considerable effort into their studies, and that for student with ADD, 
they key to success lies in developing and putting into practice strategies for 
time management, considering medication options, and continuing to seek 
supportive services. In the video, Quinn cautions students that the transition 
from high school and home to college involves enough major changes 
without making a clean break from medication or deciding to "turn over a 
new leaf" by attempting to handle course work without support services. 
Comments from Quinn are augmented by the remarks of several students 
with ADD, whose advice lends a "front  lines" pragmatism to the video. 
These students recount experiences with teachers and administrators and 
offer suggestions for effectively discussing the need for special 
accommodations. </p>

<li><p>In ADD and the College Student, another video in the series, Quinn provides 
a comprehensive list of personality traits associated with attention deficit 
disorder. For someone recently diagnosed with ADD, or for someone who 
suspects the presence of ADD, Quinn's overview of the disability is 
particularly informative. Her description of the disability emphasizes the 
increased tasks and responsibilities of personal care and academic workload 
that are associated with college life. Quinn's assessment provides a positive 
framework for understanding the disability and for developing strategies for 
the college student with ADD. <br><br>
Ann McCormick, an advisor at the American University (Washington, DC), 
follows Dr. Quinn's discussion of symptoms with examples of 
accommodations that her office commonly employs in providing for the 
needs of students with ADD. McCormick provides practical advice on 
choosing a college, and her presentation on accommodations is helpful in 
that it prepares a student with ADD for the kind of dialogue that must take 
place for an effective accommodation program to be developed. This 
discussion includes pragmatic strategies that a student with ADD can employ 
to improve his or her chances of succeeding in a college environment.
The cost of each video is $29.95. To order, prepay the Pediatric Development 
Center, 3262 Arcadia Place, NW, Washington, D.C. 20015. (202) 966-1561.
</p>

<li><p>The ABC's of ADD (1993) is a 30-minute videotape that contains basic 
information for adults with ADD, those who suspect they have ADD, family 
members of individuals with ADD, or any of the many professionals who 
may be interested in the issues associated with adults with ADD. The adult 
focus of the video is conveyed from the start of the tape, which begins with 
snippets of personal stories told by three young adults with ADD and 
segments from various professionals speaking to an audience at an earlier 
conference. <br><br>
Each section is brief, conveying basic information. First, the primary 
symptoms of ADD, including some of the most characteristic symptoms of 
both children and adults with ADD, are discussed. The video expands upon 
this discussion by presenting characteristic secondary symptoms of 
individuals with ADD. Each of the medications most commonly prescribed to 
individuals with ADD is discussed briefly and some of the common side-
effects of the various medications are mentioned. The young adults with 
ADD who appeared at the beginning of the video tell longer versions of their 
own personal stories, touching on issues associated with postsecondary 
education and employment. Common characteristics of adults with ADD also 
are presented in a personal story format. A section on legal rights concludes 
the tape, briefly laying a foundation for understanding the legislation that has 
helped prevent discrimination against individuals with disabilities.
The ABC's of ADD is available from JKL Communications, P.O. Box 41057, 
Washington, DC 20016. The cost is $29.

<P>     Kids all across the country have opinions about bike
helmets.  Some kids wear them.  Others don't.  And many kids have
ideas on how to get others to wear bike helmets more often.</P>

<P>     We asked 282 kids, ages 8 to 13, from schools in
Pennsylvania, Florida, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Mexico, New York,
Nebraska, and Washington, just what they thought about bike
helmets.</P>

<P>Look what they had to say!</P>

<a name="Crash"></a>
<H3>What Could Happen If You Were Had a Bike Crash and
Weren't Wearing a Helmet?</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>"You could be paralyzed, killed, or you could suffer damage."
	<LI>"You could bust your head open on the sidewalk or a rock."
	<LI>"You could go into a coma."
	<LI>"You could break your neck or crack your head."
	<LI>"You could have serious brain damage and you might have to
	     learn all you know over again."
</UL>

<H4>FACTS</H4>

<P>     You may think you're a pretty good biker, but crashes happen
all the time to very good riders.  In fact:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>    Wearing a bike helmet is the single most important thing you
     can do to protect your brain - and your life - when you ride
     your bike.
     
<LI>    Children between ages 5 and 14 have the highest rate of
     injury of all bicycle riders.
     
<LI>    Each year, more than 500,000 children go to hospital
     emergency rooms or doctors' offices due to bicycle injuries.
     
<LI>    More than half of these collisions happen on neighborhood
     streets, sidewalks, or playgrounds.
</UL>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>

<a name="Wearing"></a>
<H3>Why Do You Wear a Bike Helmet?</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>    "I wear a helmet because I had an accident and I was wearing
     a helmet and my head felt fine."
<LI>    "Because it looks cool and it keeps my head safe."
<LI>    "Because I don't want to hurt my head like my cousin (who
    almost died in a bike accident)."
<LI>    "I wear my helmet most of the time because there is law
     about helmets."
<LI>    "I wear my helmet all the time because 1) my parents make me
     and 2) I don't want to get any head injuries."
<LI>    "You should always wear them because they keep you and your
     brain safe."
</UL>

<H4>FACTS</H4>
<P>     Nationally, only about 15 percent of all kids wear bike
helmets.  In this AAA survey of school children, here's how often
kids wore bike helmets:</P>

     
<TABLE>
<TR>
	<TD>
	Always or most of the time .......................... 
	</TD>
	<TD>
	43%

	<TD>

	</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


<P>     Helmet usage of the surveyed kids is better than the
national average.  Even so, more than half of the children
surveyed don't wear bike helmets most of the time.  This means
lots of these kids could be injured riding bikes.</P>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>

<a name="Others"></a>
<H3>What Would Get Your Best Find to Wear a Bike Helmet More Often?</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>    "You could make a commercial with a famous person wearing a
     helmet and kids could use them as role modes."
<LI>    "Put baseball, football and race driver numbers and names on
     helmets.
<LI>    "Show pros wearing helmets and being cool."
<LI>    "Put extra padding inside of it to make it more
     comfortable."
<LI>    "Put little compartments on the helmets"
<LI>    "Make helmets for girls with ponytails."
<LI>    "You could have a bike-a-thon to encourage kids to wear
     helmets."
<LI>    "If you wear one, you get a free pizza.
<LI>    "Tell them it's the law and if they don't they will have to
     eat spinach."
<LI>    "Have kids who wouldn't wear helmets and got in serious
     collisions go and talk to other kids who won't wear
     helmets."
<LI>    "Tell them to watch the hazards on the news of kids who
     don't wear a helmet."
</UL>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>


<a name="Save"></a>
<H3>What You Can Do To Help Save Lives</H3>

<UL TYPE=DIS>
<LI>    Always wear your bike helmet - and make sure your brothers
     and sisters do, too.
<LI>    Make a deal with your best friend to always wear your
     helmets when you ride together.
<LI>    Talk to your parents or teachers to help organize projects
     with your school, safety patrol, Scout troop, religious
     organization, or other group that will encourage kids to
     wear bike helmets.
<LI>    Ask local businesses to sell bikes only with bike helmets or
     set up bike-helmet giveaway or discount-coupon programs.
</UL>
                               

<P>Ten tips for safe bike riding:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>Always wear a bike helmet.
	<LI>Stop and check traffic before riding into a street.
	<LI>Don't ride at night.
	<LI>Obey traffic signs and signals.
	<LI>Ride on the right-hand side of the street.
	<LI>Check your brakes before riding.
	<LI>Give cars and pedestrians the right-of-way.
	<LI>Wear light or bright-colored clothing so that motorists can
	     see you.
	<LI>Be extra careful turning left - motorists don't expect it.
	<LI>Avoid broken pavement, loose gravel and leaves - which can
     cause you to lose control of your bike.
</OL>

<H2>More About... <br>
Thinkin' Things Collection 3 </H2> 	  

<H3>Fripple Logic</H3>
<p> Kids who are growing up with the Thinkin' Things series will be pleased to know that the Fripples are back.  These colorful, doodle-like critters need help finding their way home.  And working with as few as one written clue and two or three "thought balloons," kids have to solve the logic problems posed by the clues.</p> 

<H3>Trading Tricks</H3>
<p> Stocktopus poses another kind of logic puzzle:  how best to trade such "commodities" as pennies, light bulbs, keys, soccer balls and the like in order to build a particular kind of "portfolio."  At first, it's obvious which swaps will net the items kids need.  But as the difficulty level increases, kids find that they need to map out a whole sequence of trades - including items that they may not need in the end!</p> 

<H3>Programming Fun</H3>
<p> By challenging kids to create a half-time show with their choice of marching bands, cheerleaders and football players, Half Time introduces the concepts of computer programming.  Kids design the formations and link a wide variety of programming codes - represented visually as puzzle pieces - to set them in motion. (In addition to the usual directional commands there are some silly, kid-pleasing ones that make the half-time characters do fun routines.)</p>

<H3>Special Effects</H3>
<p> Photo Twister is a visual playground where kids can distort photographs with 22 special-effects tool or try to duplicate a sequence of effects created by the computer.  What's to learn here?  Try it yourself, and you'll see there's a lot more than just doodling going on! To succeed, it takes an eye for patterns and sequences, deductive reasoning and a willingness to experiment.</p>

<H3>Virtual Physics</H3>
<p> Carving Blox is a "virtual" discovery zone where kids gain hands-on understanding of gravity, friction, motion and inertia.  The idea is to set balls in motion on a sheet of metal by carving channels, adding ramps, tilting the surface, squirting oil and the like.   At first, kids use the tools just to see what happens.  Later on, they start trying to create particular events.  And as with all the activities in this product, it's harder than it looks!</p>

<H2>More About...
<br>With Open Eyes</H2> 	  

<H3>Art Explorations and Projects</H3>

<p><EM>With Open Eyes</EM> offers several ways for children to explore and interact with the art.  Clicking on the clock icon presents the artworks in a timeline.  Or by clicking on the globe, kids can take a geographical tour, continent by continent.  Kids can snap pictures of their favorite pieces and create a slide show focused on a theme.  This option makes With Open Eyes an excellent complement to classroom studies: If your child is studying ancient civilization or African cultures, for example, consider suggesting that she create a scrapbook of art from that time period or continent.</p>  

<p>The images in <EM>With Open Eyes</EM> can inspire creative projects off the computer as well.  Encourage kids to choose a work of art they like and write a story about it.  See what happens when they try to imitate the piece with their own art materials.  Or for older kids, try this activity.
</p>

<H3>Masterpiece Challenge (developed expressly for KidSource)</H3>

<p>The challenge is to recreate a famous work of art, using only the tools found in whichever kids' art program you happen to own.  (Sounds straightforward, but try it yourself first and you'll see it's incredibly challenging!)   Once they've selected a painting, kids can set about discovering the effects created by each tool in their program and how to combine them to replicate the artist's colors, brush strokes and other techniques.  (Can they duplicate a Van Gogh brush stroke with the Kid Pix Wacky brush?  The spattered dots of Seurat with Flying Color's airbrush tool?)</p>

<p>Try setting a time limit for friends who are competing with each other to see who comes closest to the original.  Then have them print and compare the results, exchange disks in school or e-mail their files.  Variations on this creative venture for older kids include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Altering, rather than replicating, a work of art (creating Brown Boy instead of Blue Boy, for example)

<li>Applying one painter's technique to another painter's masterpiece (how would Seurat have painted Starry Night?)

<li>Painting the same masterpiece with two different art programs

</ul>

To make things easier for younger kids, let them paint over a line drawing or a scanned image of a work of art. 

<H3>What's Missing?</H3>

<p>Unlike my kids, I wanted more of a context for viewing the art in the CD-ROM.  With 200,000 works of art, how did The Art Institute choose the 200 for this program?  The Institute missed an opportunity for a bit of subtle publicity:  a short introduction to the Museum, its history and its collection would have been a nice option for adults and older kids.</p>

<p>HEATH provides the following as a service to readers who write 
papers, present conference sessions, apply for funds, address public 
policy makers, and otherwise need to "make a case" concerning the 
education after high school of students with disabilities.  You may 
quote exactly what is stated here and cite the sources as noted under 
the facts, or obtain the sources and select the statistics you need.  
Readers are welcome to call HEATH and talk about these data to

<H3>College Freshmen with Disabilities</H3>

<ul>
<li>The percentage of first-time, full-time freshmen reporting 
disabilities has increased significantly since the later 1970s.  In 1991, 
8.8 percent of all freshmen reported having some types of disability, 
compared with 2.6 percent in 1978.

<li>Sight and learning disabilities were identified most frequently 
by freshmen with disabilities in 1991, with about 25 percent 
reporting each type.  (Chart not available in on-line version)

<li>The proportion of freshmen with disabilities citing learning 
disabilities increased from 15 percent in 1985 to 25 percent in 1991.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities were more likely to be male and 
older than non-disabled students.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities expected to take longer than the 
normal time to complete their degrees and were more likely to select 
a college based on its special program offerings.

<li>Women were more likely than men to have sight and health-related disabilities and need math and science tutoring.

<li>Freshmen with orthopedic disabilities tended to be older than 
other disabled students and more likely to have finished high school 
some years before entering college or to have passed the GED exam.

<li>Freshmen with learning disabilities were most likely to be 
enrolled in two-year campuses (59 percent), while another two-fifths 
(40 percent) were enrolled at universities and four-year colleges.  
One percent were enrolled at historically black colleges and 
universities.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities who were enrolled in historically 
black colleges and universities were more likely to report being blind 
or partially sighted, or having a health related disability.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities were more likely to come from 
lower-income families and less likely to have received financial 
assistance from their families than non-disabled students.  In 
addition, disabled freshmen were less likely to contribute savings  
from summer work the previous summer.  Both disabled and non-
disabled received help from federal financial aid programs, private 
grants, and institutionally financed college loans.

<li>Across most major fields of study, disabled and other students 
expressed similar expectations.  Where they differed: students with 
disabilities were more interested in technical fields than their non-
disabled peers and less interested in being business majors.

</ul>

<H3>Basis of exit for high school students, 1989-90</H3>

<ul>
<li>Over 220,000 students with disabilities left the special 
education system in 1989-90.

<li>More than four in ten students with disabilities, age 14 or 
older, graduated from high school with a diploma.

<li>More than one in ten students with disabilities, age 14 or 
older, graduated from high school with a certificate.

<li>One quarter of the students with disabilities, age 14 or older, 
dropped out of high school before completion.

<li>Students with specific learning disabilities represent the 
largest (129,000) number of the "exiting" population.  Slightly more 
than half of them (52%) were reported to have earned diplomas.  
Other groups in which more than half of the departing students 
obtained diplomas were those with visual impairment (61%), deaf-
blindness (61%), hearing impairment (59%), and orthopedic 
impairment (58%)

<H3>National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education 
Students</H3>

<p>The following data are taken from the National Longitudinal 
Transition Study of Special Education Students, conducted by SRI 
International under contract with the Office of Special Education 
Programs within the U.S. Department of Education.  The SRI data are 
based on a sample of over 8,000 special education students aged 13 
to 23 between the years 1987 to 1989.  Data was first collected in 
1987 from parent interviews, contacts with educators, and 
information from the students' school records.  Data collection was 
repeated in 1990 to track changes in experiences over time.  The 
data below highlight some of the changes in the area of participation 
in postsecondary education. </p>

<H4>Postsecondary education participation </H4>

<ul>
<li>Within the first two years after exiting high school, 15% of students 
with disabilities had attended postsecondary school during the 
preceding year; three to five years after leaving school, 27% of 
students with disabilities had ever attended postsecondary 
education.

<li> Comparatively, two years after leaving school, 56% of students 
without disabilities had attended postsecondary school during the 
preceding year; three to five years after leaving school, 68% of 
students with disabilities had ever attended postsecondary 
education.

<li>Thus, many disabled and non-disabled students alike who did not 
enroll in postsecondary education immediately after high school, do 
attend at a future date.  For both students with and without 
disabilities, enrollment rates are 12% higher three to five years after 
high school than they were two years after high school.  Students 
with disabilities are almost twice as likely to enroll in postsecondary 
education three to five years after high school as they are two years 
after high school.  However, there is still a gap in enrollment rates 
between students with disabilities and students without disabilities; 
at both time intervals, students with disabilities enroll in 
postsecondary education at significantly lower rates than do students 
without disabilities.
</ul>

<H4>Enrollment trends by disability category</H4>

<ul>
<li>Among the different disability categories, there is a great deal of 
variation in postsecondary education participation rates.  

<li>Two years after leaving high school, the participation rates for 
students who are deaf were the highest (36.4); the next largest rates 
were for students with speech impairments (34.0); and students with 
visual impairments (33.0).

<li>Three to five years after leaving high school, the participation rates 
in postsecondary education were the highest for students who are 
hard of hearing (60.4); the next highest rates were for students who 
are deaf (60.0); and students with visual impairments (57.0).

<li>Of all students with disabilities, students with sensory impairments 
attend postsecondary education at rates most similar to students 
without disabilities.
</ul>

<h2>Students with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)</h2>
<h3>Courtesy of <br>
<a href="/heath/index.html">HEATH Resource Center</a> </h3>
</center>
<p>
The HEATH Resource Center has recently received a number of requests for 
information on issues associated with postsecondary education for 
individuals with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).  In order to collect 
information on this emerging topic, the HEATH staff contacted Chesapeake 
Psychological Services, one of several Washington, DC metropolitan area 
resources offering comprehensive testing and follow-up support to 
individuals with varying types of disabilities.  Chesapeake Psychological 
Services has an Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Clinic, which offers 
a full range of treatment services - from educational recommendations to 
consultation with physicians. As a result of that contact, Dr. Susan Biggs and 
Dr. Kathleen Nadeau on staff at Chesapeake Psychological Services accepted 
the invitation to present a professional development program to the 
members of  the Nation's Capital Area Disability Support Services Coalition.  
What follows is a summary of the Biggs-Nadeau presentation in December 
1992. </p>

<H3>Defining ADD</H3>
<p>
The basic characteristics of adults with ADD include inattention and 
impulsivity.  Adults with ADD may be disorganized, may lose things 
frequently, and may be easily distracted from the task-at-hand.  Impulsiveness  may include a perceived need to move on immediately to a new task, thus  leaving another unfinished (they may be enthusiastic beginners but poor  completers); impatience in waiting situations, such as in stalled traffic or  standing in a slow-moving line;  a short temper; or the tendency to respond  poorly to stress and thus become easily hassled. </p>

<p>The education community divides ADD, by definition, into two similar yet 
slightly different groups.  Individuals may be defined as having either ADD 
- Attention Deficit Disorder, or ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder, or attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity.  Adults with ADD 
or ADHD may be either slow and lethargic, or restless and fidgety.  Medical 
researchers now believe that differences in chemistry in the parts of the brain  which control inhibition may cause ADD, and may be inherited.</p>  

<H3>Historical Trends</H3>
<p>Medical and educational researchers over the past century have addressed 
various aspects of attention-related disability.  In the early 1900's,  attention- related patterns and behavior problems following brain injury were the focus  of research.  During the 1930's and 1940's, attention-related characteristics  among individuals who had not sustained brain injury or brain damage were  recognized and studied.  Our knowledge became much more defined in the  1960's, with the awareness of some of the components that play a part in an attention-related disability, such as learning disabilities, neurologic dysfunction, or behavioral symptoms.  More precision regarding the 
definition of behavioral characteristics became possible in the 1970's.  Finally,  in the 1980's, the definition of ADD was included in the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of the Mental Disorders (DSM-III).  The DSM-III is the 
official glossary of descriptions of mental health diagnosis.  The addition of 
ADD to the DSM-III led to wide recognition of it as a specific disorder.
</p>

<H3>ADD and Adults</H3>
<p>
It is becoming clear that ADD is not a disability limited to childhood or 
adolescence.  More and more adults are discovering that they have ADD; 
current estimates are that between eight and 15 million American adults 
have the disability.  It is a high frequency and low visibility disability, 
meaning that many individuals have the disability, but its characteristics are 
not readily apparent. </p>
<p>
Some report that between one-third and one-half of children with ADD grow 
up to be adults with ADD.  While adults may be more likely to have an 
attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity, the adult will likely continue 
to experience difficulties with concentration; achieving his or her potential; 
impulsivity; behavior problems at home, school, or work; or will use poor 
judgment or have self-destructive tendencies.  Adults with ADD often 
present additional diagnoses as well, such as mild chronic depression, mood 
and energy swings, nervousness, sleep disorders, muscular tension, and/or 
learning disabilities. </p>

<p>The presence within a person of an ADD is pervasive.  It is more likely to 
affect many, or all, of an individual's life areas, rather than just one isolated 
area.  As a result, adults with ADD may experience difficulties with most life 
issues.  Some adults may be unable to complete formal education or may do 
so only with overwhelming drive.  Others may have trouble with 
interpersonal relationships.  Career problems may be present for others with 
ADD.  Career-related problems may stem from frequent job terminations 
because of poor job performance, attention and/or organization problems, 
interpersonal problems with supervisors and/or co-workers, or becoming 
easily bored and quitting a job.  Regardless of the life area in which  an adult 
with ADD is experiencing difficulties, each is likely to feel that he or she is not 
living up to his or her potential.  For relief, some may turn to intense 
physical or mental activity; others may use drugs or alcohol for self-
medication.
</p>

<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
<p>Psycho-educational  diagnosticians use a system similar to the six steps 
described below when evaluating for ADD or ADHD. </p>
  
<ol><li><h4>Understanding Current Concerns and History</h4> 
<p>Diagnosticians interview the student, and possibly his or her family in order 
to garner as much information as possible.  Given the field's emerging 
knowledge about heredity and ADD, a diagnostician may look for clues to 
indicate if characteristics were present early in an individual's life, regardless 
of whether or not the individual and/or his or her family were identified as 
having any of the characteristics of this disability. </p>

<p>Some diagnosticians develop a questionnaire, such as one described by Biggs 
and Nadeau, during this phase of the evaluation process to elicit information 
about ADD or ADHD.  Such questions as "Do you feel that you are 
organized?", or "Would you describe for me your method of organization?" 
begin to provide diagnosticians with useful insights.  Throughout the 
individual's responses, the diagnostician looks for evidence that ADD 
characteristics seem to be present in situations both in and out of the school 
or campus environment.  Questions are asked to discover the areas affected by 
ADD including reading and writing skills, mathematics, attention and 
concentration abilities, language processing, visual and spatial abilities, 
memory, processing speed, social skills, and general concerns. </p>

<li><h4>Selecting Appropriate Measures to Address Concerns</h4>
<p>Diagnosticians select tests from a large inventory of assessment tools.  The  selection is based on questions raised from the client's history.  For example,  during the evaluation process, a diagnostician may administer tests which 
will produce information about the possibilities of ADD or ADHD, learning 
disabilities, emotional problems, and/or neurological issues. </p>

<li><h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
Since each individual is unique, there is no pre-determined number of tests 
that a psychlogist or psychiatrist may administer in order to assess for ADD or 
ADHD.  
The assessments usually cover the following areas: intelligence, 
cognitive/information processing, personality, and educational - if learning 
disability is suspected. </p>

<li><h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>
During this stage of the evaluation process, the diagnosticians "play 
detective" and "put clues together." </P>
  
<li><h4>Treatment Planning Conference</h4>
<p>
The treatment planning conference always includes the diagnostician and the 
student, but may also include parents, spouse, and/or an educational 
specialist.  In the conference, test results are shared and interpreted and 
recommendations are discussed.  These may include specific 
recommendations to the student regarding study skills, and 
recommendations to the college regarding needed supports and 
accommodations.  It may include recommendations for a medication 
evaluation, for psychological counseling, and/or for tutoring.  School 
placement issues may be discussed if the student is not satisfied with his or 
her current school.  For a working adult, both school and career issues may be 
discussed. </p>

<li><h4>Written Report</h4>
<p>
The diagnostician completes a full written report, including sections that list 
the tests which were given and the scores obtained, the interpretation of those 
scores, and individualized educational recommendations based on the 
students strengths and weaknesses.  Students should review the report 
thoroughly and ask any questions that they may have, or ask for the 
diagnostician to go over the report with them.  Most diagnosticians will 
schedule a follow-up appointment with the student, after he or she has 
received the written report and has had a chance to review it.  It is extremely 
important that the student understand the full contents of the report, as such 
an understanding will help the student advocate for his or her future needs.  
In addition, students should always keep a copy of the report, as well as any 
other relevant information, for their personal reference or future need. </p>
</ul>

<p>Costs of thorough evaluations, such as the six-step process described above, do 
vary and students are encouraged to become familiar with all options 
available to them before making a final choice.  Students should also check 
with their health insurance companies to see if such an evaluation is covered 
under their policy.</p>

<H3>Relevance to Campus Disability Support Services</H3>
<p>College Offices for Disability Support Services are likely to see an increase in 
requests for services for students with ADD or ADHD.  The disability is now 
recognized in the K-12 school system and public awareness about it has been 
raised by popular media. Accommodations commonly provided by colleges 
and universities, based on the student's functional limitations, include 
extending time to complete exams or papers; using notetakers, tutors, or 
organizational supports; carrying reduced courseloads; and preferential 
registration for smaller classes. </p>

<li><p>ADD and the College Student -A Guide for High School and College 
Students with Attention Deficit Disorder (1994), by Patricia O. Quinn, M.D. 
(editor), is a 113-page compilation of user-friendly information. While ADD 
and the College Student begins by stating that it has been written for high 
school juniors and seniors and college students with attention deficit disorder  (ADD), a diverse audience can benefit from the collection of easy-to-read 
practical advice, including adults who suspect that they may have ADD, 
family members of individuals with ADD, postsecondary service providers, 
psychologists, diagnosticians, vocational rehabilitation workers, as well as 
high school teachers and college counselors. <br><br>
The first half of this 12-chapter book answers commonly asked quesitons, lists 
the major symptoms of ADD, and contains a checklist that can be used to help 
evaluate various symptoms, gain self-awareness, and provide guidance 
regarding the necessity of seeking a professional assessment. The 
biochemistry of ADD, medication, and other treatments for ADD also are 
covered. While Dr. Quinn states that she cannot endorse any of the 
alternative therapies at this point in time, she explains the basics of 
biofeedback therapy, self-control or cognitive therapy, and diet and 
megavitamin therapy. How ADD Affects You focuses on the most common 
issues faced by adolescents with ADD, both academic and social, and ends 
with personal commentaries from two college students with ADD. <br><br>

The second half of ADD and the College Student begins with Preparing for 
College: A Mother's Perspective. This personal story concludes with helpful 
hints for college students with ADD and for their parents. The remainder of 
the book leads readers through senior year at high school, college programs, 
and accommodations for students with ADD. The support services that 
postsecondary students with ADD may find helpful are described. Dr. Quinn 
points out that students can best understand which support services may be 
most helpful to them only after they understand their own learning strengths 
and weaknesses. She discusses common academic and emotional difficulties 
and then goes on to offer suggested accommodations. Quinn explains the 
three major sources from which the rights of college students with ADD 
stem: the Constitution, statues and regulations that prohibit discrimination, 
and cases decided by the courts. ADD and the College Student concludes with 
Commonly Asked Questions, which cover medicaiton, treatment programs, 
college admission and SAT's, parent involvement, learning 
accommodations, and legal issues. References to other relevant publications 
and organizations also are provided, as are the definitions of ADHD 
(Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder) used by both the American 
Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
ADD and the College Student is available from MAGINATION PRESS, 19 
Union Square West, New York, NY 10003. (800) 825-3089. The cost is $13.95, 
plus a shipping and handling fee of $2.75.

</p>

<li><p>Approaching College for the Student with ADD is one in a series of videos 
that seeks to inform students with ADD and their parents about the paths to 
success in college. In Approaching College for the Student with ADD, Dr. 
Patricia Quinn dispels the myth that ADD students could do better in school if 
only they tried harder. Quinn argues that many of these students already are 
putting considerable effort into their studies, and that for student with ADD, 
they key to success lies in developing and putting into practice strategies for 
time management, considering medication options, and continuing to seek 
supportive services. In the video, Quinn cautions students that the transition 
from high school and home to college involves enough major changes 
without making a clean break from medication or deciding to "turn over a 
new leaf" by attempting to handle course work without support services. 
Comments from Quinn are augmented by the remarks of several students 
with ADD, whose advice lends a "front  lines" pragmatism to the video. 
These students recount experiences with teachers and administrators and 
offer suggestions for effectively discussing the need for special 
accommodations. </p>

<li><p>In ADD and the College Student, another video in the series, Quinn provides 
a comprehensive list of personality traits associated with attention deficit 
disorder. For someone recently diagnosed with ADD, or for someone who 
suspects the presence of ADD, Quinn's overview of the disability is 
particularly informative. Her description of the disability emphasizes the 
increased tasks and responsibilities of personal care and academic workload 
that are associated with college life. Quinn's assessment provides a positive 
framework for understanding the disability and for developing strategies for 
the college student with ADD. <br><br>
Ann McCormick, an advisor at the American University (Washington, DC), 
follows Dr. Quinn's discussion of symptoms with examples of 
accommodations that her office commonly employs in providing for the 
needs of students with ADD. McCormick provides practical advice on 
choosing a college, and her presentation on accommodations is helpful in 
that it prepares a student with ADD for the kind of dialogue that must take 
place for an effective accommodation program to be developed. This 
discussion includes pragmatic strategies that a student with ADD can employ 
to improve his or her chances of succeeding in a college environment.
The cost of each video is $29.95. To order, prepay the Pediatric Development 
Center, 3262 Arcadia Place, NW, Washington, D.C. 20015. (202) 966-1561.
</p>

<li><p>The ABC's of ADD (1993) is a 30-minute videotape that contains basic 
information for adults with ADD, those who suspect they have ADD, family 
members of individuals with ADD, or any of the many professionals who 
may be interested in the issues associated with adults with ADD. The adult 
focus of the video is conveyed from the start of the tape, which begins with 
snippets of personal stories told by three young adults with ADD and 
segments from various professionals speaking to an audience at an earlier 
conference. <br><br>
Each section is brief, conveying basic information. First, the primary 
symptoms of ADD, including some of the most characteristic symptoms of 
both children and adults with ADD, are discussed. The video expands upon 
this discussion by presenting characteristic secondary symptoms of 
individuals with ADD. Each of the medications most commonly prescribed to 
individuals with ADD is discussed briefly and some of the common side-
effects of the various medications are mentioned. The young adults with 
ADD who appeared at the beginning of the video tell longer versions of their 
own personal stories, touching on issues associated with postsecondary 
education and employment. Common characteristics of adults with ADD also 
are presented in a personal story format. A section on legal rights concludes 
the tape, briefly laying a foundation for understanding the legislation that has 
helped prevent discrimination against individuals with disabilities.
The ABC's of ADD is available from JKL Communications, P.O. Box 41057, 
Washington, DC 20016. The cost is $29.

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>     Most parents will agree that it is a wonderful experience
to cuddle up with their child and a good book. Few people will
say that about flash cards or pages of math problems. For that
reason, we have prepared this booklet to offer some math
activities that are meaningful as well as fun. You might want
to try doing some of them to help your child explore
relationships, solve problems, and see math in a positive
light. These activities use materials that are easy to find.
They have been planned so you and your child might see that
math is not just work we do at school but, rather, a part of
life.</P>

<P>     It is important for-home and school to join hands. By
fostering a positive attitude about math at home, we can help
our children learn math at school.</P>


<H3>It's Everywhere! It's Everywhere!</H3>


<P>     Math is everywhere and yet, we may not recognize it
because it doesn't look like the math we did in school. Math in
the world around us sometimes seems invisible. But math is
present in our world all the time--in the workplace, in our
homes, and in life in general.</P>

<P>     You may be asking yourself, "How is math everywhere in my
life? I'm not an engineer or an accountant or a computer
expert!" Math is in your life from the time you wake until the
time you go to sleep. You are using math each time you set your
alarm, buy groceries, mix a baby's formula, keep score or time
at an athletic event, wallpaper a room, decide what type of
tennis shoe to buy, or wrap a present. Have you ever asked
yourself, "Did I get the correct change?" or "Do I have enough
gasoline to drive 20 miles?" or "Do I have enough juice to fill
all my children's thermoses for lunch?" or "Do I have enough
bread for the week?" Math is all this and much, much more.</P>


<H3>How Do You Feel About Math?</H3>


<P>     How do you feel about math? Your feelings will have an
impact on how your children think about math and themselves as
mathematicians. Take a few minutes to answer these questions:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>   Did you like math in school?
	
	<LI>  Do you think anyone can learn math?
	
	<LI> Do you think of math as useful in everyday life?
	
	<LI>  Do you believe that most jobs today require math skills?

</UL>

<P>     If you answer "yes" to most of these questions, then you
are probably encouraging your child to think mathematically.
This book contains some ideas that will help reinforce these
positive attitudes about math.</P>


<H3>You Can Do It!</H3>


<P>     If you feel uncomfortable about math, here are some ideas
to think about.</P>

<P>     Math is a very important skill, one which we will all need
for the future in our technological world. It is important for
you to encourage your children to think of themselves as
mathematicians who can reason and solve problems.</P>

<P>     Math is a subject for all people. Math is not a subject
that men can do better than women. Males and females have
equally strong potential in math.</P>

 

<P>     People in the fine arts also need math. They need math not
only to survive in the world, but each of their areas of
specialty requires an in-depth understanding of some math, from
something as obvious as the size of a canvas, to the beats in
music, to the number of seats in an audience, to
computer-generated artwork.</P>

<P>     Calculators and computers require us to be equally strong
in math. Theft presence does not mean there is less need for
knowing math. Calculators demand that people have strong mental
math skills--that they can do math in their heads. A calculator
is only as accurate as the person putting in the numbers. It
can compute; it cannot think! Therefore, we must be the
thinkers. We must know what answers are reasonable and what
answers are outrageously large or small.</P>

<P>     Positive attitudes about math are important for our
country. The United States is the only advanced industrial
nation where people are quick to admit that "I am not good in
math." We need to change this attitude, because mathematicians
are a key to our future.</P>

<P>     The workplace is rapidly changing. No longer do people
need only the computational skills they once needed in the
1940s. Now workers need to be able to estimate, to communicate
mathematically, and to reason within a mathematical context.
Because our world is so technologically oriented, employees
need to have quick reasoning and problem-solving skills and the
capability to solve problems together. The work force will need
to be confident in math.</P>

 

<H3>Build Your Self-Confidence!</H3>


<P>     To be mathematically confident means to realize the
importance of mathematics and feel capable of learning to</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>  Use mathematics with ease;

	<LI>  Solve problems and work with others to do so;<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>   Demonstrate strong reasoning ability;<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>  See more than one way to approach a problem;<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>   Apply mathematical ideas to other situations; and<BR><BR>

	<LI>   Use technology.<BR><BR>

<P>More than any other disability, learning disability (LD) dominates 
discussions with HEATH staff on the telephone and through mail 
inquiries. There is increasing interest in students with LD who attend 
selective colleges and universities, as well as graduating seniors, in 
many types of colleges, who are eager to continue on to graduate 
school or one of the professions (law, medicine, business). The 
following case study and remarks from the field illustrate the range 
of issues involved in the subject.</P>

<a name="A"></a>
<H3>A Case Study</H3>

<P>On admission to a selective independent university in the west, Sally 
identified herself to the Disability Services Offices as someone who 
might need some assistance "because of a vision impairment." An 
able and self-possessed, conscientious student, she had pride in her 
ability to develop strategies for coping; she was not requesting 
services. In the spring of her freshman year, however, sally asked 
tentatively if she could try recorded texts. She reported that her 
sister had a learning disability and used recorded texts. Sally had 
found these helpful during high school, but (she later acknowledged) 
her pride had kept her from investigating whether she too had 
dyslexia as well as partial vision.</P>

<P>Although documentation is usually required before responding to 
such a request. the coordinator agreed to provide readers 
immediately and urged testing for LD. When dyslexia was confirmed 
the recommended accommodations were untimed tests, books on 
tape, and tutorial-all to address the learning disability.
The DSS office, with permission from Sally, called her professors. The 
physics professor was most reluctant to allow untimed tests, and he 
questioned   the whole philosophy of LD accommodations. After some 
discussion, time-and-a-half was agreed upon for the midterm. Sally's 
results were in the top 10 % of the class, causing the professor to 
request an immediate conference because Sally had "obviously 
received unfair advantage" The professor began a resistive process to 
get a faculty committee to back his right to maintain high standards.</P>

<a name="Viewpoints"></a>
<H3>Viewpoints Within the Case</H3>

<H4>Professor of Physics</H4>
<P>This student is in a tough course but should have to compete like 
anyone else; it's an unfair advantage to give extra time. At least part 
of the purpose of a test is to measure the ability to respond speedily; 
if she knew the material she could do so. Why should such students 
be in this university anyway? This is a matter for the Faculty 
Committee on Standards.</P>

<H4>Disability Support Services Staff</H4>
<P>There are many ways to test knowledge of the subject. A person with 
a learning disability has the right to express knowledge in a way that 
acknowledges the difference without changing the standard of 
excellence. The law requires we make the program accessible, which 
includes testing in an accessible manner. This student shows the 
conscientiousness necessary to adapt within reason, and speed does 
not seem a necessary feature of this course. We'll take this to the 
Faculty Senate if necessary.</P>

<H4>Academic Dean</H4>
<P>To make this public in the Senate would probably crystallize the 
controversy; it might turn into a legal issue. Let's try further 
negotiations with the student, professor, and service providers.</P>

<H4>Student</H4>
<P>(Sally did not know of the controversy raging between the DSS Office 
and the Physics Department  At a critical moment before the next 
exam, she happened to be in the DSS office discussing general 
accommodations with the  coordinator. Spontaneously, she asked to 
use the phone and without the prior knowledge of the service 
provider, called the physics professor. Taken by surprise, the 
professor grilled her about why she needed time-and-a-half and how 
she would use it.)</P>

<P>I assume arrangements for the final test will be the same as those 
for the midterm. How would I use the extra time? I need 15 minutes 
at the beginning of the test to read the questions carefully, 
permission to ask you if I have understood the questions, and 20 
minutes at the end to check spelling, number reversals, the way my 
answers are laid out. I would not work on more problems after the 
other students stop.</P>

<H4>The Picture Comes Together</H4>
<P>The calm and logic of the student's responses delighted the service 
provider who overheard the conversation.  Apparently, the professor 
had also begun to observe that Sally did understand the material 
being presented in class. He had taken time to inquire and had 
learned about Sally's high quality work in other courses. The 
professor agreed to the accommodation for the balance of the year, 
and Sally excelled in Physics. He is now fully supportive of the DSS 
office and a ready spokesman for extended time for LD students.</P>

<a name="Views"></a>
<H3>Views from the Field</H3>

<P>(From Robert A. Shaw, Associate Dean Brown University, "Dyslexic 
Students Possess the Characteristics of Self-Awareness and 
Deliberation That Are Hallmarks of a Liberal Education," The 
Chronicle of Higher Education,  September 19, 1990)</P>

<P>No college could avoid accepting dyslexic students even if it 
tried...colleagues report that 75 per cent of dyslexic students (in 
selective institutions) were not identified as such in the admission 
process...Every school in the country already is accepting these 
students and has an obligation to provide a supportive educational 
environment for them.</P>

<P>As a group they also have an unusual degree of perseverance and 
self-awareness. Dyslexics characterized by difficulties in writing, 
reading, and organizing information...More than other students, they 
must make conscious decisions about how to budget their time and 
how to set priorities to achieve their goals. Thus, they come to college 
with skills that are valued in an educational environment.
Addressing the needs of dyslexic students also encourages a 
university to examine and improve it's instructional 
practices...Faculty members (at Brown) welcomed the opportunity to 
discuss pedagogical principles with students in a structured 
setting...Students suggested: ...providing a clear structure for course 
materials and assignments, presenting material in more than one 
mode (e.g. visual as well as aural), monitoring the class to see how 
well students understand the concepts being presented, providing 
opportunities for students to clarify unclear points, and encouraging 
students to develop a personal learning style within the discipline. 
These are, of course, excellent suggestions for teaching any group of 
students."</P>

<B>[From Learning Disabi1ities at Harvard, In Press.]</B><BR>
<P>Although effects are inconsistent, (LD) can interfere with every stage 
of the verbal and non-verbal processes. ..In academic settings, 
students with this disability may be viewed as unintelligent, 
unmotivated, careless, inattentive, unconscientious, easily distracted, 
inconsistent, disorganized or undisciplined....One thing is certain-
learning disabilities are non-discriminatory. They affect all races and 
economic classes...</P>

<B>[From Bonnie Kellerman, Associate Director of Admissions, MIT.]</B><BR>
<P>I find it disturbing to hear that students are being advised not to 
identify themselves in their applications. I think that particularly for 
selective schools, where context is a very important part of the 
admissions decision, knowing that someone has achieved at a certain 
level in spite of some disability. . .would make us look more 
favorably upon that student.</P>

<B>[From Ralph D'Amico Branch Chief, US Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights, Boston.]</B><BR>
<P>The student has the right to self-identify. If you feel that they will 
be treated fairly in the process when they do self-identify, then 
that's fine. I must admit that my experience has not shown me that 
that is the case....Once the student self-identifies [and documents the 
learning disability], the institution would be obligated to provide 
services and consider readmission [in the case of failing out].</P>

<B>[From Kay Runyan, Specialist and Researcher, Office of Disability 
Support Services University of California, Berkeley.]</B><BR>
<P>Empirical research confirms that normally achieving students often 
perform up to their capabilities under timed testing conditions and 
have little room for improvement. Students with learning disabilities 
often cannot perform up to their capabilities under timed conditions 
and show considerable improvement when allowed extra time.</P>

<B>[From Susan Quinby, Director Disability Support Services, Bernard 
College.]</B><BR>
<P>Students must be effective self-advocates with their departments 
and with their professors. They need to develop acceptance of their 
disability and be able to explain which accommodation will enable 
them to do their top work.  A form of counseling to help deal with 
the emotional "baggage" is our new LD Peer Service Team. We pay 
students to come to training on counseling and communication skills, 
so that they can become advocates for themselves and assist new or 
undiagnosed LD students who are "in crisis." [In addition, every fall 
we ask all faculty to make an announcement in each class that 
students with disabilities, visible or invisible, self-identify at the 
earliest possible point [and to] request services from the disabilities 
office. Students have found this to be a very effective bridge, 
especially students with hidden disabilities.</P>

<B>[From William Scales, Director of Disability Support Services, 
University of Maryland, President of AHSSPPE for 1991.]</B><BR>
<P>While we are committed to accommodating students with learning 
disabilities, and we are proud of the success many have achieved, 
there are some emerging issues involved. The number of requests is 
mushrooming, especially for special test administration. We are 
running out of staff time, space, and patience. We have doubts about 
assessment accuracy and lack certainty about matching the 
accommodation to the disability. Whose word do you take? Students 
with learning disabilities are so substantially affected by the 
emotional overlay, by the anxiety about failure, that they are very 
time-consuming to counsel.</P>

<B>[From Molly Sandperl, Acting Director, Disability Support Services, 
Stanford University.]</B><BR>
<P>The cutting edge in serving these students is supporting their career 
search after college or graduate school. We offer guidance to improve 
self-advocacy and prepare for interviews for graduate work or 
employment. My time is "freed up" by hiring competent students as 
staff to coordinate our services: notetakers, interpreters, scribes and 
readers, attendant services, an escort transit system, and the office </P>

<P>Reprint from Information from HEATH   Jan.-Feb. 1991 payroll. Because the University is on the Honor System, we don't 
have the proctoring pressure, and I take the student's word for the 
length of extended time needed."</P>

<B>[From Peter Anderheggen, Acting Director, LD Program, Housatonic 
Community College (CT).]</B><BR>
<P>High achieving LD students should be given some leadership 
responsibility in the program. They should model their study habits 
to other students. I ask students to provide small group sessions with 
one or two others. We have LD students who are high achieving 
academically, and some who are high achieving socially.</P>

<B>[From Nancy Pompian, Director, Academic Skills Center, Dartmouth 
College.]</B><BR>
<P>Learning disabilities or learning weaknesses? When students are 
highly intelligent, well-motivated and hard-working, the curriculum 
itself is ultimately the best diagnostic test. As the law -504-got 
ahead of science, we are still searching for valid diagnostic tests for 
this special population. When learning disabilities aren't severe, we 
need an agreed-upon way of distinguishing them from learning 
weaknesses or differences. We should be testing students in a 
matched random sample to see whether the profiles we're calling 
"LD" are unique to the students who carry that label.</P>

<h3><a name = "Activity">Activities</a></h3>

     There is no one "right" way of doing these activities.
Make changes, shorten or lengthen them to suit your child's
attention span, or think up some activities of your own. Above
all, enjoy them. And don't worry about what you might not have
done in the past. Start where you are now, with the resources
you have now.<br><br>

     In a box at the end of each activity is information on why
that activity is important to your child's education. The
suggested activities all build skills, attitudes, and behaviors
children need for good study habits. They are designed to help
develop personal maturity, enthusiasm for learning, and the
ability to concentrate.<br><br>

     But that does not mean the activities are hard to do and
won't be any fun. They are easy to do, cost little or no money,
use materials found at home, and don't take much time.<br><br>

     Work out your own schedule for the activities. Don't
forget to try them on vacation days or in the summer, too. If
you've only used one part of an activity, you can go back to it
and find the ideas you haven't tried. Experience indicates that
all of the activities, in whole or in part, will be useful.
Ability in schoolwork is like ability in sports: it takes
practice to gain confidence, to become motivated, and to win.<br><br>

<b>Age Levels</b>

<br><br>
     The activities are arranged by approximate age levels.
But, of course, you are the best judge of what your child may
be ready to try. Age levels of the activities are indicated by
a symbol at the top of each activity:<br><br>


<b>Ages 5-7</b>
<br><br>
     The activities for these early school years focus on
helping children get ready for schoolwork and get a head start
on the habits and behaviors important for ongoing success in
school.<br><br>

<b>Ages 7-9</b>

<br><br>
     These activities help children become organized and build
early study skills and work habits.<br><br>

<b>Ages 9-11</b>
<br><br>
     These projects for children in the upper elementary grades
continue to focus on work and study habits, with more emphasis
on making personal decisions.<br><br>

Remember:
<ul>

   <li>We can all be great teachers;

   <li>Every home is a learning place;

   <li>We don't need a lot of time to do a lot of good; and

   <li>Everyone's abilities and skills can be improved.
</ul>

<b>Let's Go</b><br><br>


     Pick an activity and try it with your children. You will
know they are learning when they say, "Let me try it." And
you'll know they understand when they shout: "Let me do it! Let
me! Let me."<BR><BR>

<h4>Can You Top This?</h4>

     Teamwork is important in school. In this game, children
practice taking turns and working with others. They also build
language skills.<br><br>


What you'll need: Imagination
<br><br>
What to do
<ul>

  <li>1. Make up a story, with parents and children taking turns,
     one sentence at a time.<br><br>

     Decide on a topic. You might begin the first sentence with
     "Once upon a time a pirate lived in..."<br><br>

     Continue taking turns making up and telling parts of the
     story until you decide to end it-maybe after 8 or 10
     sentences.<br><br>

  <li>2. Take turns beginning and finishing a story. Ask other
     family members and friends to join in.
</ul>

     By making up stories, children can improve their language
skills. They can also start to understand how ideas flow from
one to another, and that everyone's ideas are important.<br><br>

<a name="Listen"></a>
<b>Listen Up</b>
<br><br>
     This game helps teach how to listen carefully and follow
directions, two things that are important in school.<br><br>

What you'll need<br><br>
<ul>

<li>Any small object you can hide 
<li>Objects that make noise
</ul>
 
What to do<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>1. Hide a small object. Give directions to find it such as,
     "Take five steps ahead. Turn right. Keep the lamp to your
     left. Bend down and look to the right." Take turns doing
     this.

  <li>2. All but one person close their eyes. The person with his 
     or her eyes open makes a sound (such as keys jangling,
     hands clapping, a bell ringing, a spoon tapping against a
     glass). Everyone else tries to guess what is making the
     sound.

  <li>3. Clap your hands to tap out a rhythm. Have another player
     listen and then clap that same rhythm back to you. Do it
     different ways: slow, fast, loud, soft. Make the rhythms
     harder as it gets easier to repeat them.

  <li>4. When taking a walk, or any place where you can stop for a
     few minutes, sit quietly for 30 seconds with your eyes
     closed, then tell each other what you heard: a baby
     crying, an airplane, a bird singing.

  <li>5. Take a walk. One of you tell the other person what to
     do--cross the street, turn left, look down. Take turns
     following each other's directions.
</ul>
<br>
     Through practice, children can learn to listen carefully,
see and hear details, and follow directions.<BR><BR>

<h4>Time Marches On</h4>


     This game will help your children see the difference
between "a few seconds" and "a few minutes," and can help them
be on time in school.
<br><br>
What you'll need

<ul>
<li>Paper 
<li>Pencil
<li>A timer of some kind (alarm clock, kitchen timer)
<li>Clock or watch with all 12 numerals and a second hand
</ul>

<br>What to do<br>
<ul>

  <li>1. Ask your children to watch the second hand tick five
     seconds. Together, count off the seconds.

  <li>2. Count off 30 seconds. How many times can your child clap
     hands during this time? Take turns timing and watching
     each other.

  <li>3. Make guesses about how long ordinary things take:
<ul>
     <li>How long is a traffic light red or green?

     <li>How long does it take to eat dinner?

     <li>How long does it take to get ready for school?

     <li>Test your guesses with the watch or timer. How close did
     you each come to the right answer?
</ul>
  <li>4. Read a book aloud with your child for 3 minutes. Time
     yourselves. Then move up to 5 minutes, then to 10, and so
     on.
</ul>
 Learning that some things take longer than others will
help your child understand how long it takes to do a task and
how to plan for it. This activity will also help them increase
their attention span.<br><br>

<b>Now You See It, Now You Don't</b><br><br>


     This activity teaches children to pay close attention by
seeing how long it takes different kinds of liquids to freeze
and melt.<br><br>

What you'll need<br><br>

<ul>
<li>2 ice cube trays
<li>A clock
<li>Water
<li>Small bowls
<li>Paper
<li>Pencil
<li>Other liquids
</ul>

What to do<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>1. Together, fill one ice cube tray to the top with water.
     Fill the other tray only half full. 
<ul><li> Put both trays in the freezer. Check the clock. In
     2 hours, look to see if the water has frozen (if not,
     wait until it has frozen).

     <li>How long did it take the water in each tray to freeze?

    <li>Did the smaller amount of water freeze faster than the
     larger amount?
</ul>
  <li>2. Take an ice cube from each of the 2 trays. Put them in
     separate bowls to melt. Which cube melts faster--the
     larger one or the smaller one?

  <li>3. Put one ice cube in a window and another in the
     refrigerator (not freezer) and see how long they take to
     melt.

  <li>4. Try to freeze samples of liquids such as fruit juices.
     Compare their freezing times to that of water.
</ul>

     This activity can help your child understand that things
don't happen immediately. It will also introduce the concept of
change--liquid to solid to liquid again--and the idea of having
to wait to get the result you want. <br><br>

<a name="Start"></a>
<b>Start to Finish</b> <br><br>


     Organization has to be learned. This activity lets
children practice planning, beginning, and finishing a
job--important parts of completing schoolwork.<br><br>

What you'll need<br><br>
<ul>

<li>Pencil
<li>Paper
<li>Items used to do a job around the house, such as watering
     plants or setting the table
</ul>

What to do<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>1. Together, select one job your child usually does around
     the house, such as watering plants.
<ul>
     <li>Ask your child to write down or tell you the "Plan," "Do,"
     and "Finish" steps needed to do the job well.

    <li> Look over these steps together and talk about possible
     changes.
</ul>
  <li>2. See what happens if one plant isn't watered when it is
     supposed to be. How long does it take for the leaves to
     start changing color?

  <li>3. List the "plan," "do," and "finish" steps of one or two
     jobs you do around the house. Ask your child to help you
     think of ways to improve these steps.

  <li>4. When your children have a new task, help them plan the
     steps so they can do the job well and have a sense of
     accomplishment.
</ul>

     Sometimes taking time to plan seems like "a waste of
time," but it has been shown that those who plan a job are
usually more successful and do it in a shorter amount of time.
<br><br>
     Seeing the changes from not watering a plant can introduce
the idea of "cause and effect."

<b>I'm OK, We're OK</b><br><br>

     All of us have ways in which we are special. This activity
helps children recognize and appreciate how they, and others,
are special.<br><br>


What you'll need
<ul>

<li>Pen or pencil
<li>Paper
</ul>

What to do<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>1. Together, think of and write down at least 2 things you
     like about yourselves (for example, I have a good sense of
     humor; I try to be fair).
<ul>
     <li>Write down 2 things you like about the others playing this
     game.

     <li>Now, take turns talking about what others say they like
     about you.
</ul>
  <li>2. Write down 2 things you would like to improve. When will
     you start? How long do you think it will take?

  <li>3. Think of some jobs around the house that both of you will
     feel proud of, like fixing special food for the family,
     teaching the family a new game, or fixing something that's
     broken.

  <li>4. Try to set a time every day, even a few minutes, when you
     can talk about things that happened that day.
<ul>
     <li>Find times to listen to each other and to chat. A ride to
     the grocery store or a wait at the dentist's office can be
     a good time.
</ul>
</ul>
     Self-confidence can make a difference in how much success
a person has, both at school and later in life.
<br><br>
     Talking about what happened during the day lets children
work out problems early instead of having them pile up and
become overwhelming.

<b>Where Did I Put That?</b><br><br>


     Children need help getting organized. A special place for
school items helps make mornings smoother for parents and
children.
<br><br>

What you'll need
<ul>

<li>Cardboard box
<li>Crayons or markers
</ul>

What to do<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>1. Find a sturdy cardboard box or carton large enough to hold
     notebooks and other school things. Let your child decorate
     it with pictures, words, or art work, and his or her name.
     Each child in the family can have a separate box.
<ul>
     <li>Together, find a place to put the box. A spot near the
     front door or the place where your child does homework
     would be good.

     <li>School things should go in the box as soon as your child
     comes home from school. Later, all homework and anything
     else needed for school the next day should go into it.

     <li>In the winter, hats and mittens can also go in the box
     when they are dry.
</ul>
  <li>2. Let your child make a rainy day box and put it in a
     different place (or make it a different color). Fill it
     with "treasures"--games, books, a new pencil. Invite other
     members of the family to put surprises in the box (no
     snakes or flogs, please).
</ul>

Keeping all school items in one place helps teach children
how much easier life can be when we are organized and plan
ahead.
<br><br>
     Show your appreciation when your child keeps things in
order.

<a name="My"></a>
<b>My Place</b><Br><br>


     This activity gives each child a separate place to study
or play.<Br><br>


What you'll need<Br><br>

<ul>
<li>Space--even a tiny area will do
<li>A small but steady table
<li>1 chair
<li>1 lamp
<li>Small floor covering
</ul>
What to do<br><br>

<ol>
  <li> Together, find a quiet study area away from the TV and
     radio for each child (even those not old enough to have
     homework yet).

  <li>Cut down an old blanket, rug, or sheet to put on a small
     area of the floor. Use this to mark off each child's
     private space. Put the table and chair on the floor
     covering.
<br><br>
     This space does not have to be in the same place all the
     time. If the table is light weight, the floor cover can be
     put down any place it is out of the way (such as near the
     kitchen if a child needs help while dinner is being
     fixed). It can also be put away when it is not being used.

  <li> If the study space will always be in the same place, try
     out different arrangements of the furniture to see what
     works best. Arrange the lamp so the study area is well
     lit.

  <li> Together, label items with the child's name.
</ol>

     Watch for improvement and show pleasure when quality of
work improves.<br><br>

     Children tend to argue over the same space (even in a big
room). By having an area of the floor marked off, each child
has a place that feels like his or her own. A special place
also helps children focus on what they are studying.<br><br>

<a name="Well"></a>
<b>Well Done!</b><br><br>

     Children need the experience of doing chores. The
following are ideas to help children be more responsible and
realize the importance of people doing what they say they will
do.<br><br>


What you'll need:


Helping hands<br><br>

What to do<br><br>
<ol>

  <li> Talk about what happens when people do the things they are
     responsible for (water the plants or feed pets, for
     example).<br>

     Think about what would happen if people did not do these
     things--if the bus driver stayed home, or the movie
     projectionist didn't show up for work. Together, think of
     more examples.

  <li> Decide together on jobs for each family member to do.
     Should people be able to do only the things they like?
     Talk together about this.

  <li> Turn a household task into a game. Decide together how
     long it will take to do the job. Time yourselves against
     the clock.
<br>
     Listening to the radio or a record while you do the job
     makes it more fun. This helps the work get done faster,
     too.
</ol>

     Children need to learn early how others are affected when
chores-are not done. Talk about why it is necessary to do
things we don't want to do, and why we should not expect others
to do our work.
<br><br>
     This activity also gives children an early lesson in how
to make good decisions.

<b>How Time Flies</b><br><br>


     "I don't have time to do all I need time to do." Sound
familiar? Planning our time is one of the most useful things we
can learn. Knowing how long something will take can save time
and tempers.
<br><br>
What you'll need<br><br>


<ul><li>Paper
<li>Pencil
<li>Clock
<li>Calendar
</ul>

What to do<br><br>


  <ol><li> Together, write down your estimates of how long it takes
     to do certain tasks (such as getting ready for school or
     work in the morning; fixing a meal).
<br>
     Use a clock to time at least one of these tasks. Then take
     turns timing each other. (But be realistic--it's not
     necessarily a race.)

  <li> See what part of a job can be done ahead of time, such as
     deciding at bedtime what to wear the next day.

  <li> Talk about at least 2 places you and your children go
     where you must be on time. What do you do to make sure you
     are on time?

  <li> Put a monthly calendar with large spaces where everyone
     can see it. Each member of the family can use a different
     colored marker to list appointments and social activities.
</ol>
     Being on time, or not being on time, affects other people.
It is important for children to understand their responsibility
for being on time--it's not just for grown-ups.

<a name="Homework"></a>
<b>Homework Made Easy(!)</b><br><br>

     Homework without nagging is much to be desired. Have your
child try a homework chart.
<br><br>

What you'll need<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Paper
<li>Marker, pen, or pencil
<li>Clock
</ul>

What to do<br><br>


  <ol><li> Have (or help) your child do the following: Create a
     homework chart out of a sturdy, large-sized piece of
     paper.
<ul>
     <li>Attach a colored marker or pen so that it is always handy.

     <li>Each day after school, put a check mark in each box in
     which there is a homework assignment.Circle the check when
     the homework is completed.
</ul>
  <li> Make a new chart for each week. Depending on how many
     subjects you have, you may be able to put 3 or 4 weeks on
     each piece of paper.

  <li> Try to figure out how long it will take to complete
     homework assignments so you know when you need to start
     working.
</ol>
     A homework chart can show exactly what needs to be done
when, and gives a feeling of accomplishment when an assignment
is crossed off.
<br><br>
     Talk to your child about homework. Does your child need or
want more time or help? Does your child want to devote more
time to learning about a certain subject?

<a name="Divide"></a>
<b>Divide It Up</b><br><br>

     Just about anything is easier to do if it's divided into
smaller pieces. As assignments get longer and more complicated,
more organizing and planning skills are needed.<br><br>


What you'll need<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Homework assignments
<li>Jobs in and around the house
<li>Paper
<li>Pencil
</ul>

What to do<br><br>

<ol>
  <li> Choose a big assignment to talk about, such as a geography
     project. Decide together, and have your child write down,
     what he or she needs to complete the job. For example:
<ul>
     <li>Reference materials (books, maps)<br>
     Can you complete the assignment just using your textbook?
     If not, do you need to go to the library?. If so, can you
     check out books, or will you have to allow time to stay
     there and use reference books?

    <li> Notes<br>
     Do you have a notebook? Pencils? Will you need note cards?

     <li>Illustrations<br>
     If you need pictures, where will you get them?

    <li> Finished project<br>
     Will it be a stapled report? A poster? A folded brochure?
     What will you need to complete the job?
</ul>
  <li> Decide the order in which the parts of the job need to be
     done. Number the steps.
<br>

     Try to estimate how long each step will take. Work
     backwards from the date the paper is due in order to see
     when each part needs to be started. Put start and finish
     dates next to these steps, then put the assignment on a
     calendar or homework chart.

  <li> Together, think about a household job, such as gardening
     or cleaning. Divide it up into smaller parts.

 <li>  Talk about how adults divide work on their jobs or at
     home.
</ol>
     This trick of dividing big jobs into small pieces helps
make all jobs easier and can save a lot of wear and tear on
everyone when it's time to hand in a school assignment.

<b>Help Wanted</b><br><br>

     Older students are interested in life beyond school. You

What you'll need<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Pen or pencil
<li>Paper
<li>Newspaper "help wanted" ads
<li>Friends and neighbors
</ul>

What to do<br><br>


  <ol><li> Talk with your child: "What job do you think you would
     like to do when you get out of school? What training do
     you think you will need to get this job?"

  <li> Suggest that your child pick two adults he or she knows,
     such as neighbors or relatives, to interview briefly about
     their jobs.

    <ul><li> Help your child think of at least 3 questions to write
     down, leaving space for the answers. Sample questions:
     What is your job? How long have you held it? What kind of
     special training did you need?

     <li>Have your child do the interviews. (You may want to help
     him or her get started.)

     <li>After the interview, talk about what your child learned.
     Now your child will be more comfortable doing the next
     step.
</ul>
  <li> Read a page of the newspaper help wanted ads together.
     Have your child find ads for three jobs that he or she
     might want in the future. Talk together about the training
     needed for each job: Can some of it be learned on the job?
     How much schooling is necessary?.

  <li> Have your child find people who already have these jobs
     and interview them.
</ol>
     Remember that there will be many new kinds of jobs in the
future. What children--and adults, too-need to do is be
flexible and keep on learning.

"How can I help others?"<br><br>


What you'll need
<ul><li>


Newspaper and magazine articles</ul>

What to do<br><br>

<ol>
  <li> Together, find newspaper articles about people who get
     involved. Look for ways to help other people that involve
     your child's interests.

  <li> What are some everyday good deeds? Ask your children to
     think back and remember a time when they helped another
     person. Think big and think small.

  <li> Discuss community food drives and volunteer tutoring
     programs. Suggest that your children check with a local
     religious group, community or recreation center, school,
     or library.

  <li> Explore the possibility of joining a young people's group
     that does community service.

  <li> Ask your children to name at least two things they could
     do today or tomorrow to help others. What will it take?
     Encourage your children to make a commitment.

<li>TV schedule
<li>Pen or pencil

     Decide what you will watch each day or week. Circle your
     choices. If 2 people want to watch different programs at
     the same time, try to compromise: take turns.
<li>
     Your child's teacher may assign a TV program as homework:
     make allowances if this happens.
</ul>
  <li> Try to find time to watch TV with your child. Be sure they
     understand what's real and what isn't.

  <li> Have board games, books, or projects handy so children can
     do other things when TV time is used up.

<b>Q: </b>When should I talk with my child's teacher?<br><br>


     Early and often. Contact the teacher at the beginning of
the year or as soon as you can. Get acquainted and show your
interest.<br><br>

     Let teachers know what they need to know about your child.
If your child has special needs, make these known right from
the beginning.<br><br>

     If you notice a big change in your child's behavior or
attitude, contact the teacher immediately.<br><br>

     The teacher should tell you before the end of a grading
period if your child is having trouble; keeping parents
informed is an important function of the school.<br><br>

     Remember, parents and teachers work together to help
children want to learn and to help them gain self-confidence
and self-discipline.<br><br>

<b>Q: </b> How do I get the most out of parent-teacher conferences?<br><br>


     Be prepared to listen as well as to talk. It helps to
write out questions before you leave home. Also jot down what
you want to tell the teacher. Be prepared to take notes during
the conference and ask for an explanation if you don't
understand something.<br><br>

     In conferences, the teacher should offer specific details
about your child's work and progress. If your child has
already received some grades, ask what went into them. Ask how
your child is being evaluated.<br><br>

     Discuss your child's talents, skills, hobbies, study
habits, and any special sensitivities such as concern about
weight or speech difficulties.<br><br>

     Tell the teacher if you think your child needs special
help. Tell the teacher about any special family situation, such
as a new baby, an illness, or a recent or upcoming move. It is
important to tell the teacher about things in your children's
lives that might affect their ability to learn.<br><br>

     Ask about specific ways to help your child at home. Try to
have an open mind.<br><br>

     At home, think about what the teacher has said and then
follow up. If the teacher has told you your child needs to
improve in certain areas, check back in a few weeks to see how
things are going.<br><br>

     Parents and teachers are partners in helping children.<br><br>


<b>Q: </b>What if I don't have time to volunteer as much as I would
like?<br><br>


     Even if you can't volunteer to do work at the school
building, you can help your child learn when you are at home.
The key question is, "What can every parent do at home, easily
and in a few minutes a day, to reinforce and extend what the
school is doing?" This is the involvement every family can and
must provide.<br><br>

     The schools also need to take steps so parents feel good
about what they're doing at home and know they are helping.<br><br>

     What we as parents need to care about is involving
ourselves in our children's education outside of school.<br><br>

     Remember, you can encourage your child to work hard. You
can give your child the power to succeed in school.<br><br>

<FONT SIZE="+3">W</FONT>hen parents help their children learn to read, they open the
door
to a big, exciting world. As a parent, you can begin an endless
learning chain like this: You read to your children, they develop a
love of stories and poems, they want to read on their own, they
practice reading, and finally, they read for their own information
or pleasure. When children become readers, their world is forever
wider and richer.<P>

Here are some things you can do:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Read aloud to your child: books, newspaper and magazine articles,
the back of the cereal box, labels on cans, or directions.<P>

<LI>Read poems aloud together to learn about rhythm and repeated
sounds in language.<P>

<LI>Point to the words on the page when you read. Move your finger
from left to right.<P>

<LI>Listen to your child read homework or favorite stories to you
every day.<P>

<LI>Go to the library together and check out books. Be sure to ask
the librarian for good books or to help you find what you need.<P>

<LI>Have books, magazines, and papers around the house, and let your
child see that you like to read, too. <P>

<LI>Encourage older children to read to younger children.<P>

<LI>Help experienced readers talk and write about what they read.
</UL><P><P>

<HR SIZE=8>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Reading Activities</H2><P>

<H3>Over and Over Again</H3>
<I>for young children</I><P>

<OL>
<LI>Pick a story or poem that repeats phrases. "Assign" your child a
phrase to repeat each time you read a new part of the story.<P>

<LI>Read a short portion of the story or poem, then stop and let
your child repeat the phrase.<P>

<LI>Encourage your child to act out the story.
</OL><P>

For example, with the story of the "Three Little Pigs:"<P>

<PRE><IMG SRC  = "/images/read2.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Wolf (parent):      Little pig, little pig,
			Let me come in.

<IMG SRC  = "/images/read2.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=RIGHT>
    Little Pig (child): Not by the hair on my 
			chinny-chin-chin!

<IMG SRC  = "/images/read2.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Wolf (parent):      Then I'll huff and I'll 
			puff, and I'll blow 
			your house in!



</PRE><P>

<H3>Make Sense of Sounds </H3>
<I>for beginning readers</I><P>

<OL>
<LI>Look for poems or tongue twisters that repeat sounds and
letters.<P>

<LI>Point out these sounds and letters, and explain that they often
make the same sound whenever you see them with other letters on the
page. For example:

<OL>
<LI>Ask your child to read to you.<P>

<LI>Take turns. You read a paragraph and your child can read the
next one, or take turns reading full pages one after the other.
Keep in mind that your child may be concentrating on how to read,
and your reading helps to keep the story alive.<P>

<LI>If your child has trouble reading words, you can help in several
ways:<P>

<UL>
<LI>have your child skip over the word, read the rest of the
sentence, and ask what word would make sense in the story;

<LI>have your child use what is known about letters and the sounds
they make to "sound out" the word; or

<LI>supply the word and keep reading: enjoyment is the main goal.

     Texas Tech University School of Law maintains one of the largest and most up-to-date
computer networks of any Texas law school.  The network consists of 300 computers, with 220
computers located in student study carrels, 12 computers located in the school computer lab, and
70 computers supporting the law school faculty and staff.  The low student-to-computer ratio (2.5 students per computer) ensures each student has ready access to electronic resources and allows for great freedom in using these resources.  
     The computer network was designed to meet the needs of the students.  The network was planned by careful evaluation of the needs of law students and the technologies used in the legal profession.  A strategic plan was also developed to project a maintenance, upgrade and replacement schedule that will make sure the computer network keeps current and provides quality performance.

<P>
The law school network has direct Internet access via the campus Internet backbone.  This allows very quick access to a world wide network of research sites.  The Internet is accessible through all computers on the law school network. The most current release of the Netscape Internet browser is maintained on the system.

<P>
In addition to various Internet sites, LEXIS-NEXIS&reg; and WESTLAW&reg; legal research services are available through direct Internet connection.  The TTU School of Law pays for student access to the extensive LEXIS-NEXIS&reg; and WESTLAW&reg; legal databases.  You will generally not receive access to these services until your second semester.  Training on the use of these services is provided by LEXIS-NEXIS&reg; and WESTLAW&reg; representatives.   TechPac, the on-line library catalog, is also available at all workstations. 
<P>
For additional information on electronic legal research services, try the <A HREF="http://www.lexis-nexis.com">LEXIS-NEXIS&reg;</A> or <A HREF="http://www.westlaw.com">WESTLAW&reg;</A> web sites.

CALI provides over 90 different interactive lessons on 20 different areas of the law.  "CALI is a consortium of 155 law schools.  It was formed in 1982 by the University of Minnesota Law School and Harvard Law School to coordinate the distribution and use of computerized instructional materials and to support the sharing of information on computer applications in legal education and law."  (CALI 1995-1996 catalog).  The TTU School of Law is a CALI member.   As a CALI membership school, students are allowed to copy the CALI lessons for use on their home computers.

original form.  When citing to materials found on the Internet, provide the name of the author (if
any), the title or top-level heading of the material being cited, and the Uniform Resource Locator
(URL).  the Uniform Resource Locator is the electronic address of the information and should be
given in angled brackets.  For electronic journals and publications, the actual date of publication
should be given.  Otherwise, provide the most recent modification date of the source preceded by
the term "last modified" or the date of access preceded by the term "visited" if the modification
date is unavailable:<p>

<P>
Chapter 2 addresses whether current statutory and common-law can
be applied to Internet access providers (IAPs). The issue arises
when an IAP has refused to allow a client to obtain information
from the Internet or when an IAP has refused to allow a client
to send information over the Internet. Market forces may be enough
to guarantee equal access at a reasonable cost. However, this
chapter analyzes how current FCC regulations, common carrier law,
and antitrust statutes can be used by NII practitioners when market
forces are not enough. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
Points to Consider<BR>
<UL>
<LI>For the National Information Infrastructure (NII) visions
to be realized, a real infrastructure must exist, not an archipelago
of electronic islands, none of which is connected with the others.
The common carrier laws and statutes are designed to promote a
real infrastructure by legally obligating all IAPs to provide
access to other unrelated IAPs.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Several sources of law exist to promote access: contract law
(express and implied), common law and statutory common carriage
law, and antitrust statutes. In order for any of these laws to
apply, the provider must be a common carrier.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>To determine whether an IAP will be considered a common carrier,
you have to consider the following four questions: 
</UL>
<P>
A.  Does the IAP mass market their services?
<P>
B.  Is their marketing directed toward a general population?
<P>
C.  Do they offer a standardized service?
<P>
D.  Do they offer explicitly or impliedly to accept any message
tendered?
<P>
If the answer to these questions is yes, then the IAP is probably
a common carrier. <BR>
<UL>
<LI>If an IAP is a common carrier then they must comply with the
provisions of Title II of the Federal Communications Act of 1934.
Title II provides in part that a carrier cannot discriminate and
they must establish physical connections and through routes with
other carriers. Antitrust liability is low for most IAPs except
in cases involving joint ventures, exclusive arrangements constituting
vertical and horizontal refusals to deal, and essential facilities.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The probability of antitrust liability is quite low for Intent
service providers due to the fact that all of the established
and reasonably anticipated markets for infrastructure services
are competitive. 
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Joint ventures potentially violate antitrust laws. This is
due to the fact that joint ventures create goods and services
that otherwise would be produced by individual partners in competition
with each other. Ultimately, they amount to agreements to limit
output production because they impliedly involve each partner
withholding its own unilateral efforts to produce the goods or
service that is to be produced by the joint venture.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Tying arrangements are of great concern due to the fact that
customers are required to by products from a corporation for other
products within the software package to function properly. The
essential characteristic lies in the seller's exploitation of
its control over the tying product to force the buyer purchase
items not originally bargained for in the initial deal. Competition
on the merits in the market for the tied item is restrained and
the Sherman Act is violated.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Exclusive dealing arrangements are concerted refusals to deal
with anyone outside the arrangement. An exclusive dealings agreement
can easily violate antitrust laws. The reduction in competition
in either felt by &quot;upstream&quot; or &quot;downstream&quot;
markets. If a supplier unreasonably deprives other suppliers of
goods used as a source supply this would violate the antitrust
laws.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Antitrust essential facilities doctrine prohibits discrimination
by business that have control over Bottlenecks in the market structure.
This violates section 2 of the Sherman Act. There are four elements
of liability.
</UL>
<P>
A.  Control of an essential facility by a monopolist
<OL>
<LI>B.  A competitor's inability practically or reasonably to
duplicate the essential facility
<LI>C.  Denial of the use of the facility to a competitor
<OL>
<LI>D.  The feasibility of providing access to the facility
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>The concept of eminent domain and condemnation have taken
root as applied to the Internet. Sometimes legitimate information
infrastructure goals cannot be without forcing intellectual property
holders to grant access.<BR>
</UL>
</OL>
<P>
<P>
<B>Questions:</B><br>

1. On what theories can an NII practitioner base their claims
against an Internet Access Provider?

<P>
2. What would be fair compensation for those that are faced with
a loss after condemnation? Who should pay? <BR>

<h2 align="center"><strong>CHAPTER 3</strong></h2>

<h3 align="center"><strong>Privacy</strong></h3>

Private information about all of us is now stored in computer networks across the country, and
unless the operators of these networks take special precautions, this information can be readily
accessible by anyone.  This is a growing problem on the Information Superhighway.  Many steps
have been taken by legislatures and courts across the country (and the world) to protect the
privacy of individuals.  The list below contains the ten most important points of Chapter Three.

<ul>
  <li>Privacy rights come from several different sources.  These sources include the U.S.
Constitution, common law,  state and federal statutes, Codes of Good Practice, and Industry
Custom.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Several interests need to be balanced when analyzing privacy issues.  These include the
interests of the subject of the communication, interests of the custodians of information,
governmental interests, and individuals or entities who want to gain information about others.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (EPCA) is a broad federal statute that imposes
duties on information service providers, custodians of information, eavesdroppers, and
intruders.  It protects rights that pertain to intercepting communications and acquiring stored
information.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits accessing a "federal interest computer" in
certain circumstances.  For example, the statute prohibits obtaining national security
information in order to injure the United States, interfering in the government's operation of
the computer,  and destroying information stored on the computer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Federal Privacy Act prohibits certain access to federal agency records.  No record may be
disclosed without consent of the subject of the record  unless the disclosure is related to the
reason the information was collected in the first place.  Federal agencies must implement
security precautions to protect these records.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Financial Records Privacy Act pertain to disclosing and
accessing financial information about individuals.  The FCRA imposes duties on consumer
reporting agencies.  The FRPA prohibits the government from accessing financial information
under certain circumstances.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>States may also enact statutes that protect privacy in electronic communications.  Examples of
these statutes are state data protection laws that may allow access to governmental records,
but do not allow access to certain records of private individuals, and statutes that regulate
disclosure of information to insurance companies.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>When an attorney uses electronic communication with a client or stores information about a
client electronically, he must take precautions to make sure the information and
communications are not unintentionally disclosed.  If  the information is disclosed (even
unintentionally), an attorney will be liable for breach of duty to keep communications and
information confidential.   </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Great Britain has enacted and the European Commission has proposed to enact the
establishment of a data protection supervisory commission that will have such duties as quality
control of data, notifying subjects of decisions based on data, and disclosing data to subjects on
request.  America's counterpart to Europe's proposed duties is the Fair Credit Reporting Act,
which imposes the same types of duties.  The U.S. is likely to enact a data protection act in the
future.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Detecting violations of privacy laws is rather difficult.  One solution to this problem is to 
require technological policing mechanisms.  Another solution to the privacy problem is
encryption.  This will allow only those who have a key to access the information encrypted. </li></ul><p>
</ul>

<ul>
<strong>Questions:</strong><br>
1.  Name the sources of privacy rights in electronic communication and information storage and
give examples of how these sources are applied.
</ul>

<ul>
<p>2.  How could an individual go about increasing his chances that private information that is
electronically stored or transmitted will stay private?

<h2 align="center"><strong>CHAPTER 4</strong></h2>

<h3 align="center"><strong>Liability For Harmful Communications</strong></h3>


Generally, originators of harmful communication on the NII are in the same legal position as they
would be if the communication had been written on paper.  Therefore, this chapter focuses
primarily on the unique problems encountered by intermediary disseminators of information. 
Because of their diminished control over the dissemination of the information, there are several
genuine concerns in regard to potential liability to third parties.  The chapter discusses some of
the causes of action to which intermediaries may be exposed.


<ul>
  <li>One of the primary concerns in regard to potential intermediary liability is the application of the
First Amendment.  Therefore, most of the legal theories available to third parties involve some
form of fault.  The risk of strict liability producing a chilling effect on the dissemination of
communications serves as an incentive to require a showing of fault in regard to claims against
intermediaries.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>There are several types of information torts that are available to injured third parties, including
defamation.  Generally, the standard is that intermediaries are not liable for defamatory
material in the absence of proof that they knew or should have known about the defamatory
character of the information.  The exception to this is when the intermediary undertakes the
responsibility of screening and censoring messages.  Under these circumstances, an
intermediary may be held liable.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>In regard to intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress, intermediaries are not
likely to be held liable.  There is a greater chance that they may be held liable for negligent
infliction of emotional distress if it is accompanied by another cause of action; however, the
known or should have known requirement would be difficult to satisfy in an intentional
infliction case.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Generally, a negligence claim is difficult to establish against intermediaries simply because the
nature of the injury usually involves only economic losses--a form of injury not recognized in
negligence actions by a majority of jurisdictions.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Because a showing of fault is generally required before an intermediary can be held liable for
direct infringement of intellectual property rights, it is unlikely that such a legal theory could be
successfully argued.  On the other hand, if an injured party can show that the instrumentality
which allegedly caused the damage was predominantly used for infringement purposes, the
intermediary may be liable for contributory infringement of intellectual property rights.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Strict products liability may be a plausible legal theory, but only in regard to producers of
geographic information systems, emergency communications systems, and health care
information systems.  The rationale behind this is that these services are not intended for
disseminating a marketplace of ideas, but rather to serve a particular function; thus, strict
liability does not offend the spirit of the First Amendment.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>In general, intermediaries may be analogous to retailers.  Therefore, in jurisdictions in which
retailers may be subjected to strict liability, intermediaries may also be subjected to such
liability.  This analogy is especially relevant when a defective map or chart was the cause of the
injury, and the party can show that the defect existed at the time of the accident.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Intermediaries are, for the most part, not liable for false advertising claims unless the opposing
party can establish that the intermediary had sufficient notice of the falsity of the material.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The tort of interference with contractual relations may be one of the only available remedies
for denial of access to a newsgroup.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Sovereign immunity may be an important concept when, for example, a government official
produced an inaccurate or defective map that caused another=s injury.  In this case, because
the injured party would not be able to recover from the producer of the information,
intermediaries would run a greater risk of being held strictly liable with a slim chance of being
indemnified.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Because personal injury encompasses a large portion of the legal arena, the application of tort
and contractual theories is certain to be a fruitful area for future attorneys.  This chapter
outlines the peculiar elements involved when dealing with intermediary disseminators of
information.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong><br>
1.<strong> </strong>Alice regularly corresponds with her favorite Internet newsgroup--The First Amendment
Groupies.  Often, she and others in the group share their complaints about their professors and
general dissatisfaction with the methods in which they approach First Amendment theory.  While
Alice was communicating with her groupies one afternoon, she mentioned that she found an
article that mirrored her opinions on First Amendment law, as well as a photo to supplement it. 
She had pulled it off of a school web page.  The article contained highly offensive material, and
the picture appeared to be marginally pornographic.  The group--which maintained a set of
guidelines for all who wished to participate with it--immediately refused to allow Alice to
continue to access the newsgroup.  Does Alice have a claim against the newsgroup for refusing to
allow her access to the newsgroup?  What if one of the goals of the newsgroup is to contact
prominent civil rights attorneys and attempt to secure employment positions?  If one of the
Agroupies@ was a member of the group directly addressed by the offensive article and photo,
does she have a claim against the intermediary who assisted in retrieving the material?  How is this
claim affected if the intermediary was regularly engaged in monitoring the information that they
disseminated?   


<p>2.  Although intermediaries generally do not have much control over the information they
disseminate, should some sort of minimum standards be imposed on them under certain
circumstances so that they may be held more accountable for the information they help
disseminate?  Who should set these standards, and how should they be regulated? <P>

<h2 align="center"><strong></a>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></h2><p>

<CENTER><strong><FONT SIZE=4>Liability for Service Failures<BR><BR></FONT></strong></CENTER>

<FONT  SIZE=+1>Because information technology is not perfect, many dissatisfied customers of
information systems firms sue the firm under actions in tort, contract, and
misrepresentation.<P>

The ten most important points to learn from this chapter are as follows:<ul><P></FONT>

  <li><font size="+1">Warranties, express and implied, arise when information systems firms
contract with customers for the use of the Internet and information technology.</font></li></UL>

<UL>
  <li><font size="+1">Implied warranties include the implied warranty of merchantability and the
implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.  The implied warranty of
merchantability states that goods delivered under an agreement made by a
merchant in a given line of trade must be of a quality comparable to that
generally acceptable in that line of trade under the description or designation
of the goods used in the agreement.  The implied warranty of fitness for a
particular purpose arises when a product that may be suitable for ordinary
purposes is unsuitable for special purpose of the buyer.</font></li></UL>

<UL>
  <li><font size="+1">Disclaimer of warranties can be included in the form of a notice.  Usually
this is done in the form of a graphical user interface or written notice.</font></li></UL>

<UL>
  <li><font size="+1">Licenses allow the owner of a copyrighted work to lend the use of that
intellectual property to the licensee and restrict the use of that work. 
However, the use of licenses is subject to the statute of frauds, the first sale
doctrine, and antitrust laws.  </font></li></UL>

<UL>
  <li><font size="+1">Whether the victim can recover under warranty (contract) or strict liability
(tort) depends on two factors:  the damages the aggrieved party is seeking, and
the relationship between the two parties.  Personal injury and physical
property damage recovery is covered by strict liability and tort law.  The law
of warranty and contract law cover economic damages.</font></li></UL>

<UL>
  <li><font size="+1">When a plaintiff is unsophisticated with technology and he or she is very
dependent on the defendant's expertise, the plaintiff may recover under the
theories of tort and contract.</font></li></UL>

<UL>
  <li><font size="+1">In a breach of contract case against a consulting firm, negligence of the
defendant firm is irrelevant.  Instead, the court will look at the foreseeability
of  the damages and the evidence of custom in the trade.  </font></li></UL>

<UL>
  <li><font size="+1">Sellers of information technology can successfully avoid any liability to a
disgruntled former client by using effective disclaimers of warranty and by not
blatantly misrepresenting the abilities of their products.</font></li></UL>

<UL>
<li><font size="+1">Consequential, incidental, and expectation damages are available in a
breach of contract action against a technology seller .  </font></li></UL>

<UL>
<li><font size="+1">The filed tariff doctrine or "filed rate doctrine" insulates a common carrier
from claims by customers for negligent or intentional misquotation of a
tariffed service.  It is presumed by the courts that both the utility and its
customer know the contents and effects of published tariffs.  </font></li></ul>

This chapter has far reaching impacts for attorneys who will represent sellers
of information technology and those who will represent the victims of service
failures.  This chapter also provides insight as to how an information
technology firm can avoid potential lawsuits.  Furthermore, this chapter
informs potential customers of I.S. firms of the complications that can arise
when seeking Internet access.   <P>

<STRONG>Questions</strong><br>

1.  A grants to B a license to use A's computer program, useful in presenting
material in the World Wide Web.  A does this on the condition that B must
withdraw its program that facilitates connections to the Internet.  Is this a
permissible license?  Because the restrictions do more than simply protect the
intellectual property of A, this license probably violates antitrust laws.<P>

2.  What should be the standard for determining whether the plaintiff can
recover under strict liability tort law or contract law?  Should those with only
economic damages be limited to a contract remedy?<p>

<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
Because the trend today is towards networks, internets and intranets,
the National Information Infrastructure (NII) and consumers continually
pressure manufacturers for hardware and software that can be &quot;mixed
and matched.&quot; It is the job of the FCC to regulate standardization,
but the laws governing the FCC are not as updated as quickly as
technology advances. <BR>
<P>
Ten Points of Chapter 8:
<UL>
<LI>The private sector will not always voluntarily set standards
or allow intercommunication between systems because there are
many times when it would be more lucrative to block out competitors
and/or charge high prices for privately developed standardized
software and hardware.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The FCC has a general authority to require standardization.
However, the policy and legal issues with respect to interoperability
and requirements get more difficult as one moves from being a
pure conduit of information to content provider. As one gets closer
to requiring compatibility in content, the harder regulation becomes
under the First Amendment, because one would have a hard time
justifying a prohibition on incompatibility.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The most aggressive legally imposed interconnection and interoperability
requirements are the FCC's comparably efficient interconnection
(CEI) and open network architecture (ONA) requirements.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The FCC has decided not to impose a general interconnection
requirement on commercial mobile radio systems (CMRS) because
the imposition of interconnection obligations have generally been
conditioned on finding monopolies.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Legally, Title II of the Communications Act imposes interconnection
obligations only on common carriers. As noted in Chapter 7, the
FCC has consistency found enhanced service, including information
services, not be common carriers. Thus, any interconnection obligation
would have to have its source in something other than Title II
of the present Communications Act.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The Sherman Antitrust Act covers organizations adopting private
standards. There's a distinction between government standards
that influence competition and private standards. There's no restriction
upon private entities who wish to influence government anti-competitive
actions. There is a presumption that government is not liable
for anti-competition standards. 
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The Noerr Doctrine deals with immunity for anti-trust liability
within governmental entities. This immunity may be applied to
quasi-governmental private standard-setting entities if the economic
interests of the entities are not too closely entangled with their
decision-making functions.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>In <U>Allied Tube &amp; Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc.</U>,
the Supreme Court held that a purely private standard-setting
process would violate anti-trust laws if it excluded particular
products from the marketplace without a legitimate purpose or
through standards that are directed to harm a competitor.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>So long as there is no link between the producer that has
a de facto monopoly and the standard setting organization, abuse
of market power does not exist. A showing of an intent to limit
competition and bad faith makes the possibility of liability higher.
For example, if a producer with a large share of the market makes
its products incompatible with other, potentially complementary,
products, then it risks liability. 
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The Federal government is a powerful purchaser which often
sets standards to make mass acquisition easier. Courts have held
that even though this facilitates a competitive disadvantage,
the specifications are valid. However, they must be justified
and approved in accordance with federal acquisition rules. If
Congress sees fit, it will take corrective measures. <BR>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Questions:</FONT></B>
<P>
1) Some things, like popular software programs such as word processing
programs, are compatible and interoperable, and have been developed
to be this way by the private sector. Why would companies like
Microsoft design their programs to work seamlessly with other
programs, and can this situation be drawn upon in drafting legislation
regarding the interoperability and compatibility of internets
and intranets, etc.?<BR>
<P>
2) Why are private industries discouraged from creating competitive
disadvantages, yet the Federal government can create competitive
disadvantages with immunity, by its purchase power and standard-setting
regulations (which are often influenced by private entities with
market shares)? <BR>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="+2">CHAPTER NINE</strong></font>

<h4 align="center"><strong>Electronic Commerce: Authentication and Electronic Contracting<br><br></strong></h4>

<p>Chapter nine discusses the use of the National Information Infrastructure (NII) in contemporary
and future contractual agreements, commercial transactions, and security. The chapter surmises
that the growing commercial aspect of the Internet will lead to an increasing number of both
on-line commercial transactions and contracts.  Some of these contracts will be entered into by
two parties who conduct their business online instead of in person, and other contracts will be the
result of two computers sending prearranged messages back and forth to each other. 

<p>The introduction of contractual and commercial transactions on the Internet raises several issues
that demand an expansion of current contract and commercial law.  Such expansion includes a
new interpretation of legal theories, the expansion of current legal definitions, and some new legal
guidelines to address issues directly related to transactions conducted through an electronic
medium such as the Internet.  Additionally, the chapter explains how some aspects of electronic
contractual transactions can be combined with the traditional laws dealing with contract
formalities and contract interpretation

<p>The chapter then discusses another area of growing importance on the Internet; electronic funds
transfers.  However, because much of this area is already conducted through an electronic
medium and regulated as such it will only require a small expansion of current law.  This law
includes the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Federal Reserve Regulations E and J, and the
Uniform Commercial Code Articles 4A and 8.  International transactions are regulated by the
international model law on credit transfers which has been adopted by the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) in 1992. 

<p>A major issue identified by the chapter is the vulnerability of such transactions to repudiation and
fraud.  Data Encryption, digital signatures, and hash codes are examples of technological security
measures that are used to ensure the reliability of electronic transactions, thereby providing an
infrastructure within which electronic commerce can occur safely and securely.

<p>How does this chapter apply to the class?  This chapter arguably deals with the most prominent
issues facing the Internet today. Those issues being commercial transactions, contractual
agreements, electronic security measures, and electronic funds transfers. Except for pure
information sources, these areas of Cyberlaw will likely become the most widely used services
that the Internet has to offer. <br>
<ul>
  <li>Contracts are formed online by the usual means of offer and acceptance; however, the offer
usually defines how it may be accepted such as "Click here if you accept" or type "I Accept"
below.  Distinguishing offers from solicitation of offers, and identifying to who an offer is
addressed are important problems of online contracting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Certain formalities, such as requirement for writings and signatures and the parol evidence rule,
define the law of contracts. Such formalities have several purposes: an evidentiary purpose by
ensuring the availability of artifacts that are admissible as evidence; a channeling function by
making a clear intentional legal act; and a cautionary function by inducing deliberation and
reflection before action.  The cautionary function is the most difficult to meet in the computer
world because some contracts are formed with only computers and also people sometimes
ignore the messages on their screen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The Statute of Frauds is an important part of Contract law. The requirement for a signature
online can be met by linking something associated with the signer to the thing signed such as a
PIN number; also, there could be a message that says "type your name here if you intend for it
to be your signature."</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Attestation, contracts under seal, authentication, and notarization are also important formalities
of contract law that are currently being addressed by the commercial computer industry. </li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Electronic commercial contracting is a likely source of contract-interpretation disputes because
computer messages in the commercial context are terse and have meaning only when
connected with context.  To interpret the contract, one can use a "four corners" technique, the
actual conduct of the parties, or the common "trade usage" approach. </li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Contract formation and interpretation disputes can be significantly reduced by the use of
certain encryption techniques.  Public key encryption allows digital signatures to be affixed to
electronic messages.  Also, the hash code, a numerical quantity computed from the contents of
the message, can be used to determine if there have been any alterations to the message. </li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Public key encryption can be used for protecting against the risks of forgery and repudiation in
electronic contracting.  The persons sending and receiving messages have both a public key
and a private key.  The person sending the message uses the addressee's public key to encrypt
the message and the addressee uses his private key to decode the message. </li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Certification authorities are a type of infrastructure where "key certificates" are kept. The key
certificates take the form of standardized records with identifying information about the key
holder, etc. </li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the UCC Art. 4A, and the Federal Reserve Regulations all
govern electronic fund transfer.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Commercial transactions are moving away from document-based transactions with the revision
of UCC Article 8, credit cards over the NII, and securities offerings over the NII </li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Questions<br></strong><br>

1. Commentator Lon Fuller postulated that formalities such as signatures in contract law perform
three distinct functions:  an evidentiary function, a cautionary function, and a channeling function. 
Why does electronic contracting invite rethinking of the channeling function?<br><p>

2. The public key encryption system is an attractive technology that involves a private key and a
public key in order to send private messages back and forth.  The book suggests that a person's
private key should be kept in secret to prevent forged documents or access to that person's
account, etc.  In addition, it is also suggests that if the private key should fall into the wrong
hands, liability rests with the private key holder.  Private keys are usually extremely long.  How is
one to go about protecting a number that must be written down or on the computer in order to
utilize it?  How far should private key holder liability run?<br><p>

<h4 align="center"><strong>Public Information</strong></h4>

<p>Public information is attractive to electronic publishers because of high demand and a general lack
of intellectual property encumbrances.  Public information policies establish equal access as the
"centerpiece of an information policy" at all levels of government.  However, public information
policy is a complex balancing of the competing interests of  the public, bureaucrats, and private
sector publishers.  The public interest in accessing government information is as fundamental as
the need to be informed in order to fully participate in the political system.  The bureaucrat
interest is founded in the interests of recovering the cost of dissemination and in the temptation to
ease budget pressures by appropriating revenue from the sale of profitable private sector
contracts.  The private sector interest lies in the potentially lucrative business of meeting the high
demand for electronically available information.  This chapter synthesizes the policies that govern
public information availability.  Additionally, this chapter analyzes the legal obligations that
govern agency responses to requests for electronic access.  Finally, this chapter explores the
impact of copyright, antitrust, and Constitutional considerations on public information published
electronically.  


<p>Ten Key Elements of the Chapter

<ul>
  <li>Freedom of Information Acts (FOIA) at the federal and state levels grant the right to obtain
and copy government records.  These protect against state-established monopolies over public
information and form the core of an electronic publisher's right to access  public information.</li>

  <li>Though FOIA laws vary from federal-to-state and from state-to-state levels, most states do
agree that electronic formats are covered under the acts. Most states also agree that requesters
can specify computer formats when available.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Exemptions to FOIA statutes include situations where the invasion of privacy may be
considered "unreasonable" or  "unwarranted".  However, agency denial of access to computer
formats should be scrutinized closely as agencies may attempt to use these "privacy"
considerations as a subterfuge to protect lucrative monopoly electronic publishing
arrangements.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Under the Copyright Act, federal agencies may not obtain copyrights in public information. 
Copyright covers only "original works of authorship" and so does not extend to factual
information. </li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Trademark protection is potentially available to all three levels of government. Thus, arguably
a public agency could obtain a trademark for its information products and then limit the use to
those licensed by the public agency.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Public contracting law provides competition for contracts between the agencies in possession
of public information and private entities that may add value enhancements and distribution
channels. Such contracts authorize agencies to enter into exclusive arrangements with
successful bidders; however they do not allow exclusive arrangements for dissemination of the
public information.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Constitutional considerations include fundamental rights under the First Amendment limitations
on copyright and on direct restrictions on access and publication which trigger substantive due
process and equal protection concerns under the Fourteenth Amendment.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>An explicit establishment of an information monopoly, unsupported by legal justification,
would violate the Sherman Act.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Public information is an exception to the international treaty requiring that signatories respect
one another's intellectual property; therefore, public information copyrights could be easily
violated by moving and disseminating the information through the Internet from a foreign
country.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Government agencies are permitted to recover the cost of dissemination of the public
information.  The price charged for electronic data should include the incremental or marginal
cost of providing public access, this includes modems or Internet connections directly
attributable to public access.</li>

</ul>

<p>Practical Applications

<p>Numerous practical questions would arise  if our WebMaster group decided that we should use
our Webpage to publish current unannotated versions of Texas statutes. First,  we would have to
address the issue of whether or not we could republish the statutes. Second, we would need to
know from where we could get the information.  Could we simply download the statutes from
Lexis or Westlaw and put them on our page?  Could we contact the Texas Legislative Service to
get our name on a mailing list that would advise us of changes in the statutes?  If so, could the
state charge us for this?  Many of these questions are answered in this chapter of Perritt's book. 
Simply put, the state would have to make the statutes available to us in the form requested
provided the documents are stored in such manner.  The state could charge us a price reasonably
related to the cost of providing the information to us.   Services such as Lexis and Westlaw
cannot maintain a monopoly over the statutes.  However, they may copyright the value that they
add to the information.  An example of such a copyright is West's key numbering system. 
Additionally, we as students,  have contracted with to use our I.D.'s only for "educational
purposes, republication is forbidden."  Therefore, if we wanted to use the information directly
from either Lexis or Westlaw, we would have to obtain their permission.    


<p><strong>QUESTIONS</strong><br>1. Could you as an attorney contract with the city of Brownfield to have exclusive rights to 
publish on the Internet the city's ordinances?


<p>2. What legal principles, current Copyright Act aside, should limit the assertion of a  copyright on
public information?

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>CIVIL DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND PROCEDURE
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
Transactions conducted in the electronic medium often transcend
state and national boundaries, making it very difficult for any
one sovereign entity to have a final say in how resulting disputes
should be resolved. This chapter suggests that several of the
traditional principles of American civil procedure can be applied
effectively to handle controversies arising in cyberspace.<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>A court has jurisdiction to decide a controversy only when
four procedural requirements have been met: personal jurisdiction;
notice by service of process or otherwise; choice of law; and
venue. However, as commercial transactions and litigation become
increasingly global, these procedural rules will have to be reconciled
with their foreign counterparts.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The author applies analyses used in cases involving print
publications because they, like electronic publications, quickly
and easily reach and affect numerous jurisdictions. He comes to
the conclusion that electronic publishers should be subject to
personal jurisdiction in any place to which they intentionally
send their publications. However, where clear intent seems to
be lacking, such as where the electronic publisher posts his message
to a list without having specific knowledge of each recipient
listed, the exercise of person jurisdiction probably would not
be reasonable or appropriate.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The service of process accomplishes two purposes: it asserts
personal jurisdiction over the defendant and it notifies him of
the suit. Traditionally, written notice was served on the defendant
personally or it was otherwise made in some constitutionally adequate
form which was reasonably calculated to give actual notice. Jurisdictions
have been slow to replace paper-borne notice with electronic service.
The federal rules now permit electronic notices under very limited
circumstances.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Forum selection clauses help parties to an electronic commerce
transaction to circumvent the requirements of venue statutes.
Should a dispute arise, these clauses virtually eliminate the
worry about where the dispute will be litigated.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Because the interested parties in an electronic transaction
often are widely separated geographically, the author suggests
the creation of a body of universal guidelines and rules which
will apply specifically to the information superhighway. These
rules, however, will have to be broad in scope so as to accommodate
a wide range of contingencies.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Arbitration can be especially effective in the NII context.
One advantage to arbitration is the arbitration agreement between
the parties can select the arbitrators, arbitration procedures,
and choice of law to suit the nature of claims arising in the
NII better than by traditional judicial procedure with generalist
judges. Another advantage to arbitration in the NII context is
that parties have greater certainty as to the enforceability of
international arbitration awards than the enforceability of the
judgments of regular courts. The basic legal framework for arbitration
is the same in domestic cases and in international cases.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Electronically stored documents are admissible if the systems
storing and producing them are shown to be reliable and capable
of producing authentic copies of the originals. Computer generated
documents cannot be self-authenticating, but testimony by the
record custodian as to the identifying characteristics on the
record can be sufficient foundation to admit records in court.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The purpose of the statute of frauds, which is to prefer written
instead of oral evidence of a contract, can be satisfied by computer
writings and signatures. Marks made by computer printers or by
the write head on a computer disk drive taking the form of a digital
signature satisfy the general definition of a signature or mark.
However, the real issue becomes how to prove that a particular
party or their authorized agent made the mark. As long as the
party can establish that the computer methods are reliable and
trustworthy, the information should be admitted. The opposing
party is free, of course, to raise reasonable questions as to
the trustworthiness of the information.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Electronic technology does not distinguish between originals
and copies, because each digital representation is a copy of a
digital representation that existed somewhere else. The &quot;best
evidence rule&quot; is satisfied by normal output of a computer
since this output is the best evidence of what data is stored
in the computer. Similarly, transcripts and summaries can take
the place of electronic records that have been destroyed in the
normal course of business. 
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Computer records that are made in the ordinary course of business,
that are relied on for the performance of regular business activities,
and that are deemed reliable will satisfy the business records
exception to hearsay. The party wanting to use the computer records
should establish the reliability of the computer system used in
the ordinary course of business by the use of expert testimony.
The party must prove the following to qualify computer information
under this exception: (1) the document is a business record; (2)
the document has probative value; (3) the computer equipment used
is reliable; and (4) reliable data processing techniques were
used.<BR>
<LI>More lawyers are now using video depositions, and some courts
allow the video in trial especially if the witness is dead, is
more than 100 miles from the place of trial or outside the country,
is unable to attend because of physical ailments, or other extenuating
circumstances. If the video is used during the trial, it must
be made a part of the record for purposes of appeal. Video depositions
can be effective in trials, and jurors and judges are usually
receptive to well produced videos with testimony, documents, and
computer graphics. However, such demonstrative evidence is often
criticized for being more prejudicial than probative -- the trier
of fact needs to concentrate on the issues of the trial and not
on which lawyer has the best trial production.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Courts are starting to use video production, such as video
transcripts and video arraignments, in order to make court proceedings
more efficient. As more technology becomes available in the courtroom,
videotaped trials may be used. Opening and closing statements
by the attorneys would be live in front of the judge and jurors,
but the trial will consist of video taped depositions and presentation
of evidence that has been approved by the trial judge. The attorneys
are on hand to monitor the viewing of the trial. <BR>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<U><B>QUESTIONS:</B></U><BR>
1. What forms of service of process are considered to be valid
under the federal rules?<BR>
<BR>
2. What are the ethical considerations in dealing with video depositions,
computer generated evidence, and video trials? Is there such a
thing as &quot;too much technology&quot;?<BR>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="+2">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</strong></font>

<h4 align="center"><strong>Criminal Law<br><br></strong></h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Computers and the Internet present new problems and challenges for the current criminal law
system.  Criminals now have new opportunities and tools available to them that demand
questioning the applicability of existing criminal statutes and procedures.  In addition, the
creation of these new electronic mediums create a new set of crimes, before unrealized by
traditional legislators.  Finally, the international nature of the NII makes enforcement and
locating of electronic wrongdoing difficult and logistically problematic from a jurisdictional
standpoint.  The following are ten important points covered in this chapter about criminal law in
cyberspace:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>The law covers fraudulent use of the Internet in the same way as fraudulent use of mail
service.  In 1952, Congress amended the Communications Act of 1934 to treat wire fraud
like mail fraud.  Criminal prosecution for both mail and wire fraud involves a two-pronged analysis: The government must prove that 1) a scheme has been formed with the
intent to defraud and 2) that the defendant furthered the fraudulent scheme with use of the
mails or wires.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>A court ruled in <u>United States v. LaMacchia</u> that an act of making available pirated
software on the Internet for others to download was not criminal under the wire fraud
statute since it was not done for the purposes of commercial advantage or private
financial gain. The implications of this 1994 ruling are far-reaching for the business
world and private Internet users.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>The Computer Fraud Abuse Act criminalizes gaining unauthorized access to certain
computers when that access causes certain results. Examples include the following:
obtaining classified government information, obtaining records of a financial institution,
and transmitting computer viruses.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Child pornography is the focus of federal pornography statutes. These statutes criminalize
advertisements that seek to receive, exchange, buy, produce, display, distribute, or
reproduce any sexually explicit visual depiction of a minor. The predicate mental state is
knowingly or having reason to know that the advertisement will be transported in
interstate or foreign commerce by any means including computer. The statutes even
criminalize establishing a cyberlink at one site that links to an illegal advertizement at
another site.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Section 2314 of Title 18 deals with transportation of stolen property. There is
disagreement, however, over whether the stolen property must be tangible. Courts are not
in agreement on whether the electronic nature of information moving from one computer
to another across state lines defeats the "goods, wares, merchandise, security or money"
element of section 2314. </li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) covers some forms of
computer crimes.  Possible crimes which would come under the RICO act include:
gambling, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter or drugs, wire fraud, interstate
transportation of stolen property, and possibly any acts that come under Title 29
(embezzlement from union funds), Title 11 fraud (securities fraud and drug offenses) and
offences indictable under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act.  For a
pattern to be established, two offences must have been perpetrated within 10 years of
each other.  In addition, prosecutors must demonstrate a threat of continuing racketeering
activity.  The main purpose of this act is to punish the crime of being a criminal.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) allows for broad search and seizure
procedures, through warrants, of electronic communications and stored streams.  The 30-day limitation of the warrants, which are limited to specific persons and types of
information, can be extended for longer periods of time in the event the communications
are in a foreign language and need to be decoded or translated.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) regulates electronic surveillance of
foreign powers and agents.  The purpose of this act is not to monitor criminal conduct,
but rather to monitor foreign intelligence for purposes of national security. These taps are
non consensual and cannot last longer than one year. The Act requires certification by the
attorney general and a certification by the assistant to the president for national security
affairs or by another executive branch authorized by the application that the terms of the
Act have been complied with.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Damage awards are recoverable under 42 U.S.C  1983 for privacy invasions by federal
officials under an implied private right of action for constitutional violations.  Private
parties can also be held liable under  1983 when they initiate the judicial process in
violation of another's privacy rights.  </li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>There are two concepts relating to interests in search and seizure law: 1) The interest of
law enforcement agencies in obtaining evidence to facilitate prosecution, and; 2) the
interest of private parties in not being exposed to intrusive inquiries.  In approaching
search and seizure legislation on an international level, new treaties and cooperation must
exist between nations and jurisdictions.  The possible extension of the fourth amendment
to foreign searches may help resolve some of the conflict.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p><strong><u>Questions:</u></strong><br>
1. What is the basic difference between search warrants and subpoenas?   Which method
authorizes greater intrusion into privacy?  Why?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2. What are some possible consequences of asserting United States Power of search and
seizure procedures and regulations on uncooperative foreign entities?<P>

<FONT  SIZE=+2><center><strong>Course Summary</strong></center><p></FONT>

This course will be the first law school course of its kind utilizing the vast resources of the Internet to research, evaluate, and present the development of law in cyberspace. The course provides a rare opportunity to study and participate in the developmental stage of a complex body of law that may have the greatest impact on social, business, and legal culture since the industrial revolution.<P>

<FONT  SIZE=+2><center><strong>Course Objectives</strong></center><p></FONT>
This unique course will teach law students to use the rapidly expanding resources of the Internet in the practice of law and to identify the laws and legal issues related to cyberspace. The course will focus on "on-line" law practice skills that are in increasing demand by law firms. Course format will include a mix of classroom lectures, on-line class sessions, traditional textbook sources, and on-line course materials. The course does not require prior Internet experience, but does require a working knowledge of personal computers. On-line discussions will include participation by judges, lawyers, Texas Bar and ABA representatives, and on-line legal experts. The class will develop and use its own Web Page for class communication, research, and access to Internet resources. Student evaluations will be based on class projects, special assignments, and a final paper. (There will not be a final exam.)  Final papers will be expected to be of "publishable" quality and will be considered for publication as part of a special on-line publication focusing on legal issues related to the Internet. The two substantive areas of focus for the class will be:<p>

<STRONG>Influence of the Internet on the Practice of Law including:</STRONG><br>
(1) attorney advertising and solicitation;<br>
(2) on-line legal research and discovery; <br>
(3) on-line practice of law; <br>
(4) electronic filings and hearings with courts/judges; <br>
(5) on-line ethics and professionalism; <br>
(6) computer-based law partnerships; and<br><P>

<STRONG>Application of State, Federal, and International Laws to the Internet including,</STRONG><br>
(1) Constitutional law (freedom of speech, censorship, and obscenity); <br>
(2) trademark and copyright law; <br>
(3) tort and contract law; <br>
(4) regulatory and administrative law; and <br>
(5) international and model laws.<br><P>

O.K.  Here is an update on the status of Law in Cyberspace. First, I am
extremely pleased with the progress we are making. With your other class
commitments, you probably do not have the luxury to sit back and look at the
big picture, but that is my job and I see great success in process. <P>

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>Update by project:</B></FONT></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>Webmasters:</STRONG>  Our webmasters, under the direction of Dave Brown, have exceeded
all expectations in getting our page up, running, and creatively expanding the page
on a weekly basis.  We can be proud to direct anyone's attention to our
page.  Their combined efforts over the first five weeks are quickly reaching
several hundred hours (literally). We will schedule one class hour (probably
Nov. 6) for a Webmaster presentation to review the technical and strategic
process they have used to develop our page and to provide recommendations
for formating a page for future law practice use.<P>

<STRONG>Cyberclass Sessions:</STRONG>   Thanks to the lead of Brandy Whittington, we have
successfully set up and used a MIRC (internet relay chat).  We need to
provide recommendations for using the format effectively for guest
"speakers" during October and November.  So far we have the following
on-line "guest speaker" opportunities:<p>

1) Mark Obie, CEO of Consel Connect;<br>
2) Gordon Bermant, Director of Planning and Technology for the Federal Judicial Center; <br>
3) Peter Vogel, SBOT Director and founder of State Bar of Texas Computer Law Section; <br>
4) Joseph Jacobson, Pres and CEO of Obelisk Communications (atty web page developer);<br>
5) Henry Perritt, author of our textbook;<br>
6) Chief Justice Tom Phillips, Texas Supreme Court<P>

We also have discussed co-sponsoring an on-line seminar with Law Schools
On-line, the Counsel Connect Internet network of law schools.  This may be
our best opportunity to get the various judicial contacts into a single program.<P>

<STRONG>VideoClass Sessions:</STRONG>  Room 109 appears to be available and reserved for our
use during wednesdays in October.  We have confirmed Lamar McCorkle, 133rd
Civil District Judge in Harris County, and a Lexis-Nexis Consultant/faculty
member from Georgetown Law School. Our other top targets are still Bill
Gates and Roberta Cooper Ramo (until and unless they say no).<P>

<STRONG>CyberJournal: </STRONG> We have a good working list of topics.  Full sentence outlines
should be completed and will be collected tomorrow (Oct. 2).  Initial paper
draft deadline is now October 16.  Cross-editing to be completed by October
30.  Final paper versions due November 6.<P>

<STRONG>SideCyber Journal:</STRONG>  We now know of at least four opportunities to submit
class papers for outside publication:  Buffalo Law Review Symposium, Richmond
Journal of Law and Technology, Journal of Information Law and Technology,
and the State Bar of Texas Computer Law Journal.  Other opportunities for
publication will be investigated.<P>

<STRONG>Cyber.Edu Reporters and Historians:</STRONG>  First draft of general publication
article has been prepared, photo and video sessions are being scheduled. 
Remember that we will be taking "class pictures tomorrow (October 2, comb
your hair and wear clean socks).<P>

<STRONG>Chapter Summaries on-line:</STRONG>  First 4 chapter summaries and class presentations
have been completed.  Class is reminded that primary responsibility to review
chapters and answer 2 questions rests with each student.  I will collect
answers to the questions for chapters 3, 4, 5, and 9 on October 9.
Presentations for chapters 6 and 11 are still scheduled for October 9.<P>


Let me know if I have missed anything.<p>

My purpose in going to law school was to be a better computer/management consultant.  Which I did for 2 years after I got out of law school.  Then about 18 years ago I started practicing law, now most of time is related to trials....

More specifically, what do we put in our resumes, and say in our interviews to communicate this knowledge?<br>{Herp} I think it is important, but can you recommend how far we should go with it:  should we do as you did, and learn programming, etc., or will basic experience on a PC work as well?<br><FONT  COLOR="#FF0000">{petervogel} Knowing how to use computers is all that is important... one of the great features of gui (graphical user interface- the mouse) is that you really do not have to understand how to program.... to be hired in many jobs, your future employers will expect you to know how to conduct legal research, and draft contracts and pleadings.</FONT><br><FONT  COLOR="#FF0000">{petervogel} so the more you can do on the computer, the better a lawyer you will be.<br>{petervogel} For the first 14 years I practiced without a secretary... just computers!</FONT><br>{Herp} that's quite impressive!<br>{Brandeis} How receptive are established practitioners to the use of computers in their practice? how about judges?<br><FONT  COLOR="#FF0000">{petervogel} I always perceived that as a sole practioner I was on an equal footing with large law firms... that is certain even truer today.</FONT><br>{kaybaby} Are you still a solo practioner?<br>{MiPS} If you had one year to dedicate to taking computer courses useful in law, would you goto a technical institute or an undergraduate or not at all<br>{ProfWinick} Are computer companies using large attorney firms to represent them, or is the trend towards in house counsel or specialists?<br><FONT  COLOR="#FF0000">{petervogel} Good lawyers understand the value of computers... and are taking the time to learn to use computers themselves.  The State Bar has many seminars to help lawyers learn about computers.<br>{petervogel} I joined Gardere & Wynne about 5 years ago...and run the computer technology practice here in the Trial Department</FONT><br><FONT  COLOR="#FF0000">{petervogel} Many judges expect jury charges on diskettes... even though they themselves are not computer mavens.</FONT><br>{Herp} Can you estimate what percentage of Texas lawyers are using the Internet today?<br><FONT  COLOR="#FF0000">{petervogel} Even though there are more and more in-house lawyers... most companies rely on good outside lawyers.  Lawyers who do a great job get more work... regardless of the size of the firm they practice with.<br>{petervogel} It is difficult to estimate about internet's use by lawyers... because many people/lawyers plug into Compuserv, AOL, and the like and access Internet.  <br>{petervogel} I have given a number of speeches about practicing law on the internet, and I am always surprised that the majority of the lawyers in the audience have internet/AOL/Compuserve experiences.</FONT><br>{Brandeis} What are the most common uses of attorneys using the internet (email, advertising, research, etc.)?<br><FONT  COLOR="#FF0000">{petervogel} I do have a great war story about practicing law on the internet:</FONT><br><FONT  COLOR="#FF0000">{petervogel} A client of mine from Amsterdam (Holland) called me one day to insist that I get our former US distributor out a trade show in San Francisco that very afternoon.</FONT><br>*** nziggy (user@lwm228-8.law.ttu.edu) has joined #cyberlaw<br><FONT  COLOR="#FF0000">{petervogel} While I was explaining to him how costly it was and how long it took to get a temporary injunction in California courts from Texas...

Later that day the former distributor came to the trade show and his badge was taken away from him, and he was persona non grata at the show.<br>{petervogel} We have regular training and a help desk.<br>{petervogel} But we are migrating to a new windows 95 network and expect to train about 600+ employees with about 3 days training next winter!!!<br>{petervogel} not all at one time that is... over about a 3 month training schedule.</FONT><br>{ProfWinick} Back to resumes, should we devote an area of the resume to Computer Experience/skills?<br>{kaybaby} Wow, I was about to be really impressed.

<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=INTRODUCTION>I.  INTRODUCTION</A></strong>

<p>The phenomenal growth of the Internet as a commercial medium is evidenced by the fact that the
number of active Internet domains has increased almost exponentially from 21,000 domains in
January 1993 to 240,000 domains in January 1996,<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and there are now an estimated 49 million
Internet users in 96 different countries.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  There are roughly 15 million U.S. Internet users, which
works out to about one in every 18 Americans<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, and this  growth is expected to continue with an
estimated 152 million Web users world wide by the year 2000.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the enormous potential of using the Internet, and the
National Information Infrastructure (NII), to attract clients to your law firm by establishing your
presence on the Internet via a Home Page.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  In this paper I'll describe how a Solo Practitioner or
small law firm can afford to compete with the Mega Firms by using an Internet Web site to
attract and keep good clients, who will in turn, refer you to their friends.  I'll also discuss how to
get connected to the Internet, and how to use other aspects of the Internet to enhance your
practice, such as the use of e-mail.  Security and confidentiality concerns of using the Internet for
more than just advertising will also be addressed.  In addition I'll explain how the uncontrolled
use of the Internet by law firm employee's can be a detriment to your law practice, because of the
addictive nature of Net-browsing or Cyber-surfing, and the inherent difficulties of quickly
finding needed information in the vast abyss of Cyberspace. Finally, I'll examine the various
regulations and constraints on using the Internet for commercial advertising, as well as some of
the potential pitfalls of contacting clients on the Internet and the need to avoid the appearance, or
practice of solicitation using the Internet.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=INTEGRATING>II. INTEGRATING YOUR HOME PAGE INTO YOUR TOTAL ADVERTISING
SCHEME</A></strong>

<p>One of the obvious concerns about the effectiveness of using the Internet to get clients is the very
fact that it is global, and your law firm only handles local matters.  How, you might ask, is this
going to be useful if the vast majority of the 49 million people using the Internet don't live in
your community?  You might be tempted to write off the Internet as an advertising media, by
thinking that it could only be useful to the international megafirms.  You might think that it could
never be useful to a sole practitioner in a small community.  You might be wrong.  While most of
the several hundred law firms who now have a Web site or Home page on the Internet are large
firms, the Internet still offers some very significant possibilities for small firms and sole
practitioners.  To begin with, the mere fact that you list your Internet Home Page address on your
business card or Yellow Pages advertisement should send a clear message to potential clients. 
The implication is that your firm is on the leading edge, has a national or international clientele,
or at least can handle a variety of cases.  You may just be a sole-practitioner with a general
practice, but the psychological message you send to potential clients is that "you're connected",
you know what you're doing, and you've got on-line computer assets to help solve client
problems.

<p>Beyond this initial perception is the very real possibility that people who you give a business card
to, and you invite to "look you up on the Internet" may in fact be interested enough to do just
that.  Once they call up your Home Page, you then have the opportunity to tell them about your
law firm in a straight forward and unpressured way.  They can get to know you better, see what
kinds of legal services you provide, and learn something about you and the rest of your law firm. 
It's like handing every client a multi-page, glossy color brochure about your law firm, every time
you give them a business card or they see your ad in the Yellow Pages.  The truth is that most
people in America don't have a family lawyer, and when they think they have a legal problem
and want to talk to an attorney, they don't even know who to ask for a recommendation.  So if
their only contact with your law firm is through a Yellow Page ad that includes your Web Site
address, then they are likely to look you up on the Internet before they start calling around to find
a lawyer.  Finding you on the Internet is fairly easy for many people, and from the clients
perspective it's a no pressure opportunity to find out if your law firm is right for them.

<p>By putting information on your Home Page about the various types of legal issues your firm
handles, you answer one of the first questions a new client is likely to have.  Your Web Site can
be even more comprehensive than a color brochure, more far-reaching than a Yellow Page ad,
and more dynamic and current than anything you could produce on paper.  For example you can
instantly update your Home Page to add information about a new attorney, or news about the
outcome of a big case you are handling.  You can make your Home Page as complete, up to date
and dynamic as you want, and all for a fraction of the cost of a small Yellow Page ad. 

<p>You can use your Home Page to host a virtual tour of your law firm by providing a map of where
your located, a picture of your office building, and even a video showing from a clients eye-view
where you'll go and who you'll meet when the client first visits your firm.  You can introduce
individual attorneys to prospective clients with hypertext links that take you to that attorney's
resume.  The resume page could include a color photo of the attorney as well as describing the
attorney's areas of expertise, accomplishments, legal education, and the various civic groups that
the attorney is associated with.  In this way the perspective client can get to know the attorney
before he or she ever meets the attorney face to face.  You can also showcase your firms
expertise in specific fields of law, create hypertext links to articles that you have published,
provide information on court cases the firm has handled, or indicate some of the various clients
you routinely represent.  This sort of information can provide a perspective client with a lot of
insight as to whether your firm would be right for them.  You may also want to include
information on billing policies, or even standard fees for routine client matters like uncontested
divorce, or Chapter 7 Bankruptcies.  You can also handle specific requests for information about
your firm via an e-mail hypertext link that will allow the perspective client to immediately
contact the firm or a specific attorney with a question.  You can then get back with the client via
e-mail or phone, to schedule a personal office visit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=CONNECTED>III. GETTING CONNECTED AND USING E-MAIL</A></strong>

<p>The question of how to get connected to the Internet basically breaks down into three sub-issues;
what type of network tools (hardware and software) are required, the ease of operation, and how
large of a connection is needed.  The answer really depends on how you plan to use the Internet,
and how much money you're willing to invest in this connection.

<p>To begin with, your connection to the Internet will require three basic items: 1) a
communications hardware device, such as a modem, 2) communications software, and 3) an
Internet Service Provider (ISP).  The modem and software is not much of a problem since most
new computers are sold with internal modems, and will probably have communication software
pre-loaded.  If you're buying a new computer or an external modem, the main concern will be the
speed of the modem, and as far as this goes, faster is better.  Most new computers today will be
sold with an internal modem that has an operating speed of 28.8 to 36.6 Kbps.  This should be
plenty of speed for most users, especially if you are primarily downloading text files, rather than
a lot of graphics.  A small piece of text can be transmitted in a split second, while a picture can
typically take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes.  A Web page that contains two
kilobytes of information will take about a second to load using a 28.8 Kbps modem.  A graphics
page, however, may have as much as 60 kilobytes of text and graphics, and would take almost
half a minute to load.  Consequently, if there is not a big difference in hardware prices, a faster
modem is desirable.

<p>The more difficult question of getting on the Internet is who to chose as your Internet Service
Provider (ISP).  Like long distance telephone service providers, there are a lot of ISP's on the
market, and picking the right one for you is not an easy decision.  The best advice is to talk to
people who are already using an ISP and find out if they are happy with the service and the price. 
One very reasonably priced option for an ISP is SPRYNET, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
CompuServe Incorporated (phone # 206-957-8995 ext 6148).  They offer a monthly rate of
$19.95 for unlimited Internet access, and use of e-mail.  In addition, they also include in this
package deal  5 Megabyte of storage on their server for you to use to house your Web site.  This
is a tremendous deal, especially considering the fact that with 5 Megabytes of storage you can use
build a Home Page with lots of graphics, pictures, and reams of text.  The bottom line is, if you
design and develop your own Home Page, you can establish a very respectable presence on the
Internet for the very affordable price of less than twenty dollars a month.  Internet access alone is
worth that much, even if you're not completely sold on the ultimate value of having your own
Home Page.

<p>Developing your own Home Page is not an impossible task, and there is even free information on
the Internet to explain how to do it.  One such guide on how to write in HTML (HyperText
Markup Language) can be found at the following URL address:   

<p>(  http://ark.ship.edu/%7Epfdemp/htmlguide/pdhtmle.html ).  Another very good source on how
to develop a Home Page is given in <u>The Lawyer's Guide to the Internet</u><a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>, which not only
provides the basics of writing in HTML, but also provides a lot of useful guidance on design and
layout, all tailored to advertising by lawyers.

<p>If you don't have the time or inclination to develop your own Home Page there are a number of
entrepreneurs who will do it for you at prices starting around $100.  Various   advertisements for
this service can be found in legal periodicals, as well as on the Internet itself.  You can find a
number of good examples of Law Firm Home Pages by looking on the Internet at the West Legal
Directory (WLD), at (  http://www.wld.com   ).  They advertise a complete Web Site service,
where they will help you design your Home Page, put all the information you want in your Home
Page in hypertext markup language (html), and act as your Internet Service Provider.  Their rate,
which starts at about $400.00 per year ($33.34 per month), is not the cheapest route to go, but it's
still considerably less than a typical Yellow Page ad, and they make it happen for you without a
lot of effort on your part.  One of the advantages they have in this regard is that unlike other Web
sites, the West Legal Directory "Firm Site" can integrate your attorney's West Legal Directory
listing automatically, for timely and complete information, while not using up any space on your
"Firm Site" and incurring no extra charges for updating.  While there are cheaper alternatives
available, the West Legal Directory is worth checking out just to get ideas on how to design and
set up your Home page.  

<p>An alternative for building your own Web site, without the problem of learning HTML, and
without the expense and time delays of having someone do it for you, is to use some of the new
software products now available that allow you to create your Web site by simply using your
familiar word processor, and letting the software re-write it into HTML.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  One example of this
software is Internet Publisher, an HTML software conversion program that is now included with
Corel's WordPerfect Suite 7 for Windows 95.  In addition to providing a WordPerfect template
for creating HTML, the software also includes the Netscape Web browser and Envoy document
viewer.  You can get more information on this, and other software, from Novell's Web site at:(
http://www.novell.com/ ).

<p>One final note, when you establish your Home Page you may want to decide on and reserve a
unique domain name for your site.  There are presently over 100,000 unique domain names, with
more than 5,000 names being registered every week.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>  The vast majority of these domain names
are for companies, and more and more law firms are registering their unique domain name for
their Home Page.  You don't have to reserve a unique domain name.  When you sign up with an
Internet Service Provider, and place your Web site on their server, they will assign you an e-mail
address and Home page address domain name, usually using your name or initials @ the ISP's
address.  So if your ISP is Airmail, your e-mail address would be ( yourname@airmail.net ).  If
you later change to a different ISP, like IBM, then your e-mail address would change to (
yourname@ibm.net ).  That may not be a big deal, unless of course your yellow pages ad, your
letter head, and all your business cards have the old address printed on them.  So you can either
stick with your shell account at the same ISP forever, or get a direct connection to the Internet
and chose your unique domain name that never has to change.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>  You can check on the
availability of a domain name by calling (703) 742-4777, or e-mailing your request for
information to ( postmaster@re.internic.net ).  Although registration of Internet domain names
used to be free, in September of 1995, InterNIC announced a new fee policy of charging $50.00 a
year to maintain a domain name, with an advance payment of $100.00 for the first two years to
be paid within thirty days of receiving the domain name activation from InterNIC.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>  Forms for
registering a domain name are available over the Internet at (   http://www.internic.net/   ).  For a
modest fee, your ISP may be able to register your domain name for you.

<p>In addition to establishing your Internet presence with a Home Page, the other equally valuable
marketing tool on the Internet is the use of e-mail.  An e-mail message resembles an office
memorandum and is basically a text message, with the possibility of attaching other files.  When
sent, the e-mail will arrive at the recipient's in-basket at his Internet Service Providers computer. 
When the recipient checks the mail, the e-mail letter is transferred to his computer where he can
read it on-screen.  The use of e-mail can be a very useful tool for communicating routine matters
with clients, and the very fact that you have an e-mail address conveys a positive image for your
law firm.

<p>Having a hypertext link on your Home Page for prospective clients to use to contact your firm via
e-mail can be an especially effective avenue for communicating with new clients.  For some
clients, contacting a lawyer directly over the phone can be an intimidating experience.  Using e-mail, however, may not be, and it allows them to clearly explain their basic legal problem in a
short e-mail letter.  You can then get back with them to get more information, and schedule a
personal consultation in your office.  Keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not are a
medium where people are used to paying for information.  If an answer to a question cannot be
provided quickly and without research, then you are probably better off providing a simple
response and asking the individual to schedule a consultation.  In addition, you have the problem
of whether or not an attorney-client relationship has been established merely by your e-mail
exchange.  Consequently, most e-mail use should be with existing clients, rather than prospective
clients who are responding to your Home Page.  In addition, any new client contacts via e-mail
should be accompanied by a warning that the e-mail exchange by itself does not create an
attorney-client relationship.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=SECURITY>IV.  SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONCERNS</A></strong>

<p>It has been said that security on the Internet is an oxymoron.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  It is certainly true that the
Internet is not a secure environment for transmitting information.  E-mail is less secure than a
telephone conversation or a fax transmission.  An e-mail transmission is somewhat similar to
sending mail on a postcard, in that a limited number of people can come in contact with your
message and read it.  People with access to your e-mail include your Internet Service Provider
and other system administrators that help operate the network.  This is, however, not too different
from the potential danger of cellular phone calls being intercepted by casual eavesdroppers with a
radio scanner.  In both cases you need to be aware of the possibility of someone reading or
listening to your private message, but the reality is that the shear volume of traffic lessens the
likelihood of any serious breach of security.  While this may not be a big concern for most of the
information you may end up sending via e-mail, as a lawyer you have a special duty of
confidentiality to your clients which means that you must evaluate whether to send e-mail which
could contain confidential information.  One possible solution is to use some of the very effective
cryptographic software which is available, and will allow you to send e-mail with complete
confidence that it is secure.  One example is a very powerful piece of shareware called Pretty
Good Privacy (PGP), which was developed in 1991 by Philip Zimmerman.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>  PGP requires two
encryption codes, or keys, one private and one public, to encrypt and decrypt messages.  The
sender of the mail can use the recipient's public key to encrypt a piece of e-mail.  A secret key
only accessible by the recipient can be used to decipher the message.  For information on where
you can get the shareware version of the PGP software you can check out their Web site at 

<p>(   http://draco.centerline.com:8080/~franl/pgp/where-to-get-pgp.html   ).  In principle it is a very
simple process, but in practice it can be more than a little bit of trouble since a public key code
can be more than 250 characters in length.  Nonetheless, if you intend to send confidential client
information via e-mail, encryption is the only secure method.

<p>Another security concern worth mentioning is the possibility of getting a computer virus by
downloading some software off the Internet.  While this is a valid concern, it's not much of a
problem to counter with the advent of computer virus scanning software on the market now, that
will detect any such virus and allow you to erase it before it can do any harm.     

<p>Another concern that many people might have about getting connected to the Internet is due to
the fact that the Internet is a two-way street.  It allows you to use your computer to go into and
explore cyberspace, but it also creates a potential pathway for some hacker to gain unauthorized
access to your own computer, and all of the files stored thereon.  However, this is only a potential
problem if you set up a server<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> on the Internet, where your desktop computer is connected to
the Internet all the time.  Just accessing the Internet on your PC doesn't open up your hard drive
for all the world to look into.  And if you are interested in having a full time connection to the
Internet via your own server and full time bridge, you can still protect your files by using
appropriate firewall<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> security software to prevent unauthorized access.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=CLIENT>V.  OTHER CLIENT GETTING TECHNIQUES AND PITFALLS</A></strong>

<p>Another important aspect of the Internet to be aware of is the existence of numerous Usenet news
groups.  Essentially, a Usenet is a network based protocol which acts as a sort of electronic
bulletin board.  People who want to use these Usenet news groups post messages to an individual
news group, or series of related groups, and others are free to read these comments and add
comments of their own.  Each of the 10,000+ news groups currently in circulation tend to focus
on a particular subject, which is usually pretty narrow.  The Usenet can provide a valuable
medium for discourse on various subjects, and there are a number of these groups which focus on
various legal issues. 

<p>When using these Usenet news groups, it is important to realize that there are certain traditions
which have arisen in the course of developing the Internet.  Collectively, they form a type of
social etiquette.  Ignoring these conventions may not be against the law, but it can result in the
vilification of the transgressor.  The most famous example of this was the 1993 "spamming" of
the Usenet by two immigration lawyers in Arizona.  The term "spamming" derives from a skit in
Monty Python's Flying Circus where Spam is included in each and every dish on a restaurant
menu.  The lawyers in this incident posted, to each and every one of the 10,000+ news groups on
the Usenet, a note advertising their services in connection with an immigration "lottery".  While
this might appear innocuous enough, the problem is that keeping news groups properly focused
has been a long-time concern and most users become quite upset when a note is posted which
clearly falls outside the subject matter of the group. 

<p>Exacerbating the problem was the intransigent reaction of the lawyers when advised they had
broken the unwritten rules of the Usenet.  As a result, enraged Internet denizens began the
electronic equivalent of guerilla warfare.  People around the world began to send "electronic
mailbombs" (messages of such enormous length that they clog the user's mail account).  These
messages were so large and numerous that they actually caused a failure of the Internet Service
Provider's network, and subsequent service failure for all other customers of that service
provider.  The service provider was forced to retaliate by cutting off Internet access to the
lawyers in a desperate bid to distance itself from the transgressors as well as restore service to
other customers.  Others began researching the lawyers' background, and one enterprising fellow
posted a public record of past disciplinary proceedings which had been taken by a state bar
association against one of the lawyers.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  To make matters worse, the lawyers were completely
unrepentant, and tried to argue that they were not breaking any laws, and were completely within
there rights to make commercial postings to these various news groups.  After a series of
postings, and retaliatory e-mail flamings, a hacker in Norway developed a "cancelbot" program
that would look for messages from these "Green Card lawyers" and automatically delete them
from any network discussion groups they might show up in.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

<p>The message here should be pretty clear.  The Internet can be a powerful business tool, but it
does not serve any professional or business interest to abuse the network in a manner which is
bound to cause controversy, and provide a basis for further vilification of lawyers.

<p>Other specific examples of Netiquette applicable to operating on News groups, sending e-mail,
and use of the world wide web in general are detailed in <u>The Lawyer's Guide to Marketing on the
Internet</u>, by Gregory H. Siskind and Timothy J. Moses, published by the ABA.  Another good
source of information on Netiquette and Internet Rules of the road can be found on the Internet at
( http://rs6000.adm.fau.edu/rinaldi/net/index.htm ).  Both of these are very good sources of
information which anyone considering advertising on the Internet, or just using the Internet,
would be advised to read.

<p>  

<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=WARNING>VI.  WARNING: THE USE OF THE INTERNET CAN BE HABIT FORMING</A></strong>

<p>While the Internet can be a tremendous asset to a law firm, its uncontrolled use can also be a
tremendous waste of valuable time.  Allowing employee's unsupervised access to the Internet has
been restricted by some companies because employee productivity was declining due to the non-job related Cyber-Surfing.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>  Consequently, any law firm that plans to get there individual
attorneys and employees connected to the Internet should consider setting strict guidelines that
prohibit non-job related research on the Internet, as well as possible monitoring of Internet use to
insure compliance.  

<p>Another cautionary note to consider is that while most of the information on the Internet is free,
it's not necessarily as efficient and user friendly as commercial on-line legal services such as
Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis.  Consequently, just Cyber-Surfing for legal information can end up
being very time consuming and thus prohibitively expensive in terms of non-billable employee
time.  On the other hand, if you already have specific Web Sites book marked for quick access,
the Internet can be a quick and valuable tool in your total research scheme.  As with any new
system, initial start up, in terms of time and effort in learning how to use the Internet, can be
costly, but ultimately, if properly planned and implemented, the Internet can be a valuable source
of legal information and potential clients.

<p>One very good source of legal sites to visit on the Internet is the "Law Lists" put out by Lyonette
Louis-Jacques.  A copy of this list is published in <u>The Lawyer's Guide to the Internet</u>, by G.
Burgess Allison which is published by the ABA.  You can also get this list off the Internet from
the Lawyers Cooperative Publishing company which now publishes this list and provides a direct
link to the list from there Home page at ( http://www.lcp.com ).  Another listing of law related
Web sites is also provided by the ABA at their Home page at ( http://www.abanet.org  ) which
has a LAWlink which will give you a very comprehensive listing of legal sources that are only a
mouse click away.  The ABA Home page is an especially diverse source of legal information,
and even has its own search engine, Excite for Web Servers, which allows you to do a key word
search to find specific topics or information within this very large Web site.  Another source for a
variety of legal information sites is from the Lexis Counsel Connect Home page, 

<p>( http://lawschools.counsel.com/welcome.html  ).  <u>The Lawyer's Guide to the Internet</u> also
includes a listing of Government Documents on the Internet.  This listing of Web Sites can be an
extremely valuable source of free government information.  One example is that you can get the
Securities and Exchange Commission's electronic database of public filings, called EDGAR,
which is republished on the Internet, nightly, at no cost to users at ( ftp://town.hall.org:/edgar/ ). 
Other examples include federal labor law reports, documents and commentary on the Uniform
Commercial Code, Trademark Law, Patents, and more.  A number of law schools have also
developed extensive on-line library sources of legal information.  This includes the Case Western
Reserve University "Project Hermes" which since 1990 has been publishing all the US Supreme
Court decisions on-line for free ( ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ ).  Once you start exploring the
Internet you can find a number of extremely valuable sources of free information, and by listing
the URL address in your Bookmark file, you can quickly return to these sites when needed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=REGULATION>VII.  REGULATION OF ATTORNEY ADVERTISING ON THE INTERNET</A></strong>

<p>Another very important issue to consider when contemplating marketing on the Internet is
addressing the professional responsibility issues, and complying with your local Bar Associations
rules on advertising.  Professional responsibility rules relating to advertising were written to
cover the various concerns of print, radio and television advertising, rather than the unique
environment of the Internet.  However, a number of State Bar's have, or are contemplating,
specific guidelines and restrictions on advertising on the Internet.  The State Bar of Texas'
announcement last fall was followed by the Florida Bar's announcement this past spring that they
would charge lawyers a $50.00 fee for posting information on the Internet via a Home Page, and
both of these jurisdictions established specific advertising guidelines for the Internet.  The
application of a states' Rules of Professional Conduct to attorney communications on the Internet
is a natural extension of the Bar's authority to regulate attorney advertising and solicitation, but
the unique characteristics of Internet communications does create some additional concerns.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>

<p>In Texas, the State Bar Association's Advertising Review Committee examined the issue of how
to monitor attorney advertising on the Internet during their meeting of January 7-8, 1996.  They
approved various interpretive comments concerning how Part 7 of the Texas Disciplinary Rules
of Professional Conduct will be applied to attorney advertising on the Internet.  In an effort to
clearly define advertising in an Internet context, the Committee issued Interpretive Comment 17,
which effectively designates the Home Page of a Web site as an advertisement per se, and
requires a mandatory filing with the Committee.  The Comment requires the filing of a hard copy
of the Home Page, and its URL address, and any subsequent changes or updates to the Home
Page itself.  In addition, any information that is offered beyond the first screen which is primarily
concerned with solicitation of prospective clients by a lawyer or law firm must also be submitted
for review.  The Comment then goes on to describe a variety of different types of information
that are not generally considered to be solicitations, and are, therefore, exempt from the hard
copy filing requirement.  These exempt categories include newsletters; news articles; legal
articles; editorial opinions; illustrations; questionnaires; fact or opinion survey forms;
announcements of office openings and relocations; requests for proposals or information from
the public; legal product specifications; e-mail and e-mail response forms; attorney biographical
information; announcements or personnel changes; attorney and support staff recruiting; job
openings; legal developments, and events such as verdicts, judgments, court rulings,
administrative rulings, and/or legislation; announcements of seminars and events (including
online registration forms for these events); links to other Internet sites (legal or otherwise); and
entertainment/amusement devices.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>

<p>This appears to be a reasonable degree of regulation which allows the Committee to monitor
attorney advertising on the Internet without creating an undue burden on attorneys who wish to
advertise with a Home Page.  It is particularly reasonable in that only the initial screen of the
Home Page needs to be forwarded to the Committee for review.  Since this initial screen
generally does not have to be updated, at least not in any material way, this should not be a
particular burden to anyone wanting to use this advertising media.  Most of the changes and
updates will be on the following screens where a law firm may be frequently changing its
newsletter, attorney biographical information, and the like.  Under the Committee's current view,
these changes would not have to be forwarded for review at all, as long as they were not
primarily concerned with solicitation.

<p>It is important to note that the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct and Comment
17 only addresses advertising on the Internet via a Home Page.  It does not attempt to address
other forms of Internet advertising, such as the posting of ads with news groups, like the Green
Card spamming incident previously described.  However, in addition to such news group
advertising being a violation of Netiquette, it is also clearly subject to Texas Rule 7.04, as an
advertisement in the public media.  As such it would also require a filing with the Committee, the
paying of a $50.00 fee for the initial filing, record keeping, and the appropriate disclaimers
required under Rule 7.    

<p>In Florida the new guidelines appear to track very closely with those in Texas.  Like Texas, only
the first screen of the Home Page is required to be approved by the Committee, and like Texas,
there is a $50.00 fee for the initial filing and any updates.  The apparent logic with only the initial
Home Page screen requiring Committee review is that any information behind the home page
must be affirmatively requested by the potential client and, therefore, can not be considered
unsolicited advertising.  When the Florida Bar published their guidelines for attorney Home
Pages on the Internet they stated that "an Internet home page or web site posted by a lawyer or
law firm is considered advertising and, as such, must comply with the applicable lawyer
advertising regulations as set forth in Rules 4-7.1 through 4-7.8 regulating The Florida Bar."<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>   

<p>While Texas and Florida are the only states to specifically regulate, and charge a fee for lawyer
advertising on the Internet, it is very likely that most of the remaining states will follow suit as
more and more lawyers venture out into this new advertising media.  There are already six other
states actively considering the implementation of specific Internet advertising guidelines.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>

<p>One unique ethical problem that is created by advertising on the Internet is the restriction that a
firm cannot advertise in states where none of its lawyers are licensed.  Since an Internet Home
Page can reach a global audience this potentially poses a huge problem for attorney advertising. 
This issue hasn't really been addressed by any bar associations, and many people would argue
that this Web site situation is comparable to an ad in a local newspaper which might be read by
someone in a different state, and would not be considered to be an unauthorized practice of law
violation.  Nonetheless, one possible solution would be to include a statement in the Web site
advertisement that the lawyer or firm is only licensed in a particular State and only provides
services to people seeking advice with respect to the laws of that State, thereby making it clear
that the firm does not intend to practice in States where it is not licensed.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>  <strong></strong>

<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=CONCLUSION>VIII.  CONCLUSION</strong>

<p>The Internet is the wave of the future, and unless you want to be washed away by this
technological tsunami you had better start learning how to surf.  The Internet has a lot to offer
practicing lawyers in terms of potential for advertising, communications, and legal research. 
While it is not the only tool that a practicing attorney should have, it is becoming increasingly
evident that it is an essential tool for those attorneys who want their law firms to grow and
prosper in the next century.

<p>Using the Internet as an advertising media, by establishing and maintaining a Home page for your
law firm, can be a very effective and relatively inexpensive means of attracting new clients and
keeping your current clients informed.  By taking the technological plunge of designing and
posting your own Home page you can keep costs to a minimum, and make sure that your Web
site is a current and comprehensive reflection of your law firm.

<p>As an attorney you have a number of ethical and professional responsibilities to consider when
advertising on the Internet.  The two State Bar Associations, Texas and Florida, who have taken
the steps to specifically regulate attorney advertising on the Internet have both established
reasonable requirements and guidelines to follow.  It seems likely that most, if not all, of the
remaining jurisdictions will eventually establish similar formal requirements for advertising on
the Internet, as use of this new advertising media by attorneys continues to increase.

<p>As we approach the beginning of the next century, attorneys who may be wavering on whether or
not to get involved with the Internet need to consider the fact that the Information Super
Highway is already under construction, and they are going to either be part of the steamroller, or
part of the pavement.

<p align="center"><A NAME=CRYPTOGRAPHY>I.  Cryptography and the Internet</A>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In contemporary society the electronic medium is providing a forum for a wide variety of
transactions and communications.  Many of these transactions and communications are meant to
be kept private, the contents of which are intended only for the designated recipient to be privy
to. The Internet has created a new high-tech forum for electronic communications and electronic
fund transfers.  Electronic communications on the Internet include commercial transactions,
securities trading, and government electronic communications.  However, the Internet will only
be viable as a tool for commercial transactions and electronic fund transfers if such transactions
can be done securely.  

<p>One report by the Office of Technology Assessment reveals that, "The average number of
electronic point-of-sale transactions in the United States went from 38 per day in 1985 to 1.2
million per day in 1993.  An average of $800 billion is transferred among partners in
international currency markets every day; about $1trillion is transferred daily among, U.S. banks;
and an average of $2 trillion worth of securities are traded daily in New York markets.  Nearly all
of these financial transactions pass over information networks."<sup></sup><a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
<p>  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>However, electronic medium is a forum that is highly vulnerable to the uninvited "guest" who
may have an interest in your private communication or transaction and may attempt to intercept. 
The vulnerabilities of the electronic medium make it impossible to guarantee that third parties
will not be able to intercept private communications.  The most vulnerable forum in which the
interception of transactions may occur is the NII, otherwise known as the Internet.  The rapidly
expanding number of transactions on the Internet has spawned the need for a secure  means of
conducting such transactions.  This need for security has subsequently resulted in the wide spread
public and commercial use of cryptography, a tool which has traditionally been used only by
government agencies.  Simply put, cryptography is the science of securing data through the use
crytposystems.  A cryptosystem is a method of rendering data illegible to everyone but the
intended recipient who can "unlock" the data with a special key.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=HISTORY>II.  History of Cryptography</A> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The word cryptography is derived from the Greek words "kryptos," that translates to "hidden,"
and "graphia," that translates to "writing."<sup></sup><a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
<p>  Webster's New World Dictionary defines
cryptography as, "the art of writing or deciphering messages in code."<sup></sup><a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
<p>  The application of
cryptography is not a new one.  In fact, cryptography dates as far back as 4000 years ago when it
was used by the Egyptians and the Phoenicians.<sup></sup><a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>
<p>  Furthermore, historians have traced the use of
cryptography by historical greats such as Julius Caesar, Mary, Queen of Scotts, and Abraham
Lincoln.<sup></sup><a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>Abraham Lincoln made use of cryptography in the United States army during the Civil War.<sup></sup><a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>
<p> 
Julius Caesar implemented a complex form of cryptography into his military documents by
replacing each character of a word with a letter three spaces beyond it in the alphabet.<sup></sup><a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
<p>  During
World War II, the Germans developed an elaborate system of cryptography using the ENIGMA
machine which was eventually cracked, or decrypted, by the British through Project Ultra.<sup></sup><a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
<p> 
Around 1900, mechanical cryptosystems systems began to be developed and it was around 1950
that computer cryptosystems began to appear.<sup></sup><a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>
<p>  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=HOW>III.  How Cryptography Works</A>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Cryptography has become an important and essential tool for both the public and commercial
sectors due to the emergence of the Internet.  Cryptography is a process of securing data through
the use of mathematical algorithms.  The data in its original form is referred to as plaintext. 
Through the use of a cryptosystem the plaintext is transformed into an illegible format called
ciphertext.  Generally, cryptography works by transforming plaintext into an unorganized
collection of various characters and symbols called ciphertext that disguises the original content
of the message.  There are two essential elements that are found in every modern cryptosystem. 
The first element is the mathematical algorithm used to develop the particular cryptosystem.  The
second element is the type of key that is used to both lock and unlock the data. 

<p>The cryptographic key is part of a two-step process which makes cryptography effective as an
information security tool.  First, data must be encrypted, which is the process of transforming the
plaintext into ciphertext.  The key is used lock the encrypted the data.  The data in its encrypted
form is referred to as a ciphergram.  Second, the ciphertext is decrypted, which is the process of
returning the ciphertext back into its original, plaintext, form.  The key is used to unlock the data
so that it may be decrypted.  The key is an integral part to the effectiveness of the cryptosystem
and as such if must be kept secret and safely secured.     

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=VULNERABILITIES>IV.  Vulnerabilities of Cryptographic Systems</A>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Third parties who may try to break the cryptosystem are referred to as enemies, crackers,
eavesdroppers, and opponents.<sup></sup><a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>
<p>  An attempt to break a cryptosystem is referred to as an attack. 
The use of various types of attacks that may be used by unauthorized third parties to break a
cryptosystem is generally referred to as cryptoanalysis.<sup></sup><a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>Several types of attacks include the use of a brute-force search, cribs, and isologs.  To perform a
brute-force search the third party must have both the plaintext and ciphertext versions of a
message.  The third party will then try encrypting the plaintext with every possible key until the
resulting ciphertext matches the ciphertext that is being attacked.  Once the third party
successfully creates an identical ciphertext then the identity of the requisite key needed to decrypt
the ciphertext becomes known and the data is no longer secure to that third party.  

<p>Another type of cryptoanalysis is the use of cribs.  Cribs are assumed stretches of probable
plaintext that may be found within a ciphergram.  The third party will look for potential cribs
and, if successful, may interpret enough of the ciphertext to be able to interpret the whole
message.  Similarly, a third party may try to used isologs to decipher data. Isologs are identical
plaintext that may be found in other ciphergrams or keys.  If the isologs are successfully
identified and matched, then a third party may be able to successfully attack portions of the
ciphertext or even the whole ciphergram.

<p>The types of cryptosystems that are the most resistant to attacks are referred to as strong
cryptosystems.  The relative strength of any cryptosystem is primarily dependent on the length of
the key used and the complexity of the mathematical algorithm.<sup></sup><a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>
<p>  However, a strong
cryptosystem is based more on the security of the key rather than the mathematical algorithm
used to create the cryptosystem.<sup></sup><a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>
<p>  The computing power required to successfully attack a
cryptosystem increases exponentially with the length of the key.<sup></sup><a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>
<p>  The longer the key size is in
bits, then the harder it becomes to successfully attack a cryptosystem.<sup></sup><a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>
<p>  The following is an
example of the computing power needed to successfully attack a cryptosystem:  

<p>If using brute force to try all keys . . . a 32 bit key takes 2<sup>32</sup> (about 10<sup>9</sup>) steps.  This is something
any amateur can do on his/her home computer.  A system with 40 bit keys (e.g. US-exportable
version of RC4) takes 20<sup>40</sup> steps - this kind of computing is available in most universities and
even smallish companies.  A system with 56 bit keys (such as DES) takes a substantial effort, but
is quit easily breakable with special hardware.  The cost of the special hardware is substantial but
easily within reach of organized criminals, major companies, and lesser governments in a few
years.  Keys with 80 bits may become breakable in the future.  Keys with 128 bits will probably
remain unbreakable by brute force for the foreseeable future.<sup></sup><a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>
<p> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=KEYS>V.	Cryptographic Keys</A>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Cryptographic keys are used to both encrypt and decrypt data.  A key is used to encrypt data by
inputting the key into the algorithm and then applying the resulting code to the data that is to be
encrypted.  The data is then decrypted by reapplying the key and the algorithm to the ciphergram,
thereby transforming it back into plaintext.  The key can be the same for both the encryption and
decryption of data.  This is referred to as a single-key cryptosystem, secret-key, or symmetric
algorithm.  However, the strongest cryptosystems in use today use asymmetrical algorithms. 
Cryptosystems that are based on an asymmetrical algorithm use a set of keys called a private key
and a public-key to encrypt and decrypt the data.  Generally, the plaintext is encrypted with the
public-key and then decrypted with the private key.  This is also referred to as public-key
cryptosystem.  

<p>Regardless of the type of cryptography used the encrypted data will be useless to all but those
with the appropriate key.  A key is composed of a certain number of bits called the keylength or
keyspace.  For today's security standards, the current minimum length of a key should be 56-bits. 
However, the most effective contemporary cryptosystem use 128-bit keys which are considered
to be almost unbreakable.  For example, Netscape claims that its 128-bit cryptosystem requires
309 septillion more times computing power to successfully attack over its 40-bit cryptosystem
which has been successfully cracked by third parties.<sup></sup><a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>
<p>  Key lengths longer than 40-bits in length
fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. State Department and cannot be exported outside the
United States.<sup></sup><a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>
<p>    

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=SINGLE>VI  Single-key Cryptographic Systems</A>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The science of cryptography is one that is constantly evolving, resulting in cryptosystems that are
more reliable, easier to use, and more secure.  The least secure type of cryptosystem is single-key
cryptography which works much like a password or personal identification number (PIN).<sup></sup><a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>
<p>  
Simply type in the right code and the ciphergram will be decrypted.  There are several inherent
flaws with single-key encryption which have inhibited its efficiency as an effective security tool.  

<p>The first problem stems from the fact that both the sender of the message and the recipient must
have the one password needed to decrypt the message.  This mandates a relationship of trust that
may not necessarily be realistic in the Internet environment where the sender and recipient
usually do not know each other.  Many secure transactions on the Internet are first encounter
transactions with people who are completely unfamiliar with each other.  Therefore, it is
impossible to have the requisite level of trust needed to conduct a secure transaction when both
parties have the secret password necessary to decrypt the message.<sup></sup><a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>
<p>  The password's secrecy
may be compromised without the other party's knowledge thereby rendering the encrypted data
vulnerable to anyone who should end up with the password.  The second problem is the actual
transmission of the requisite password key to the other party.<sup></sup><a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>
<p>  This problem becomes
increasingly manifest in transactions on the Internet involving parties who are unfamiliar with
each other.<sup></sup><a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>
<p>  Another problem with single-key cryptography is the storage and security of the
key itself.   

<p>Contemporary types of single-key cryptosystem are DES, Skipjack, RC2, and RC4.<sup></sup><a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>
<p>  DES,
Data Encryption Standard, was developed in a joint effort by IBM and the National Security
Agency in 1974.<sup></sup><a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>
<p>  In 1977, DES was adopted as a Federal Information Processing Standard.<sup></sup><a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>
<p> 
The DES algorithm is based on 64-bit blocks of data and uses a 56-bit randomly generated key
from a total of 256 different keys.<sup></sup><a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>The U.S. government has been criticized for the DES keylength.<sup></sup><a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>
<p>  Critics claim that the key is
just long enough to prevent attacks by corporations but just short enough to be vulnerable to
attacks by National Security Agency should they need to break through encrypted information.<sup></sup><a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>
<p> 
The government advocates the need to be able to get through to encrypted material in criminal
and terrorists investigations.<sup></sup><a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>
<p>  The Japanese company, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp.,
has begun to market what is called Triple DES cryptosystem.<sup></sup><a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>
<p>  The Triple DES cryptosystem
creates a symmetrical algorithm that has a keylength that is 112-bits long and that is theoretically
unbreakable.<sup></sup><a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Because the criticism that the DES cryptosystem is too weak, the U.S. government has proposed
another controversial type of cryptosystem called the Escrowed Encryption Standard that uses the
Skipjack algorithm.  The cryptosystem is commonly referred to as the Clipper Chip Initiative and
was announced on, April 16, 1993, by President Clinton.  The Skipjack algorithm that is "used in
the Clipper Chip is 16 million times stronger than existing encryption chips and it would take a
super-computer more than a billion years to crack one Clipper encryption key."<sup></sup><a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>
<p>  Despite the
strong Skipjack algorithm, the Clipper Chip is the subject of heated debate because of the
government's "back door." The "back door" in the Clipper Chip is based on the concept that the
government would be given a copy of every chip's public and private key.  This would
effectively give the government access to all messages that are encrypted using the Clipper Chip. 
Additionally, Matthew Blaze of Bell Labs discovered a flaw in the Clipper Chip that would
"allow a user to circumvent a law enforcement agency's ability to decipher a message."<sup></sup><a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>The US government has responded by launching its new initiative, dubbed "Clipper 3," which
would give users the benefit of being able to identify the party that they are communicating with

<p>  However, the controversy rages on because, just like the
original Clipper Chip, the government would have access to users'  private and public-keys.<sup></sup><a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>

<p align="center"><A NAME=PUBLIC>VII.  Public-key Cryptographic Systems</A>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As a result of the inherent security problems with single-key cryptography, public-key
cryptography was developed in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman.<sup></sup><a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>
<p>  They both
worked at Stanford University where Whitfield Diffie worked as a computer scientist and
mathematician and Martin Hellman as a professor of electrical engineering.<sup></sup><a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>
<p>  They published a
paper known as the Diffie-Hellman Proposal that explained the theory of splitting the
cryptography key, thereby opening the door for the development of public-key cryptosystem.<sup></sup><a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>Martin Hellman describes public-key cryptography as, "every user has two keys, a public one and
a private one, that are unique to their owner. Whatever is scrambled by one key can be
unscrambled by the other."<sup></sup><a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>
<p>  He further explains that, "for complicated mathematical reasons, it
is possible to distribute one's public-key freely without compromising security; a potential
enemy will have no advantage in code-cracking if he holds your public-key alone."<sup></sup><a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>
<p>  Each
person will have two keys.  One key is published publicly while the other key is the private key
which is kept secret and should never be transmitted.  The security of this cryptographic system
can only be rendered ineffective through the compromise of one's private key or by being
cracked by an unauthorized person. 

<p>Dr. Ronald Rivest, the creator of the popular single-key cryptosystems RC2 and RC4, was one of
three professors from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who developed the first public-key cryptosystem, RSA.  The three professors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adelman,
developed the RSA algorithm in 1977 based on the theories presented in the Diffie-Hellman
Proposal.<sup></sup><a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>
<p>  The name of the RSA algorithm is derived from the first initial of the last names of
the three inventors.<sup></sup><a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>
<p>  RSA based algorithms are becoming the standard for contemporary
public-key cryptosystems.<sup></sup><a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The most popular and widely used type of public-key cryptosystem is Pretty Good Privacy
(PGP).<sup></sup><a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>
<p>  The PGP cryptosystem is composed of both the International Data Encryption
Algorithm (IDEA) and the RSA algorithm.<sup></sup><a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>
<p>  It was developed by Philip Zimmerman in 1991
and was subsequently placed on the Internet for public access by a friend of his.<sup></sup><a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>
<p>     

<p>Public-key encryption uses a mathematical process known as a trap-door one-way function.<sup></sup><a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>
<p>  A
normal one-way function is a mathematical process that is easy to perform one way as when
encrypting a message but is difficult to perform in the other direction as when decrypting data.<sup></sup><a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>
<p> 
A trap-door one-way function makes it easy to perform the mathematical function in both ways if
the requisite information necessary to invoke the trap door is provided.<sup></sup><a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>
<p>  The public-key is used
in the forward direction to encrypt the data and for signature verification, while the private key is
used in the inverse direction to decrypt the data and signature generation.<sup></sup><a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>
<p>  The RSA
cryptosystem works as follows:

<p>Take two large primes, p and q, and find their product n = pq: n is called the modulus.  Choose a
number, e, less than n and relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1), which that e and (p-1)(q-1) have no
common factors except 1.  Find another number d such that (ed - 1) is divisible by (p - 1)(q - 1). 
The values e and d are called the public and private exponents, respectively.  The public-key is
the pair (n,e): the private key is (n,d).  The factors p and q may be kept with the private key, or
destroyed . . . . It is difficult (presumably) to obtain the private key d from the public-key (n,e).  If
one could factor n into p and q, however, then one could obtain the private key d.  Thus the
security of RSA is related to the assumption that factoring is difficult.  An easy factoring method
or some other feasible attack would "break" RSA.<sup></sup><a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=COMBINED>VIII.  Combined use of Single-key and Public-key Cryptographic Systems</A>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Public-key cryptography has not signaled the end of the single-key cryptosystem.  In fact, the
public-key cryptosystem is dependent upon the combined use of both public-key and  single-key
cryptosystem.  This method involves the encryption of plaintext using a single-key cryptosystem
and then securing the password key, or session-key, with a public-key cryptosystem.  Thus, a
message is first encrypted with single-key cryptosystem.  Next, the session-key is encrypted using
a public-key cryptosystem with the recipient's public-key.  The session key can then can only be
decrypted with the recipient's private key, to which only the recipient should have access.  Using
a public-key cryptosystem to encrypt a session key is called a digital envelope.<sup></sup><a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>The reason for using both public-key and single-key cryptosystems in conjunction with one
another is the because of the difference in the speed between two cryptographic systems.  Single-key cryptography is very fast thereby making it a practical and efficient cryptosystem with which
to secure data.  On the other hand, public-key cryptography is very slow because of the
complexity of the mathematical calculations.  The slow speed of public-key cryptography renders
its use impractical as an efficient cryptosystem for securing large amounts of data.  Thus, the
strengths of the two cryptographic systems compensate for the other's weakness, thereby forming
a cryptographic system that is both effective and efficient.    

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=SIGNATURES>IX.	Digital Signatures</A>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Public-key cryptography is also very important because it provides a method to sign electronic
documents in a digital form called a digital signature.  A digital signature works by using a
computation of the message digest.  A timestamp may also be included with the computation to
verify exactly when the document is signed.  The actual digital signature is formed when the
sender encrypts the computation of the message digest with his private key.  The message itself is
encrypted with the recipient's public-key so that only the recipient can decrypt the message by
using the recipient's own private key.  

<p>A cryptographic hash function is often used to create a hash value for the message digest. 
Because of the complexity of the one-way hash algorithm it is nearly impossible to come up with
matching hash values for a message that has been altered.  "Cryptographic hash functions
typically produce hash values of 128 bits or longer.  This number is vastly larger than the number
of different messages likely to ever be exchanged in the world."<sup></sup><a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>The digital signature provides three important attributes to a document secured through public-key encryption.<sup></sup><a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>
<p>  First, a digital signature serves to prove the authenticity of the signing
party.<sup></sup><a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>
<p>Authentication of the sender's identity can be confirmed with a digital signature
because the sender uses his private key to encrypt the hash value and only the sender would have
access to that private key.  This procedure also prevents the second problem of repudiation by the
sending party.<sup></sup><a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>Repudiation of a contract occurs when one party to the contract disclaims the obligations
imposed upon him by the terms of the contractual obligation.<sup></sup><a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a>
<p>  This problem is especially
manifest in electronic contracts where parties often conduct an entire transaction via the
Internet.<sup></sup><a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>
<p>  Typical claims for repudiation of an electronic agreement include forgery of a digital
signature, denial of offer and acceptance, and contract-interpretation disputes.<sup></sup><a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>
<p>  Forgery of a
digital signature secured with a hash code is theoretically not possible because a hash value is
nearly impossible to duplicate.  The use of a hash code also prevents a third party from being able
to transfer a digital signature from one document to another as the hash values would not match
for the two documents. 

<p>Third, a digital signature serves to prove that the document was not altered since it was signed
thereby verifying the integrity of a digitally signed document.<sup></sup><a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>
<p>  The integrity of a document is
tested by the hash function.  If the hash value computed by the recipient matches the encrypted
hash value from the sender, then the integrity of the message is verified.  However, if the two
hash values are different then the document that was sent is not exactly the same as the document
received.  The following is an example of how a digital signature works to accomplish the three
purposes detailed above:

<p>Alice the sender wants to digitally sign a message, Alice applies her sender's private key.  When
Bob the recipient wants to authenticate the origin of the message (i.e., from Alice), Bob applies
the sender's public-key (Alice's public-key).  This accomplishes the two security services of
authentication (who sent the message) and non-repudiation (who is estopped from denying the
message).  

<p>In addition, when in digital signature mode, the security service of message integrity is
simultaneously accomplished, so that it is certain that Alices's message has not been altered since
it was digitally signed by Alice.  Every character in Alice's message is run through a one-way
hash algorithm.  The hash result is then encrypted by applying the public-key of Bob, the
recipient.  When Bob authenticates the origin of the message as coming from Alice, Bob also
verifies the integrity of the message by (I) applying his won (Bob the recipient's) private key to
decrypt the transmitted hash result; and (ii) comparing the decrypted hash result with a second
hash result which Bob the recipient himself prepares from the transmitted message.<sup></sup><a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=RELATIVE>X.  Relative Strength of Cryptographic Systems and Government Regulation</A>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The United States government regulates the export of cryptosystems through the U.S. State
Department.<sup></sup><a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>
<p>  The export of cryptosystems is regulated by the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR) under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).<sup></sup><a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a>
<p>  ITAR
regulations deem that all cryptosystems that are composed of cryptographic keys that are longer
than 40 bits are munitions and are thus prohibited from export out of the United States.<sup></sup><a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a>
<p>  The
State Department's position has been supported by the recent case, <u>Karn v. Department of
State</u>.<sup></sup><a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>
<p>  In <u>Karns</u> the Court held that export controls apply to encryption because a cryptographic
algorithm is a defense article subject to control by the executive branch.<sup></sup><a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a>
<p>  However, another
recent case, <u>Berstein v. Department of State</u>, held that cryptographic algorithms are not munitions
and are thus not subject to export controls.<sup></sup><a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>Congress has taken a less restrictive view of cryptographic systems and has had three bills
introduced that would limit the government's export controls.<sup></sup><a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>
<p>  Senator Conrad Burns
introduced the Pro-Code bill, Senator Patick Leahy introduced Senate Bill 1587, and
Representative Robert Goodlatte introduced H.R. 3011.<sup></sup><a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>
<p>  All three bills are similar in that they
would make it easier to export cryptographic systems, uphold American's right to use
cryptographic systems of their choice without key escrow, and make it a crime to use
cryptography to obstruct law enforcement investigations into felony offenses.<sup></sup><a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>
<p>    

<p>The main argument for ensuring the promulgation of strong cryptographic systems is that
cryptosystems are not unbreakable.  In fact the only form of cryptography that is truly
unbreakable is the cipher called the one-time pad, as proved by a famous mathematician, Claude
Shannon, in 1949.<sup></sup><a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a>
<p>  The drawback to the one-time pad is that a key may be used only once and
then it is thrown away.<sup></sup><a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>
<p>  The result is that the effectiveness of the one-time pad cryptosystem is
compromised by its inefficiency.  Furthermore, public-key cryptographic systems are based on
the unproved theory that public-key functions are strictly one-way functions.<sup></sup><a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>
<p>  If an algorithm
was developed that allowed public-key functions to be computed in the inverse, without the use
of a trap door, then public-key cryptographic systems would be rendered useless.<sup></sup><a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>Two recent studies both encourage the promulagation of strong cryptographic systems.  First, an
eighteen month study by the National Research Council concluded that, "escrowed encryption, in
which the government would hold a mathematical key to unlock codes, requires further study
because it poses liability risks and introduces weakenesses into information protection
systems."<sup></sup><a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a>
<p>  Finally, a report released by a blue-ribbon campaign states that export controls of
cryptographic systems actually threatens national security because it deprives corporate America
of the necessary level of protection needed to prevent computer hackers from gaining access to
sensitive information.<sup></sup><a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>Regardless of your positon on the controversial issues surrounding the use of cryptography, there
is one common conclusion that everyone agrees with; in contemporary society the use of
cryptography is essential to the growth of the electronic medium as a forum for commercial
transactions, electronic banking, contractual transactions, and electronic messages.

<p>The online movement in home computing is changing the way America does business: from
personal banking to shopping, entertainment to information, cyberspace has opened up
completely new areas for the creative businessman to tap into new markets. This is particularly
true of securities markets. Cyberspace has opened up new, more efficient ways for businesses to
reach investors, and for investors to obtain information about and actually invest in businesses.
Therefore, although current rules apply to any securities transaction conducted in cyberspace, the
Securities and Exchange Commission has moved to offer guidance in the use of this new
medium.

<p align="center"><A NAME=INTRODUCTION>I. INTRODUCTION</A>

<p>While it is possible to use cyberspace technology to conduct many types of securities activities,
two areas of securities transactions are receiving particular notice from the SEC. Electronic filing
and delivery of documents is one area that has been addressed by the SEC, covering both filings
required to be filed with the SEC by law, and also documents sent to investors. Another area of
securities law  that has recently come to be addressed by the SEC is the actual selling of
securities over the Internet and electronic bulletin board systems. However, other issues bear
mention as well, such as the registration of Internet offerings under both federal and state laws,
"testing the waters", and just how much information an issuer may make available on a home
page.

<p align="center"><A NAME=EDGAR>II. EDGAR</A>

<p>The emergence of electronic communication technology enabled people to send information
quickly, efficiently and cheaply. Recognizing the benefits to be gained by electronic
communication, the SEC established the EDGAR system. EDGAR, or Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval, is a database of all documents that must be filed with the
SEC.<sup></sup><a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
<p> Any potential investor may search the EDGAR database on the SEC's homepage on the
Worldwide Web at www.sec.gov. As of May 6, 1996, all filings with the SEC are required to be
filed electronically.<sup></sup><a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
<p> This includes initial public offerings, and third party filings such as
Schedule 13Ds and proxy materials. While this requirement only applies to domestic filers, many
foreign filers are also making their filings available on the Internet.<sup></sup><a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
<p> The purpose of the system
is to automate the dissemination of corporate information, thereby increasing the efficiency and
fairness of the securities markets.<sup></sup><a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>  The current EDGAR contract ends in January 1997, and the SEC plans to have a new system
that will be able to handle images and other data that the current ASCII system is not capable of
using.<sup></sup><a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
<p> There are three possible file formats for the new system. The most likely new format is
HTML, or hypertext markup language, but PDF, portable document format, is also a
possibility.<sup></sup><a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>
<p> An unlikely third option is to add tags and intelligence to ASCII.<sup></sup><a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>While all domestic filers now must file electronically, in certain cases the SEC may grant an
exemption from this requirement.<sup></sup><a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
<p> However, if a company does not receive an exemption and
files on paper, while the SEC will receive and process the filing, the company will not be allowed
to use forms S-2, S-3 and S-8<sup></sup><a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>
<p>. Also, the issuer will not be able to incorporate information by
refering to the filing.<sup></sup><a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>Certain elements with regards to the EDGAR system are voluntary. Forms 3, 4, 5, 144 and 13F
are as yet not required to be filed electronically, although an issuer may elect to do so.<sup></sup><a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>
<p> Further,
the SEC has encouraged all filers to set up a Compuserve mailbox account to receive electronic
notification of the acceptance or suspension of filings.<sup></sup><a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>
<p> Issuers without such a mailbox will be
notified by mail.<sup></sup><a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>The EDGAR rules apply only to filings that are required to be filed with the SEC.<sup></sup><a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>
<p> However,
many issuers have sought guidance from the SEC concerning the electronic delivery of
documents such as prospectuses, tender offer materials, and proxy or information statements to
security holders and potential investors. 

<p align="center"><A NAME=DELIVERY>III. ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS</A>

<p>Electronic delivery of information offers many benefits to both issuer and recipient, including
efficiency, speed and lower cost.<sup></sup><a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>
<p> Considering this, the SEC set out guidelines, effective
October 6, 1995, for the use of electronic media to deliver required information under the
Securities Act of 1933.  The guidelines only discuss the procedural aspects of electronic delivery
by or on behalf of issuers and third parties with repect to issuers.<sup></sup><a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>
<p> Certain paper-based rules are
modified to apply to electronic delivery, such as rules regarding font size, bold-face type, red ink,
graphics and mailing.<sup></sup><a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>
<p> The SEC believes that electronic delivery should be an equal alternative
to paper delivery, and states that any information which can be delivered in a paper format may
also be delivered electronically.<sup></sup><a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>
<p> But until electronic delivery is more common, issuers should
continue to make paper delivery available.<sup></sup><a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>The more important analysis is whether sufficient disclosure has has been made to satisfy the
requirements, not the medium used to deliver the information.<sup></sup><a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>
<p> To satisfy disclosure
requirements, the electronic medium must provide effective communication and be adequately
available to the party to whom disclosure is being made.<sup></sup><a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>
<p>  Delivery will be complete 
electronically if the intended recipient receives substantially the same information as he would
have through paper delivery and has the opportunity to retain a permanent copy of the
information.<sup></sup><a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>The SEC has put forth the following guidelines to satisfy delivery requirements, stating: "an
issuer or other party that structures its delivery in accordance with the principles and examples
set forth below can be assured that it is satisfying its delivery obligations under the federal
securities laws."<sup></sup><a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>
<p> There are three areas of concern for electronic delivery of information: notice,
access and precautions to safeguard against mechanical failure. 

<p>The receipt of mail serves as notice that new information is available.<sup></sup><a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>
<p> With this in mind,
issuers should consider the degree of notice supplied by the selected medium.<sup></sup><a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>
<p> Certain types of
electronic documents, such as CD-Rom or floppy disk, would provide sufficient notice upon
receipt.<sup></sup><a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>
<p> However, electronic documents posted on a Web site would require a separate notice,
unless the issuer can show that delivery has actually been satisfied, or if the document is not
required to be delivered under the federal securities laws.<sup></sup><a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>In addition to notice, electronic delivery should provide access to the information similar to paper
delivery.<sup></sup><a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>
<p> Thus, the electronic medium selected should allow the recipient to effectively access
the information, and should also allow the recipient to either retain the information or have
ongoing access to it.<sup></sup><a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>
<p> Further, an issuer should prepare paper versions of all electronic
documents as a precautionary measure.<sup></sup><a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>
<p> System failure, computer incompatibilities, and
revocation of consent to electronic delivery are examples of situations in which a backup copy of
electronic documents would be required.<sup></sup><a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>An issuer using electronic media to deliver information should have assurances that the delivery
requirements are satisfied.<sup></sup><a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>
<p> There are several procedures that will give evidence that these
requirements have been satisfied. An issuer can obtain the informed consent of the recipient to
receive information via a particular medium.<sup></sup><a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>
<p> Also, an electronic return receipt or confirmation
of accessing, downloading or printing would provide evidence of actual delivery.<sup></sup><a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>
<p> Facsimile
methods also provide evidence of actual delivery.<sup></sup><a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>
<p> If an investor accesses a document with a
hyperlink to a required document or uses forms or other material only available by accessing the
information, delivery can likewise be considered complete.<sup></sup><a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>
<p> "Basically, electronically delivered
documents must be prepared, updated and delivered consistent with the provisions of the federal
securities laws in the same manner as paper documents."<sup></sup><a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=SECURITIES>IV. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE</A>

<p>The delivery of documents electronically is not the only area where cyberspace technology is
changing securities transactions. Issuers are now using cyberspace to facilitate the trading of their
stocks, using, for example, bulletin board stock trading systems or initial public offerings
conducted  over the Internet. Issuer created bulletin board stock trading systems have been
developed primarily to allow companies with illiquid stocks to provide a forum for stock holders
to buy and sell the securities of the host company. Currently, the SEC has approved  passive
bulletin boards maintained by corporations such as Real Goods Trading Corporation and Spring
Street Brewing Company. 

<p align="center"><A NAME=BULLETIN BOARD>V. BULLETIN BOARD PASSIVE STOCK TRADING SYSTEMS</A>

<p align="center"><A NAME=TRADING>VI. REAL GOODS TRADING CORPORATION</A><sup></sup><a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Real Goods Trading Corporation (RGTC) sells alternative energy and conservation products
through mail order.<sup></sup><a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>
<p> It is registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933,
and is traded on the Pacific Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, although trading in RGTC stock is
very light.<sup></sup><a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>
<p> Considering this, RGTC proposed in a letter to the SEC to establish a passive
bulletin board trading system to sell common stock of RGTC.<sup></sup><a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>
<p> This system will provide certain
information to interested buyers and sellers, such as: the name, address and phone number (or
other means of contact) of interested parties, the number of shares of common stock the party
wishes to sell or purchase, the desired price, and the date the information was entered.<sup></sup><a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>
<p> Parties
may transmit this information either through RGTC's Web site or by using telephone, fax, mail or
e-mail communication with RGTC, which will then be entered into the system.<sup></sup><a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>
<p> RGTC will not
carry out any transaction, instead, all transactions will be accomplished by direct contact between
the buyer and the seller.<sup></sup><a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>RGTC will simply provide certain data to all buyers and sellers. The bulletin board contains
information identifying the national securities exchanges which list RGTC stock.<sup></sup><a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>
<p> Also, the
bulletin board indicates that RGTC is neither a registered securities exchange, securities
information processor, broker, dealer or investment advisor.<sup></sup><a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>
<p> The information contained in the
system is not a list of firm quotes, but merely offers from buyers and sellers, and all transactions
are made independent of RGTC.<sup></sup><a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>
<p> This gives the shareholders of RGTC more control over the
price of their stocks while at the same time saving them money by eliminating broker's fees.<sup></sup><a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>

<p>Further, potential participants are informed that all applicable state and federal securities laws,
such as anti fraud and anti manipulation provisions, will apply to any offer made or transaction
effectuated through the system.<sup></sup><a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>
<p> RGTC provides the name, address and phone number of the
transfer agent, and state that all brokers, dealers, associates of brokers or dealers, and people with
state securities licenses must identify themselves as such.<sup></sup><a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>
<p> The system prohibits two-sided
quotes, in which one offers to buy at one price and sell at a higher price.<sup></sup><a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>
<p> Finally, prospective
traders are informed that the registration requirements of the federal securities laws are
applicable to all offers and sales through the system.<sup></sup><a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The SEC responded to RGTC's proposal on June 24, 1996 with a no-action letter, allowing them
to set up a passive bulletin board trading system.<sup></sup><a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>
<p> Offers and sales through the system will not
be required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and RGTC will not be required to
register under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 to operate the system.<sup></sup><a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>
<p> The SEC will not
recommend any enforcement be taken against RGTC under Sections 5, 6 or 15 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as long as RGTC operates the system without registering as a national
securities exchange under Section 6 and without registering as a broker-dealer under Section 15
of the Exchange Act.<sup></sup><a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>
<p> The basis of this decision rests on certain elements noted by the SEC.
First, that RGTC will provide the notices regarding operation of and participation in the
system.<sup></sup><a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>
<p> Also, RGTC is already a Section 12 registrant, and must maintain either that status or
otherwise provide the information required by Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.<sup></sup><a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a>
<p> The SEC further asks that RGTC keep records detailing all quotes listed in the system
and will make them available to the SEC or any regulated market which lists RGTC stock upon
their reasonable request.<sup></sup><a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>
<p> Furthermore, in advertising the existence of the system, RGTC shall
not characterize itself as a broker, dealer, or exchange, and will comply with the limitations on
soliciting offers to buy.<sup></sup><a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>
<p> Finally, the SEC noted its approval that neither RGTC nor its affiliates
will receive any compensation for the creation, maintenance or use of the system, be involved in
any purchase or sale negotiations occurring in the system, provide information on the advisability
of any proposed transaction, or receive, hold or transfer any funds or securities as part of
operating the system.<sup></sup><a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p align="center"><A NAME=WIT-TRADE>VII. WIT-TRADE</A>

<p>Another company which has established a passive bulletin board stock trading system is Spring
Street Brewing Company with Wit-Trade.<sup></sup><a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>
<p> Like RGTC, Spring Street neither negotiates nor
otherwise facilitates the offers and bids posted.<sup></sup><a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>
<p> Wit-Trade suspended activity on the system
pending a review by the SEC.<sup></sup><a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a>
<p> On March 22, 1996, the SEC issued a no action letter
concerning Wit-Trade, provided certain concerns were met. First, investor's funds must be
handled properly.<sup></sup><a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a>
<p> An escrow agent or bank independent of Spring Street should be used to
receive checks from buyers, payable directly to the seller or the agent.<sup></sup><a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>
<p> Also, since systems
such as Wit-Trade may attract unsophisticated traders, investors need to be made aware of the
risks involved in the purchase of illiquid securities.<sup></sup><a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a>
<p> Information aimed at first time investors
should be added to the bulletin board, informing prospective participants that the company's
stocks are not traded on any registered securities market or NASDAQ, the market for the shares
may not be very liquid, and that there is no guarantee that they will be able to sell their shares at
their desired price.<sup></sup><a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>
<p> Also, participants should be informed that if they post on both the buyer
and seller boards at the same time, they may be considered a dealer<sup></sup><a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>
<p> and be required to register
as such and comply with broker-dealer requirements.<sup></sup><a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>
<p> Another concern is that participants be
provided with recent sale prices. Wit-Trade should track all transactions listing the price and
number of shares bought and sold, making this information available upon a reasonable request
to help potential investors in making decisions.<sup></sup><a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>
<p> Investors also should be provided with
disclosure concerning the company. As the sale of securities through Wit-Trade involves an offer
or sale by Spring Street for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, registration under the Act is
required, unless an exemption applies.<sup></sup><a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a>
<p> The Regulation A conditional small issues exemption
appears to apply to Wit-Trade, leaving it exempt under section 3(b) of the Securities Act of
1933.<sup></sup><a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>
<p> Once Spring Street Brewing Company implements the required modifications, Wit-Trade may go online with its passive bulletin board system.

<p align="center"><A NAME=OFFERINGS>VIII. INTERNET OFFERINGS</A>

<p align="center"><A NAME=IPOnet>IX. IPOnet</A>

<p>Another area in which cyberspace technology is changing the way securities transactions are
conducted is in initial public offerings. IPOnet is a service established by Leo Feldman, a
registered principal of W.J. Gallagher, Inc., which is a general securities business which includes
participation as a selected dealer in public offerings.<sup></sup><a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>
<p> Gallagher established and maintains a
system to supervise the activities of IPOnet in order to reach compliance with all applicable
securities laws.<sup></sup><a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>
<p> IPOnet has set up a Web site which allows investors to receive information
concerning  initial public offerings.<sup></sup><a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a>
<p> The Web site contains both tombstone advertisements
meeting the requirements of Rule 134 and red herring prospectuses meeting the requirements of
Rule 430.<sup></sup><a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a>
<p> The Web site also states: "the securities offered by [Name of Issuer] pursuant to the
Preliminary Prospectus dated [insert date] are available through W.J. Gallagher &amp; Company,
Inc."<sup></sup><a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>
<p> In the event that Gallagher is not the underwriter of the offering, the statement will state
that Gallagher is nonetheless authorized to accept customer orders for the purchase of
securities.<sup></sup><a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>
<p> All tombstone advertisements and red herring prospectuses on IPOnet will have
portions of Rule 134(b)(1) and (d) linked to them, stating: 

<p>"A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor
may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This
(communication) shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall
there be any sale of these securities in any State in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be
unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.

<p>No offer to buy the securities can be accepted and no part of the purchase price can be received
until the registration statement has become effective and any such offer may be withdrawn or
revoked, without obligation or commitment of any kind, at any time prior to notice of its
acceptance given after the effective date. An indication of interest in response to the
advertisement will involve no obligation or commitment of any kind."<sup></sup><a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Each red herring prospectus will contain a link to an electronic coupon or card which enables
investors to indicate interest in purchasing the security by sending the card via e-mail,
communications link, or regular mail.<sup></sup><a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a>
<p> Certain members of IPOnet may receive information
concerning private offerings, but only after being qualified as either accredited or sophisticated
investors.<sup></sup><a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a>
<p> An online questionnaire allows Gallagher to determine if a potential investor meets
the requirements of either Regulation D, Rule 501(a) or Rule 506.<sup></sup><a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a>
<p> Once an investor is
qualified as accredited or sophisticated, a password will be issued enabling the investor to access
a private, password protected page where private offerings are posted.<sup></sup><a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a>
<p> An
accredited/sophisticated investor may only access the private offerings which are posted after the
qualification.<sup></sup><a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a>
<p> With the consent of the investor, IPOnet may contact accredited investors
concerning private offerings in the future.<sup></sup><a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a>
<p> No mention or description of a private issuer may be
made in any other area of IPOnet, except for in the password protected area of the site.<sup></sup><a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a>
<p> The
SEC issued a no action letter concerning IPOnet, stating simply that the acceptance of a coupon
or card via electronic communications would satisfy the requirements of Rule 134(d) and that
pursuant to Securities Act Regulation D, Rule 502(c), qualifying an investor as accredited, with
private offerings posted in a password protected page, would not constitute a general solicitation
or general advertising.<sup></sup><a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are other areas of securities law as well where cyberspace technology is raising questions,
ranging from registration issues to what kind of information may be displayed on a Web page. In
many cases these questions can be answered by simply applying the current securities laws,
although some guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission may be necessary. 

<p align="center"><A NAME=REGULATION A>X. REGULATION A OFFERINGS</A>

<p>All offerings of securities are must be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, although some
exemptions are available.<sup></sup><a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>
<p> This includes offerings conducted over the Internet, which must
comply with all federal securities laws as well as all applicable state Blue Sky Laws.<sup></sup><a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a>
<p> Certain
specific exemptions are especially applicable to Internet initial public offerings.<sup></sup><a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a>
<p> The most
common method of conducting an Internet IPO is under Regulation A of the Securities Act,
which provides an exemption for offerings less than $5 million under Securities Act Section
3(b).<sup></sup><a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a>
<p> A Regulation A offering provides several benefits to an issuer. Stockholders can resell
their securities without restriction, subject only to certain limitations.<sup></sup><a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a>
<p> The offering need not be
limited to accredited investors, but may be made to an unlimited number of investors, and an
underwriter may be used.<sup></sup><a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a>
<p> Also, an issuer is not necessarily required to make periodic filings
with the SEC, unless required to do so already by Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.<sup></sup><a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a>
<p> Further, any financial statements which are contained in the offering document but are
not required by the Exchange Act are not required to be audited.<sup></sup><a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a>
<p> A Regulation A offering may
be filed with a regional office of the SEC, which allows for faster review.<sup></sup><a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>
<p> Additionally, a
Regulation A offering does not subject an issuer to strict liability under Section 11 of the
Securities Act, is less expensive than a registered offering, and allows an issuer to "test the
waters" for interest.<sup></sup><a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>To determine if an issuer is eligible to use Regulation A, one must look to the issuer itself, the
size of the offering, and to any other placement of securities which may be integrated with the
Regulation A offering. The issuer must be an American or Canadian company with its principal
place of business in one of the two countries.<sup></sup><a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a>
<p> An issuer will not be able to use a Regulation A
exemption  if it is already a reporting company, is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, is a development stage company without a specific business plan, or one whose business
plan is to merge with an unidentified company.<sup></sup><a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>
<p> Also, issuers of fractional undivided interests
in oil, gas or mineral rights and issuers subject to the "bad boy" provisions of Rule 258 or 262 of
Regulation A are precluded from a Regulation A offering.<sup></sup><a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a>
<p> Issuers may only sell up to $5
million of securities during a one year period, and parties other than the issuer may sell up to $1.5
million during a one year period.<sup></sup><a href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a>
<p> If an issuer has conducted a registered offering  in close
proximity to an unregistered Regulation A offering, the two may be integrated together, meaning
the Regulation A offering could then be considered in violation of registration laws.<sup></sup><a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a>
<p> However,
Rule 251(c) of Regulation A holds a safe harbor provision to protect issuers from integration
with prior offers of securities and subsequent offers which meet certain requirements.<sup></sup><a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a>
<p> To
avoid integration with a subsequent offer, the offer must be registered under the Securities Act,
although an issuer may "test the waters" according to Rule 254(d) of Regulation D.<sup></sup><a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>
<p> Also,
subsequent unregistered offerings under employee benefit plans which rely on Rule 701 of the
Securities Act will not be integrated with a Regulation A offering.<sup></sup><a href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a>
<p> Similarly, unregistered
offerings of offshore sales of securities under Regulation S are not integrated.<sup></sup><a href="#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a>
<p> Finally, any
offering made more than six months after a Regulation A offering has been completed will not be
integrated.<sup></sup><a href="#N_107_"><sup>(107)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME= D REGULATION>XI. REGULATION D OFFERINGS</A>

<p>Another means of conducting an initial public offering over the Internet, although not as popular
as Regulation A, is to use Rule 504 of Regulation D.<sup></sup><a href="#N_108_"><sup>(108)</sup></a>
<p> Rule 504 offers some exemptions from
registration for smaller offerings under $1 million, although the general provisions of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act concerning fraud are still applicable.<sup></sup><a href="#N_109_"><sup>(109)</sup></a>
<p> Under Rule 504,
registration with the SEC is not necessary, and there are no limitations on the method of
soliciting investors, the issuer's disclosure of information, nor on the number of potential
investors, their sophistication, ability to handle the risk, or their intent with regards to holding the
securities for investment.<sup></sup><a href="#N_110_"><sup>(110)</sup></a>
<p> Rule 504 simply requires that an issuer only offer and sell $1
million in a given twelve month period. <sup></sup><a href="#N_111_"><sup>(111)</sup></a>
<p> There are also more lenient issuer requirements than
for a Regulation A offering, since Rule 504 only precludes Exchange Act reporting companies,
investment companies, and development stage companies with no specific business plan or 
whose business plan is to merge with an unidentified company.<sup></sup><a href="#N_112_"><sup>(112)</sup></a>
<p> However, integration, as
discussed earlier, may also apply in Rule 504 of Regulation D offerings.<sup></sup><a href="#N_113_"><sup>(113)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Another option for conducting an initial public offering over the Internet is under Rules 505 and
506 of Regulation D. These rules also offer exemptions from Securities Act registration
requirements,  provided certain requirements are met. Only up to thirty-five non-accredited
investors may be involved,<sup></sup><a href="#N_114_"><sup>(114)</sup></a>
<p> and all non-accredited investors must receive certain disclosures
about both the issuer and the offering.<sup></sup><a href="#N_115_"><sup>(115)</sup></a>
<p>  No general solicitation or other type of advertisement
may be used in conjunction with the offering.<sup></sup><a href="#N_116_"><sup>(116)</sup></a>
<p> Only $5 million in securities may be sold under
Rules 505 and 506 in any one year period.<sup></sup><a href="#N_117_"><sup>(117)</sup></a>
<p> In addition to the limitation on general solicitation
and sales to non-accredited investors, another disadvantage of a Regulation D private placement
is that the securities are not freely tradeable by the purchasers.<sup></sup><a href="#N_118_"><sup>(118)</sup></a>
<p>. This is the type of offering
conducted by IPONET, as described earlier.

<p align="center"><A NAME=STATE>XII. STATE REGISTRATION</A>

<p>Up to this point, only federal securities laws have been discussed. However, each state also has
its own securities laws and guidelines, commonly called "blue sky laws".<sup></sup><a href="#N_119_"><sup>(119)</sup></a>
<p> To help with the
coordination of complying with each state's varying requirements, the Small Corporate Offering
Registration Form (SCOR), or Form U-7, was developed.<sup></sup><a href="#N_120_"><sup>(120)</sup></a>
<p> This form may be used in most
states for small offerings that are exempt under Rule 504.<sup></sup><a href="#N_121_"><sup>(121)</sup></a>
<p> The offering price of the prospectus
must be less than $1 million.<sup></sup><a href="#N_122_"><sup>(122)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Each state has its own rules for a SCOR U-7 Form offering.<sup></sup><a href="#N_123_"><sup>(123)</sup></a>
<p> In Texas, the general solicitation
of potential investors through newspaper advertisements and direct mailings is allowed, provided
the following requirements are met.<sup></sup><a href="#N_124_"><sup>(124)</sup></a>
<p> Certain types of entities are precluded from using the
SCOR U-7 Form, such as those engaged in extractive industries such as petroleum exploration
and production or mining, those without a specific business plan ("blind pool" entities),
investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Exchange Act reporting
companies, selling security holders, and entities subject to any "bad boy" provisions.<sup></sup><a href="#N_125_"><sup>(125)</sup></a>

<p>Additionally, the offering price for common stock must be at least $5.00 per share, although it
may be higher, and the common stock may not be split or have dividends declared for two years
after the registration has become effective.<sup></sup><a href="#N_126_"><sup>(126)</sup></a>
<p> The issuer must include a Uniform Application to
Register Securities, a Uniform Consent to Service of Process, and a Uniform Corporate
Resolution  along with other specified exhibits with the SCOR U-7 Form, as well as a legal
opinion concerning the authorization and issuance of the securities.<sup></sup><a href="#N_127_"><sup>(127)</sup></a>
<p> There are also certain
requirements concerning financial statements. Issuers must provide an audited balance sheet for
the most recent fiscal year along with an income statement, a cash flow statement, and a
statement of change in stockholder equity for the year prior to the balance sheet, in addition to
providing investors with financial statements for the five years following the offering.<sup></sup><a href="#N_128_"><sup>(128)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>Since information and solicitations delivered over the Internet can not be directed to a specific
group, but are generally posted for the public at large, any Internet posting of a prospectus could
require registration with every single state in addition to foreign jurisdictions in which it is
accessible.<sup></sup><a href="#N_129_"><sup>(129)</sup></a>
<p> To address this issue, the North American Securities Administrators Association
proposed an Internet exemption to state registration in cases where the offer states that it is not
being made to residents of the state in question, an offer is not being made by other means to
residents of the state, and that sales of the issuer's securities are not being made in the state from
the Internet offer.<sup></sup><a href="#N_130_"><sup>(130)</sup></a>
<p> To date, Pennsylvania, Alaska, Connecticut, Indiana, New Jersey, Vermont
and Texas have Internet exemptions such as this in place.<sup></sup><a href="#N_131_"><sup>(131)</sup></a>
<p> For example, the Texas State
Securities Board enacted on February 27, 1996, its rule entitled <u>Offers Disseminated Through the
Internet</u>.<sup></sup><a href="#N_132_"><sup>(132)</sup></a>
<p> This provision exempts offers of securities from the securities and dealer registration
requirements of the State of Texas when the offer is made from outside of Texas, and the offer
exhibits the following three conditions: (1) the securities are not being offered for sale to any
person in Texas, (2) an offer is not otherwise directed to any person in Texas by the issuer, and
(3) no sales of the issuer's securities are being made in Texas as a result of the offer.<sup></sup><a href="#N_133_"><sup>(133)</sup></a>
<p> The same
conditions will relieve an issuer offering securities from inside Texas from the securities
registration requirements, but not from the dealer registration requirements.<sup></sup><a href="#N_134_"><sup>(134)</sup></a>
<p> A notice such as
"These securities are not being offered or sold in Texas."<sup></sup><a href="#N_135_"><sup>(135)</sup></a>
<p>, "These securities are being offered
and sold in (<u>fill in the name of states other than Texas)</u>."<sup></sup><a href="#N_136_"><sup>(136)</sup></a>
<p>, or "This is neither a solicitation to
buy nor an offer to sell to persons in Texas."<sup></sup><a href="#N_137_"><sup>(137)</sup></a>
<p> will be sufficient to satisfy the rule.<sup></sup><a href="#N_138_"><sup>(138)</sup></a>
<p> However,
no such effort has been made with regards to the international aspects of registering an Internet
offer.

<p align="center"><A NAME=TESTING>XIII. TESTING THE WATERS</A>

<p>An Internet posting may also be used to "test the waters" for potential interest, however, an 
issuer must be careful to follow both federal and state laws. Under federal  law, Regulation A,
discussed earlier, allows "testing the waters" under Rule 254, subject to certain requirements.<sup></sup><a href="#N_139_"><sup>(139)</sup></a>

<p>An issuer must publish information about itself and its business and solicit indications of interest
before it files a Regulation A offering statement.<sup></sup><a href="#N_140_"><sup>(140)</sup></a>
<p> The materials must also state that money is
neither being solicited nor accepted, no sales or commitments to purchase will be made until the
offering circular is delivered, no obligation is created by an indication of interest, and the
material must reveal the identity of the chief executive officer and the type of business and
products in which the company is involved.<sup></sup><a href="#N_141_"><sup>(141)</sup></a>
<p> However, most states, under  their Blue Sky
Laws, do not allow "testing the waters".<sup></sup><a href="#N_142_"><sup>(142)</sup></a>
<p> For this reason, it has been suggested that issuers
state in any "testing the waters" solicitation that the offering is only directed to residents of states
where an exemption has been granted.<sup></sup><a href="#N_143_"><sup>(143)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p align="center"><A NAME=HOME PAGE>XIV. OFFERING INFORMATION ON A HOME PAGE</A>

<p>When an offering is being made, between the time of the filing of the registration or offering
statement and the time the registration statement becomes effective or the offering statement is
qualified, only a prospectus or offering circular filed with the SEC may be used to make an
offer.<sup></sup><a href="#N_144_"><sup>(144)</sup></a>
<p> Once this time period is over, however, other sales materials may be used, as long as
they are filed with the SEC.<sup></sup><a href="#N_145_"><sup>(145)</sup></a>
<p> To satisfy SEC requirements regarding supplemental sales
material, a prospectus should either be near the material in the menu or appear as a hyperlink
within the supplemental material.<sup></sup><a href="#N_146_"><sup>(146)</sup></a>
<p> Such supplemental material on the Internet could include
graphic, video and audio presentations.<sup></sup><a href="#N_147_"><sup>(147)</sup></a>
<p> Scripts and descriptions of the material are required to
be filed with the SEC.<sup></sup><a href="#N_148_"><sup>(148)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>These topics are only the tip of the iceberg. As long as pre-cyberspace securities laws are applied
to a technology which has demonstrated its ability to outpace such attempts to regulate it, there
will be new ways for creative businessmen and attorneys to reach out to potential investors in
ever increasing numbers. The Securities and Exchange Commission and several of the states,
such as Texas, have moved in the right direction, by either promulgating new laws designed to
deal specifically with the unique possibilities opened up by cyberspace, or by providing guidance
as to how past laws will be construed with regards to the new medium. The Internet may quite
possibly become a global stock market of the future, holding great risks and the possibility of
great rewards.

<p align="center"><A NAME=INTRODUCTION>I. Introduction</A>

<p>This article examines first, the concept of cyberbanking, and then the legal implications of this
new age of  banking transactions.  Over the past few years, the banking industry has dramatically
changed; in addition to banks merging into fewer, bigger banking institutions, there has also been
a multitude of  nontraditional entrants into the banking field.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>   These factors, as well as
progressive changes in the computer and telecommunications technologies that can be used in
banking transactions, contributed to the current expansion of electronic banking services, or
"cyberbanking."<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>

<p align="center"><A NAME=WHAT>II.  What is Cyberbanking?</A>

<p>The term "cyberbanking" is used to refer to any form of electronic banking; thus, using a debit
card, checking the balance of an account and transferring money by telephone were essentially
the first methods of cyberbanking developed.  Further, new methods of electronic banking are
becoming more and more prevalent as the Internet is becoming more popular; smart-cards,  home
banking using a personal computer, e-cash, and e-checks are several banking areas under
development to meet customer convenience needs.

<p>Currently, smart-cards and stored value cards are the most commonly used mode of
cyberbanking.  Most of this use is taking place in Europe where the "smart-card" has been
utilized for more than ten years<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>; however, the U.S. is presently conducting a series of pilot
programs to introduce the smart-card into mainstream use.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  Smart-cards resemble credit cards
in appearance, but they are more sophisticated in that they contain an internal microchip that can
be programmed and reprogrammed with different information; this microchip is also capable of
various kinds of short and long term memory.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  Thus, it can store and manipulate payment data
as needed.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  In order to work, the smart-card needs the outside power source of a reader
interface; the interface accesses the random access memory of the card while the transaction is
taking place, and then the software in the read-only memory on the microchip stores relevant
information from that transaction in the random access memory, for example, how much value is
left on the card.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  Usually, the card requires the physical contact with the reader, but contactless
cards that use electricity or radio signals are being developed.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>  

<p>Stored value cards work in much the same way as smart cards; in fact, the two terms are
frequently used interchangeably because a smart card does store value.  A stored value card has a
payment capacity that exists on the card through information that is then accessed through a
potential payee's terminal; this information informs the payee of the card holder's right to certain
amounts of money, and then the terminal can transfer that right to the payee.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>  More clearly, the
stored value card, working with the payee's terminal, transfers the "digital equivalent of bills or
coins to a payee's digital 'cash register.'"<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>  In this way, the stored value card decreases
transaction costs because the card carries the value directly, instead of indirectly pointing to
another account that carries the value.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  

<p>As previously mentioned, this new development in computer technology is already being piloted
in New York and was used at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.  The pending widespread use
and popularity of this new payment system brings with it certain legal issues.  The legal issues
involving smart-cards and stored value cards will be discussed in-depth below.

<p>In addition to smart-cards, home banking through the Internet and through private online services
also provides the consumer with innovative ways to access their money.  First, the Internet
already has a surprising number of banks and services to offer.  Banks are creating home pages
on the World Wide Web ("WWW") that customers can directly access; this party to party
interaction is beneficial because it  keeps the same type of customer relationship, and the same
control over that relationship which banks have with current "face to face" transactions.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>   For
example, Wells Fargo &amp; Co.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> offers a broad range of transactional services to its online
customers including the ability to check account balances, transfer funds, pay bills electronically,
and apply for loans.  Other large banks, like Nationsbank and BankAmerica,<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> also offer their
services online. 

<p>Furthermore, the Internet is presently accessed through relatively slow telephone modem lines,
but the current development of high speed, broadband access will transfer information over 1,000
times faster making full multimedia applications available on a bank's web site.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  In addition,
this technology will enable the convergence of the personal computer and the television set. That
is, a customer will be able to conduct online banking and at the same time watch a television
program.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>  For instance, Barnett Bank is about to offer a television banking service, as a
research and development experiment, called the "BarnettTown virtual community" that is like a
"financial services video-game."<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>

<p>Secondly, several private online services have contracts with banks to provide electronic banking
needs.  Late last year, for example, Intuit and America Online ("AOL") created a partnership
where AOL's four million subscribers would get the benefit of online banking services provided
by Intuit's allied financial institutions.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>  "Intuit will develop extensions to America Online's
basic software that will give America Online users point-and-click access to their checking and
savings account, credit card, money market fund, and brokerage records."<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>  This middleman
added to the bank dealings with the customer could be perceived as threatening to the bank's
financial stability, but the consumer may prefer online networks like AOL because of perceived
added security and convenience over banking directly on the Internet.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a> 

<p>Still another method of banking online is through the use of personal finance software. Intuit and
Microsoft, the makers of Quicken and Money respectively, have entered agreements with over
two dozen banks to offer customers electronic banking services using their software.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>  To
illustrate, "to pay a bill, a customer enters the name and address of the payee, the payment
amount and the payment due date.  Intuit Services Corp., payment processor for both Quicken
and Money, deducts the proper amount from the payor's account and electronically credits the
payee."<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>   This venture could prove to be a two-sided coin: on one side, the software provider
drives a wedge between the customer and the bank, possibly threatening the bank's financial
success like the online private networks; on the other side, because the software vendor enters 
agreements with many banks, they can offer the customer a choice of the lowest rates available
on mortgages, auto loans, and other banking services.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>  In addition, BankAmerica and
NationsBank have joined together to purchase Meca Software, the company which created
Managing Your Money, a personal finance software package similar to Quicken and Money;
subsequently, three other bank-investors pledged money to the new Meca software, creating a
20% share in each bank.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>  "Unlike banks that partnered with Intuit or Microsoft, Meca owners
claim their deal gives them the advantage of maintaining control over the customer."<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>  

<p>There are also Internet payment systems such as e-cash, credit cards, and electronic checks that
are now under experimentation before being offered universally to consumers.  E-cash is a
concept promoted specifically by two companies: CyberCash's CyberCoin, and DigiCash.  To
use e-cash on the Internet, potential purchasers buy the e-coins from either DigiCash or
CyberCoin,<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> and pay for them by downloading value from their bank account with number and
password to "electronic wallets" provided by the appropriate company's software package in the
purchaser's computer.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>  Then the purchaser can spend the e-cash at Internet merchants offering
the service.  Both companies' products offer protection of the purchaser's privacy; the "software
hides the information on the payee . . . [Thus,] no one can determine how a user spends their [sic]
money."<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>  Through the use of a serial number on each e-coin, a bank can prevent taking the
same coin for payment twice, and a payor can authenticate payment to a payee.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>  Currently,
Netscape and CyberCoin have agreed to make e-cash a part of the Netscape LivePayment
program soon to be offered by Netscape.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>  This new product will be discussed more fully
below.

<p>By far, the most popular Internet payment system today is the common credit card.  One can shop
on the Internet, quickly type in a credit card number, and the transaction is done.  However, "by
entering account numbers on the open Internet, customers run the risk of someone else on the
Internet viewing the card number and using it."<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>  Users who do not want to put themselves at
risk may register with one of several companies that offer services which protect  credit card
numbers.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>  For example, with a concept created by First Virtual Holdings, Inc., the customer
establishes an account by phone where by he gives his credit card number and receives a First
Virtual number in return.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>  Then the customer can make purchases at participating online
merchants giving the First Virtual account number instead of the credit card number.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>  

<p>CyberCash has also developed a similar concept for protecting  credit card numbers;  the
customer obtains CyberCash software and loads it on his computer; then, when a WWW browser
wants a credit card number, the customer invokes the software which then encrypts the credit
card number and transmits it to the corresponding software on the merchant's machine.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>  A
third venture to protect consumer credit card numbers has been launched by Netscape.   Netscape
LivePayment, introduced in early October 1996, is "easy-to-use software that enables Web site
developers to collect payments from consumers over the Internet."<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>  This new software
"provides an open and complete financial payment solution supporting real-time credit card
processing to banks over the Internet" using the Secure Sockets Layer public/private key
encryption device; the encryption technology is used to establish "an encrypted channel of
communication between the consumer, a Web site, and a bank card gateway."<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>

<p>A third Internet payment system is the electronic check. The Financial Services Technology
Consortium, which is an open consortium made up of over 90 members from various banking
and technological backgrounds, is currently experimenting with electronic checking via its
Electronic Check Project.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>  "To use the electronic check system, a consumer needs an
electronic checkbook, currently a PC-card, which holds financial data and is small enough to fit
in a slot in the back of a laptop computer."<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>  The electronic check appears as a picture of a
check on the drawer's computer screen.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>  When invoked, the program uses the public key
encryption system to allow the drawer to electronically issue and digitally sign a payment
instruction; thereafter, the drawer sends the e-check over the Internet to a payee with a special
processor where the e-check can be verified as an authentic transaction.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>  

<p>In sum, all of these advances in banking technology, whether using a smart-card or banking on
the Internet, raise legal questions regarding regulation of transactions, possible governmental
involvement, and current applicable law.  These issues will be discussed below.

<p align="center"><A NAME=CURRENT>III.  Current Legal Issues In CyberBanking</A>

<p>The onset of cyberbanking has created many electronic alternatives to conventional forms of
money and banking.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>  One important basic legal issue in the realm of the rapidly developing
area of cyberbanking is the question of what constitutes a "bank."<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>  There are several
definitions of a "bank." The Bank Holding Company Act states that a "bank" generally includes
any FDIC-insured bank or any institution that accepts both demand deposits and engages in the
business of making commercial loans.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>  The Federal Deposit Insurance Act states that a "bank"
includes institutions chartered as banks, and any other "banking" institution that is engaged in the
business of receiving deposits.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>  "Bank" defined by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of
1987 is similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>  Finally, under the National Bank Act,
core "banking" functions generally include the receiving of deposits, paying of checks, or making
of loans.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>  In addition to these four interpretations, the 50 state laws are also used in
determining "bank" status.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>  This conglomerate of definitions does not make it easy to decide if
current electronic providers of bank-like services are indeed banks.  "In the past, many
instruments have existed outside the banking system without having been found to run afoul of . .
. any banking regulations.  Examples include travelers checks, money orders, payment orders,
thrift notes, and brokerage accounts."<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>  With this in mind, as well as other prior applications of
the law, federal banking regulators do not seem ready to declare that non-bank providers of
electronic money alternatives are "engaged in the business of issuing or receiving 'deposits' and
thus should be treated as 'banks.'"<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>

<p>Furthermore, there are also an abundance of smart-card and e-cash related legal issues. Smart
cards in the form of stored value cards illustrate the challenges confronting regulators.<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a> Among
the concerns held by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency is whether these cards can be
issued by non-banks, and the problems resulting if the issuer defaults.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>   After all, stored value
cards will not be the exclusive domain of depository institutions; moreover, the non-bank issuer
could be a private governmental entity.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>  Many lawyers also are concerned as to whether the
Federal Reserve Systems' Reg E promulgated as the Electronic Fund Transfer Act is applicable
to smart cards, and whether stored value should be treated as an "account" subject to Reg E.<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a> 
The Federal Reserve is yet to present the final version of the amended Reg E, but the most recent
congressional testimony<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a> indicates that the Federal Reserve would postpone making a decision
on the applicability of Reg E so as not to stifle the development of this new technology.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>  In
addition, whether the "funds" on the card constitute a deposit for which reserves are required
under the Federal Reserve Act is also an issue<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a>; however, the Federal Reserve Board asserted
that stored value cards are subject to reserve requirements because they are transaction
accounts.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>  Nevertheless, the Fed will have to rethink its position according to  how the stored
value cards are structured.<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a> 

<p>The agency most affected by the introduction of stored value cards is the FDIC; it must ask "Do
stored value cards represent insured deposits, and if so, how do they affect an institution's
deposit assessment base?"<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>  While the FDIC has great discretion in determining what is a
deposit, it is questionable whether numerous existing laws and regulations can be applied easily
to stored value cards and other new forms of currency.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>  Presumably, stored value cards will
have the versatility and universality of current ATM cards, but the complexity of future
transactions leaves the application of FDIC laws and regulations ambiguous.<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>  Unfortunately,
until there is greater uniformity in what constitutes a stored value card, it will be difficult to
ascertain its status as an insured deposit.<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a>  Presently, the FDIC is anticipated to rule  that
balances on stored value cards transferred from a bank account for use in purchasing products
and services generally will not be protected by federal deposit insurance.<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a>

<p>A simple solution would be to treat a stored value card as cash and not as insured deposits since
they are supposed to act as a cash substitute.<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>  Notwithstanding this fact, they do not have the
finality of cash, as they must move through a complex payment system before a transaction can
be completed.<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a>  In conclusion, stored value cards and other similar new products do not fit
easily into the current scheme of laws and regulations relating to depository institutions.<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>

<p>Other e-cash related legal issues include:

<p>1. When is the payee paid?

<p>2. Who may issue 'electronic money'? 

<p>3. Is the issuance of electronic cash limited to banks?

<p>4. Who bears the risk of loss if electronic money is "lost," for example, where a       system
crashes?

<p>5. What laws govern these products?<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>

<p>Privacy is also a major legal issue in the area of cyberbanking.  Electronic communications
conducted through open computer networks such as the Internet raise the likelihood that
confidential consumer account and other information will be obtained, or tampered with, by third
parties.<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>  Because consumers may not be accustomed to these new electronic banking products,
they may not anticipate conceivable disclosure of personal information to third parties in
association with the use of such products.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>  Current privacy law addresses some privacy issues;
for example, the federal Right to Financial Privacy Act forbids the furnishing of information to
the federal government, except to the extent specifically permitted under the Act.<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a>  Also, for
payment products which are subject to the EFTA, the regulation requires a financial institution to
disclose to consumers the conditions under which the financial institution "in ordinary course of
business will disclose information to third parties concerning the consumer's account."<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>  Other
current privacy laws include the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>, the Computer Matching
and Privacy Protection Act of 1988<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>, the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a>, state laws,
state constitutional provisions, privacy statements in some financial institutions marketing
materials, principles of the National Information Infrastructure Task Force, and potential Federal
Reserve Initiative.<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a> 

<p>Perhaps the most important development within the issue of privacy comes from the private
sector: Visa and MasterCard have converged their separate efforts into one new specification
called Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) to develop security standards for electronic banking
and commerce transactions.<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>  "A single standard means that consumers and merchants will be
able to conduct bankcard transactions in cyberspace as securely and easily as they do in retail
stores."<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>  SET relies on key-pair encryption technology where public keys (or sets of very large
prime numbers configured in particular relationships to each other) are dispersed to cardholders,
merchants, and acquiring banks for subsequent algorithmic creation of private keys, which are
available only to particular entities.<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a>  A certification authority controls distribution of the keys
and the information associated with each key holder; the certificate authority for SET is
Verisign.<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a>  Thus, the public-private key pair becomes the means of encrypting and decrypting
financial transaction information between legitimate parties.<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a>  There are many other participants
in this effort including IBM, Microsoft, and Netscape,<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a> making SET a more universally
accessible and acceptable product.  Visa and MasterCard envision that banks will be offering
secure bankcard services via the Internet to their cardholders in the fourth quarter of 1996.<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a>

<p>Certainly there are many more miscellaneous legal issues arising within the cyberbanking
framework.  Consumer protection issues, expedited funds availability, UCC issues, supervisory
issues, payment system risk, monetary policy issues, copyright issues, interstate branching issues,
antitrust issues, and international law issues are just a few of those to be considered in the near
future by banking legislators.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a>

<p align="center"><A NAME=APPLICATION>IV.  Application of Federal Regulation E and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act</A>

<p align="center">To Issues of Cyberbanking

<p>The Fed's Regulation E implements the EFTA to safeguard consumers engaging in electronic
fund transfers.  Currently, this is the only law that is definitely applicable to at least  some aspects
of cyberbanking, especially stored value cards.  To constitute an electronic fund transfer subject
to Reg E, a transaction must have three elements: it must be (1) a transfer of funds (2) that is
initiated by electronic means and (3) debits or credits a consumer account.<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a>   Reg E has six
basic substantive requirements:

<p>1. It restricts the unsolicited issuance of debit cards and other account access devices.

<p>2. It requires certain initial disclosures of the terms and conditions of the electronic funds transfer
service.

<p>3. It requires notice of certain changes in the terms or conditions initially disclosed.

<p>4. It requires transaction receipts and periodic account statements.

<p>5. It limits the consumer's liability for unauthorized transfers.

<p>6. It establishes error resolution procedures.<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a>

<p>In considering electronic banking and the previous explanation of an electronic fund transfer,
there is an evident question: does Reg E apply to transactions using stored value cards?<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a>  Since
such transactions clearly entail a transfer of electronically initiated funds, the legal issue is
whether the stored value card transaction debits or credits an "account."<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>  The Fed has currently
proposed amendments to Reg E that would establish four categories of stored value systems to
help address the legal issues:<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a> 

<p>The first category would be all stored value cards with a value of under $100.    None of the
substantive Reg E requirements would apply to these low-balance cards.  Second, the proposal
defines "off-line" and "on-line" stored value "accounts."  An off-line account is defined as one
where the balance of funds is recorded on the card itself and there is no on-line authorization of
transactions.  An online account is defined as one where the balance is maintained on a separate
database and not recorded on the card itself and transactions are authorized by means of online
communication.  By defining these off-line and on-line cards as "accounts" the proposal would
bring them within the scope of Reg E.  Third, within off-line systems, the proposal would make a
distinction between accountable and unaccountable systems.  An off-line accountable system is
one in which the card balance is maintained on a separate database apart from the card.  An
unaccountable system is one in which the card balance is not maintained on a central database,
but only on the card itself.  The distinction between accountable and unaccountable systems is
not made by defining such terms in the proposed regulation.  Rather, it is made by including in
the definition of  "off-line store value account" a requirement that the balance of funds be
maintained on a separate database as well as the card.  As a result, if the balance is not
maintained on a separate database, the card does not fall within the definition of an off-line
stored value account.  The concept is that it does not access an "account"-that is, it is
"unaccountable".<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a>

<p>The proposal itself does not give illustrations of which currently developing systems fall into
which categories.<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a>

<p>In addition, although patterned after the current check payment system, the e-check likely falls
within the scope of Reg E because it is initiated by the consumer at an electronic terminal and
results in a debit to the drawer's (the consumer's) account at the paying bank.<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a>  Finally, the
effect of the EFTA and Reg E must be considered if deposit account transactions are offered<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a>;
the very use of the Internet in offering deposit account transactions prompts the possible
application of the EFTA.<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a>  One of the principal features of this law involves the disclosures that
must be presented to the customer prior to the issuance of any "access device" for effecting
electronic funds transfers.<a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a>  The question arises as to whether the use of the customer's
computer terminal or the transmission line over which the funds transfer takes place constitutes
an "access device" for purposes of the law.<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>  The Fed is currently contemplating these and other
related issues under this regulation.<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a>

<p align="center"><A NAME=FUTURE>V.  The Future of Cyberbanking</A>

<p>The development of electronic commerce will re-shape banking and financial services more
quickly than many people realize.<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a>  The technological aspects of electronic banking are creating
opportunities for technologically sophisticated banks to offer competitive services; futhermore,
these opportunities extend to a wide range of non-banks, ranging from telephone and cable
companies to software vendors and on-line service providers.<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>  Beyond understanding the
technology itself, it will be important to understand consumer behavior and how it changes.<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a> 
Getting people to embrace new technologies and change habits has always been a challenge, and
will remain so.<a href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a>  A few important questions come to mind:

<p>Will consumers see clear benefits from obtaining products and services on-line?  Will they want
to go to a single source for all of their financial needs, or will they be willing to shop around for
products and services based on price and quality?  If they want to shop around, how will they
gain access to information about prices and quality?  How will attributes such as service quality
and trust be valued.?<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a>

<p>Clearly, privacy is a priority with consumers, and some say that the success of the electronic
transaction system will depend on public confidence.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a>  Future resolution of security and
privacy issues is essential in assuring customers that their electronic transactions will be handled
securely and confidentially.<a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>  Education of the public will be important in resolving these
issues.<a href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a>

<p>Banks, in particular, should think progressively and take a leadership role in the future of
cyberbanking.<a href="#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a>  Some suggestions to banks on how they may take a leadership role include: (1)
be original and first to try something new; (2) initiate industry-driven criterion for conduct--disclosure and security standards, voluntarily established and executed, will be helpful towards
validating the bank as a trustworthy leader; and (3) capitalize on the trust and integrity advantage. 
The public already trusts the banking industry with its money, so banks should use this to their
advantage when promoting electronic banking and strive to be the first in line as this future world
unfolds.<a href="#N_107_"><sup>(107)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As we set out through the information age, much-a-do is made about the Internet. Enthusiasm
over the Internet and its capabilities varies greatly. Some people prefer to ignore the whole
Cyberspace craze and continue living as if no such thing exists. On the other hand, many cyber-enthusiasts spend dozens of hours a week surfing the Net, staying up to date on the all the latest
cyber-trends, and discussing the ways in which our lives will be radically changed by the Net.
Thousands of such Net-junkies across the world see no bounds to the possibilities offered by the
Internet and have found a home riding the information wave in the fast-growing Cyberspace
community. Somewhere between the two extremes lie millions of people who realize that
Cyberspace probably has some potential to alter some things, but as of yet, most of these people
have not seen their lives significantly modified. More and more, however, it is getting hard for
people not to be at least curious about how this web of information and communication might
affect their lives.

<p>Businesses everywhere are setting up web sites to advertise products and services and to conduct
business. Electronic mail is taking a substantial and growing share of the market away from the
post office and telephone companies. Not only are private individuals and businesses
increasingly using Cyberspace, but so are governments.<strong></strong>

<p>Law enforcement is one part of government that is learning to utilize the Internet's capabilities.
This paper examines law enforcement's use of the Internet. More specifically, the paper looks at
(1) how law enforcement is currently using the Internet, (2) how the private sector is using the
Internet to assist law enforcement, (3) what type of controversy surrounds law enforcement's use
of the Internet, and (4) whether law enforcement's use of the Internet is likely to expand.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=CURRENT USES>II. LAW ENFORCEMENT'S CURRENT USES FOR THE INTERNET</strong></A>

<p>From small-town police departments to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and from sheriff's
departments to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internet has become law
enforcement's newest weapon in its ever-expanding arsenal of crime-fighting tools. In some
instances, law enforcement agencies use the Internet in a proactive way--setting up web sights or
building huge on-line databases. In other instances law enforcement agencies are using the
Internet in a more reactive way--trying to control criminals' many uses of the information
superhighway.

<p>Police departments across the nation are finding many advantages to utilizing the Internet. "A
scan of the Internet shows that as many as 500 U.S. police departments are     on-line."<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> How,
exactly, are these police departments using the Internet? Well, their specific uses vary
considerably from one police department to the next. Some merely set up a simple home page as
a public relations tool with perhaps a picture of the police chief along with a brief massage about
the goals of the department or some crime statistics.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Other departments go much farther than
public relations with their home pages.

<p>Take the Tustin Police Department for example. This 10-square-mile municipality at the
southern end of the Los Angeles metropolitan region has a 100-page web site that "offers a
smorgasbord of information ranging from the phone number for a graffiti hotline to warnings
about credit card scams to detailed neighborhood maps displaying locations of armed robberies
and car thefts."<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Officer William Yackle, "webmaster" for Tustin PD's home page, doesn't
expect to frequently catch criminals as a result of information the department receives from the
public on the Internet, rather, he looks at the web sight as a ground breaking and inexpensive
outreach tool that will "provide residents with an alternative source of information about what's
going on in their area."<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 

<p>The Tustin web site costs the department $100 dollars a month to pay an Internet service provider
for hosting the site and then roughly five to 10 hours a week in manpower to keep the site current
and operational.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> And since last December, the site has been logging about 400 "hits" or visits
per day.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> About half of Tustin's net traffic has come from domestic violence victims who are
able to interact with the police department anonymously and get such help as practical advice
about how to file a complaint or seek a temporary restraining order and directions to "a host of
resources and referrals for shelter, legal assistance or medical treatment."<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> The department's
web site may soon also include access to wanted posters for more than 6000 violent Californian
felons,<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> and photographs of missing children.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

<p>In Tennessee, the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department is using its home page to post
information about unsolved crimes in hopes that the public may be able to offer helpful tips.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>
Lt. Ken Pence, designer of the Nashville police's home page says that most organizations seeking
information from the public use the Internet to provide phone numbers for tipsters to call, but he
expects that to change as more organizations allow the public to share information electronically,
via e-mail.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> Pence also says that their department plans to upgrade its home page to provide
concerned citizens with a way to check licence plates of suspicious cars to find out if they have
been stolen.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> '"We realize that citizens are on the team and they need information to better help
us,' Pence said."<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>

<p>While several local police departments have been setting up their own web pages, California law
makers have planned a state-wide Internet site that would provide the public with information
from all of the states's law enforcement agencies.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> At a cost of $145,000 per year the California
Department of Justice would maintain the site, allowing local agencies to forward information on
"missing children, unsolved murders and fugitives wanted for at least 90 days for serious felonies
including homicides, kidnappings, rapes and robberies."<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> "'We are less than four years from the
turn of the century,' Attorney General Dan Lungren said. 'It is about time law enforcement relied
more on the Internet and less on milk cartons to find children, nab fugitives and solve
murders.'"<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

<p>But web sites are not the only way that police are using the Internet. Local police are building
"intranets" to handle department processes and to access internal databases.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> Examples of the
data that will be utilized include "patterns of crime, gang affiliations, and data on previous
suspects and arrests."<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> In Hudson County, New Jersey, a $2 million integrated database system
links the prosecutor with 12 municipal police departments.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> "The database gives police quick
access to digitized records, including CD-ROM photos of every first- and fifth-grade child in the
county, domestic violence orders and child-support non-payment warrants."<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a> In California, the
Highway Patrol plans to spend $62 million outfitting 3,000 squad cars with laptops that will give
officers similar capabilities from the road.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>

<p>Geographical information system technology offers police departments the capability of using
on-line maps and data to track correlations between such information as crimes committed in an
area, locations of crimes, descriptions of offenders, and descriptions of victims.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> In Chicago,
such a system is the linchpin of the city's community policing program according to Barbra B.
McDonald, the police department's director of research and development.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a> Police were able to
grab a knife-wielding purse-snatcher when the Chicago system, dubbed ICAM, for Information
Collecting Automated Mapping, showed a pattern of armed robberies during a three-hour time
period at the same intersection every day.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> ICAM is set up in each of Chicago's 25 districts and
is partially designed internally by police officers so that "all beat cops...can step up to the
controls and in a matter of minutes use selection screens and pick lists to input information or
output detailed maps and reports, revealing patterns police had never noticed."<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>

<p>Law enforcement's use of the Internet only goes back to late 1993 when the FBI set up a web site
seeking information about the unabomber case, making the FBI the first major law enforcement
agency to use the Internet.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> Since then, the FBI has significantly expanded its Internet use.
Some FBI field offices have already gone on-line, and the rest are scheduled to follow by the end
of next year.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> Paul Mark Moskal, an FBI supervisory special agent from the Buffalo office says
that the FBI does get quite a few leads as a result of being on the Internet.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a> 

<p>One such lead that paid large dividends came as a result of the Bureau's home-page display of
their 10 Most Wanted List.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a> Two weeks after John Biskovich had signed up for Internet access
in the small tourist town of Antigua, Guatemala, his 14-year-old son was shocked to discover that
a friendly man he knew as Bill Young was actually a prison escapee who was one of the FBI's 10
most wanted.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a> The sleepy little town soon learned that their neighborly handyman, Bill Young,
was actually Leslie Isben Rogge, "the man who bribed a jail guard and escaped from an Idaho
lockup 11 years ago, who since robbed a string of banks across the United States and who was
considered 'armed and extremely dangerous.'"<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a> A mere four months after Guatemala opened its
phone lines to Internet access, Rogge's surrender to U.S. authorities became the first example of
how law enforcement's new powerful tool can be used to reach out across national boundaries
and track criminals internationally.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>

<p>But while the authorities have this new powerful tool in the Internet, so do a particular breed of
criminals have a new weapon in the Internet. Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney General, Kevin V.
Digregory reported to the Senate Judiciary Committee that after the child pornography trade had
been nearly eradicated in the U.S. by the early 1990s, the proliferation of the Internet has severely
challenged gains made by law enforcement in this area of crime.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a> The FBI has been involved in
two sting operations aimed at Internet distribution of child pornography--the first called
"Operation Long Arm" and the second one called "Innocent Images."<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a> Apparently, the
operations are helping significantly in turning the tide in this battle. Digregory says that "[they]
are taking these despicable predators off the streets--and off their computers--at unprecedented
rates."<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a> As a result of these stings, more than 150 search warrants have been executed
throughout the U.S. and more than 40 convictions have been contained.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a> 

<p>In Florida, state law enforcement agents teamed up with the FBI, and following a two-month
period of communication on America Online, in which an undercover agent posed as a 14-year-old boy, three men, all of whom met over the computer network, were arrested on charges of
arranging to have sex with boys.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a> One of the men is also accused of "sending several obscene
computer images of naked children and adults having sex with children."<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>

<p>National Public Radio's program, <em>All Things Considered</em>, broadcast a story entitled "FBI
Investigates Kid Porn on the Internet," in which the following examples of one of the FBI on-line
pedophile sting operations were cited: One undercover FBI agent received eight images of naked
boys, some having oral sex, two hours after he logged onto America Online and posted a request
for pictures of children engaged in sex. The FBI was then able to identify and arrest the sender of
the images. The sting operation also nabbed a 32-year-old patent lawyer from Arlington,
Virginia, who logged onto America Online and arranged to meet what he thought was a 14-year-old girl in a nearby shopping mall. Upon walking into the mall, the man was arrested by an FBI
agent.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a> This sting operation was partially the result of a court order received by the FBI to
monitor some e-mail traffic on AOL. The court order came after AOL contacted the FBI
following a report by one of AOL's members saying that the member had received e-mail with
pornographic material attached.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>

<p>The Internet is fast becoming a useful and popular tool for not only police departments and the
FBI, but for numerous other authorities who help enforce laws. James J. Laski, a City Clerk has
taken advantage of the latest in computer technology to pioneer the Kids Identification System.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>
Parents of missing children will be able to take advantage of this free and revolutionary plan by
having information, photographs, and videotape of their youngsters instantly dispersed, via e-mail, to law enforcement agencies and news media.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a> The Securities and Exchange Commission
has also turned to the Internet in its fight against unscrupulous stock promoters and other
fraudulent investment-related activity.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a> In addition to establishing a unit to browse the web for
fraudulent promoters, the SEC has used its web site to post a cautionary brochure that warns
investors to be alert to Internet securities fraud.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a> Also, in the fight against cargo theft,
authorities have decided to take advantage of the Internet.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a> Cargo TIPS (Theft Information
Process System) compiles details from reported cargo crimes and makes the information
available via Internet to the freight community and law enforcement agencies.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a> The system
encourages the exchange of information with an interactive bulletin board and provides such
information as quarterly cargo theft statistical reports and alerts as to the latest cargo crime hot
spots and the most vulnerable commodities.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=CRIME FIGHTING>III. HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR ARE WORKING TOGETHER AND UTILIZING THE INTERNET TO FIGHT CRIME</strong></A>

<p>While law enforcement has, on its own, learned many ways to take advantage of the capabilities
offered by the Internet, the private sector is learning that it too can use the Internet to assist law
enforcement. The family of slain ophthalmologist Deborah Iverson, for example, is using the
Internet to draw national attention to the unsolved murder.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a> First of all, her husband, Dr. Robert
Iverson posted messages on three law enforcement forums and an investigative reporter's
forum.<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a> Dr. Iverson then made plans to create a home page that will include his slain wife's
photograph and the latest information about the case.<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a> To find law enforcement forums like the
ones that Dr. Iverson posted messages on, a person can access the Complete Directory of Law
Officer's Home Pages at--http://www.xensei.com/users hubcom/police.htm--.<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a> 

<p>Other private individuals like Barry Crimmins have done their part in using the Internet to assist
law enforcement. Mr. Crimmins had heard of the Internet being used to deal in child
pornography, but he didn't really think that such criminal acts actually could take place in
Cyberspace, so he decided to see for himself.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a> After going undercover to track child
pornography on the Internet, he informed the FBI of what he had found and then went to
Congress with it.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a> Crimmins told the Senate Judiciary Committee, "I am here to tell the
American people that not only are their children unsafe on America Online, their children are
unsafe because of it."<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>

<p>Not only are individuals stepping up and using the Internet to aid law enforcement, but so are
businesses and organizations. A company named Inventory Locator Service Inc. has used the
Internet to make available its data base of stolen aircraft parts.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a> Purchasers of aircraft parts can
now go on-line to see if the part they are buying is one of the nearly 7000 items in the file that
have been reported stolen to either law enforcement agencies or airline security departments
throughout the world.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a> Also joining in the Internet fight against crime, the National Consumers
League (NCL) has set up a program called Internet Fraud Watch to monitor, report, and prevent
on-line fraud.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a> With funding in the form of a grant from MasterCard International, NCL will be
able to staff Internet Fraud Watch forty-two and one-half hours a week with counselors that will
field calls about alleged incidents of on-line fraud and then immediately report the information to
appropriate law enforcement authorities.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a> Another such organization that is really taking
advantage of the Net is the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a> On-line for
more than a year now, the center says its most important tool is a child's picture and that "By
being on-line we can update pictures and change information automatically."<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>

<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=CONTROVERSY>IV. CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING LAW ENFORCEMENT'S USE OF THE INTERNET</strong></A>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>One of the hottest cyber-debates raging right now involves something called "encryption." In
short, encryption is a way to help keep electronic data secure. Governments see unrestricted
encryption as a threat to their autonomy and ability to properly protect citizens. Much of the
cyber-public, however, has a much different angle on the issue. Internet enthusiasts see
encryption more as a way for them to protect themselves rather than as a hindrance to the
government providing protection for the public. Government arguments for regulating encryption
range from claiming that such regulation is needed to provide for the nation's defense against
international terrorists to claiming that they need to be able to obtain a search warrant and have
the ability to monitor personal e-mail communications of suspected criminals.

<p>What exactly is encryption, and what does it involve? The following excerpt from <em>PC</em> <em>World</em>
explains an encryption system called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) that uses a technique known as
public key cryptology and was developed by Phillip Zimmerman:

<p>  [PGP] lets you encode your messages or hard disk files with a hard-to-break, two-part code.
You publish the public half of your encryption key for all and sundry to see (if you read Usenet
postings or subscribe to an Internet mailing list, you've probably seen plenty of these in the
signature text at the close of messages). You keep the secret part to yourself. When you want to
send a private message, you encrypt it using the recipient's public key, after which only the
recipient will be able to decrypt the message with their secret key. You can also use PGP to
attach an encrypted code (or digital signature) to a nonencrypted file or message, which lets
recipients verify that the message really came from you.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As the debate heats up over what if any restrictions or regulations are appropriate on
cryptography, private industry and the Internet community are coming down heavily on the side
opposite the government and law enforcement. Two groups, the Internet Architecture Board
(IAB) and the Internet Engineering Steering Group (ISEG) say they find no benefit to weakening
or restricting encryption since access to adequate cryptographic technology is "a key factor in the
growth of the Internet as a motor for international commerce and communications," and since
government restrictive policies "are against the interests of consumers and the business
communities."<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a> The groups also dismiss claims that government cryptography restrictions are
necessary for military security and the benefit of law enforcement agencies.<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a> 

<p>The FBI, the Justice Department, and the National Security Agency are adamant about their need
to be able to conduct electronic surveillance to track illegal activity and national security threats
as we enter the Information Age.<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a> FBI director Louis J. Freeh cited an example that he believes
illustrates the need for encryption regulation: After a child pornography sting operation resulted
in more than 125 raids and the seizure of hundreds of computers and computer diskettes across
the country from people suspected of using America Online to deal in child pornography, only 15
arrests were reported because the FBI allegedly could not unscramble the encrypted computer
files to view potentially incriminating pictures.<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>

<p>Current law applies military regulations to the export of encryption software, limiting such
exported software to a maximum 40-bit code.<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a> "Since 1992, Commerce Department regulations
have classified computer encryption as a weapon, because of its power to shield potentially
harmful data from law enforcement."<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a> Steve Young, an electronic-commerce analyst at Input, a
market-research firm, says "The reason the government lets people sell 40-bit encryption abroad
is because they know the can break into it."<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a> Under the current law, a person can use 128-bit
encryption in the United States, but it is illegal for an American company sell the software
internationally unless the exporter gives the U.S. government the keys to break the code.<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a> 

<p>The Clinton administration tried and failed to push through Congress a "Clipper chip" scheme
that would have given law enforcement back-door access into encrypted files.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a> The plan would
mandate that American computer manufacturers embed a special decoding chip into every
machine they make.<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a> After much public outrage from industry representatives and civil
libertarians Vice President Al Gore withdrew the plan.<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a> 

<p>The Clinton administration later altered the idea and unveiled a new scheme called "key
escrow."<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a> This approach focuses on encryption software rather than the machines themselves. It
would force American software designers to give encryption program keys to a federally
authorized third party that would hold the codes.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a> Then, upon obtaining a search warrant, law
enforcement agencies would be able to access the key that would allow encrypted data to be
decoded.<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a> The plan is very similar to the system of "Trusted Third Parties," favored by the U.K.
government.<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a> The U.K. system, however, would rely on the third party to provide the
cryptographic keys in the first place as well as keep the keys secret.<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a> The Internet Architecture
Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering Steering Group (ISEG) warn that "Keys used for
signatures and authentication must never be escrowed. Any third party with access to such keys
could impersonate the legitimate owner, creating new opportunities for fraud and deceit."<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>

<p>Not only is the President's key escrow plan facing significant opposition, but the current
government restrictions on the export of encryption software are under strong attack. Bob Dole
has publicly supported a bill introduced by Senators Conrad Burns (R-Montana), and Patrick J.
Leahy (D-Vermont) that would repeal the encryption export restrictions entirely.<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a> The bill has
bipartisan support with four of the 13 original co-sponsors being Democrats.<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a> In addition, the
legislation's chances were bolstered with the release of a report recommending that encryption
export controls be relaxed.<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a> This report was the result of "a blue-ribbon commission of the
National Research Council, an arm of three quasi-federal science agencies--the National
Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine."<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a>
But White House resistance to the regulation roll-back has been so strong, and the pressure so
great, that many observers consider the bill dead for this year.<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a> The only aspect of this debate
that seems to be certain is that we see no sign that the controversy surrounding encryption of data
will soon subside.

<p>Another area of controversy concerning law enforcement's use of the Internet deals with 20-year-old Justice Department guidelines.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a> In 1976, following a series of Senate hearings revealing
that the FBI had been spying on private groups, Attorney General Edward Levi issued the
guidelines.<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a> As interpreted by FBI officials in 1996, the guidelines restrict the bureau from
recording the names and addresses of people who's Internet traffic shows they are preparing for
war with the federal government.<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a> Hate messages and other disturbing Internet traffic may be
observed on the Internet, but agents may not store data that is not publicly available information
unless they think the law is being broken.<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a> Despite privacy concerns, some polls have indicated
that a majority of Americans think the government should take more aggressive action in dealing
with hate groups.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>

<p>Another controversial issue concerning law enforcement's use of the Internet deals with the
Fourth Amendment and how it should be applied to digital contraband. The Fourth Amendment
provides

<p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon
probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be
searched, and the persons or things to be seized.<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Law student Michael Adler hypothesizes a technically feasible Net-wide search that he calls a
"perfect search" and that could provide some difficult Fourth-Amendment questions for
constitutional minds: The search is one for digital contraband, and it is a search that is unusual in
that it does not involve a human investigator. A computer program can be designed to search
through a hard drive and report only on the presence or absence of certain digital contraband such
as a particular piece of child pornography or a piece of illegally modified software. Such an
object-targeted search program would require an exact copy of the target digital contraband, and
it would ignore everything that was not the specific target. The search could be run Net-wide and
would have minimal impact on property, produce no false positives, not need to be noticeable,
and would reveal nothing to officials beyond the identity of some individuals who possess the
particular piece of digital contraband.<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a>

<p>Adler then examines how the Fourth Amendment might treat such a search: The modern
Supreme Court Approach to Fourth Amendment issues utilizes a balancing test in which the
government's interest in a search is weighed against the costs of the search's invasion of privacy.
This test, as laid out in <em>Katz v. United States</em><a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a> focuses on collateral damages, and "where the
court finds no collateral damages, it is unlikely to find a violation of privacy." Because of the
unique characteristics involved in the "perfect search," and because of the Court's articulated
reasoning concerning "collateral damage," no possible claim of collateral damage exists in the
Net-wide search hypothesized by Adler. Consequently, an officer running such a Net-wide
program would not be conducting a Fourth Amendment Search.<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a>

<p>Adler proposes that a new balancing test is needed to protect citizens' autonomy and refuge from
the government.<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a> Regardless of how one feels about this particular issue or the other
controversial issues discussed above, the fact is that the proliferation of the Internet will spark
much controversy, and law enforcement's use of the Internet is no exception.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><A NAME=FUTURE>V. THE FUTURE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT'S USE OF THE INTERNET</strong></A>

<p>Most all indications point to a future in which use of the Internet, including law enforcement's
use, will significantly expand. CYLINK, a firm specializing in information security and wireless
communications, has compiled data showing that "the Internet had an estimated 1 million
subscribers in 1988. Today, 25 million or more now access the Internet worldwide. Within five
years, that number is expected to grow by 100 million."<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a> Another sign of Internet growth is the
National Information Infrastructure (NII), which began in 1993 with a report by Vice President
Al Gore that outlined his on-line futuristic vision of a worldwide, computer-based
communications network.<a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a> No one knows what all the NII will someday include, but the
possibilities are seemingly endless. For now, the infrastructure is being developed and deployed
by private-sector companies, academic institutions, government agencies (including law
enforcement), and trade organizations.<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>

<p>Law enforcement is also visibly gearing up for large growth in their use of the Internet. Studies
by G2 Research Inc., a Mountain View, California market-research firm, show that "state and
local law enforcement agencies spent $992 million in 1995 on hardware, software and
information technology services," and that spending is expected to increase 18 percent per year,
to $2.3 billion by the year 2000.<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a> The recent $7.5 billion federal COPS program has made
Internet-related technology a big impetus, allowing local departments to use grant money to buy
computer systems.<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a>

<p>The ongoing upgrade of the FBI's central repository of criminal records--the National Crime
Information Center, known as NCIC 2000--is another factor. Scheduled to go on line in 1998,
NCIC 2000 will, among other things, allow state and local police departments with a modern
telecommunications infrastructure to access more than 43 million digitized fingerprints and
conduct speedy database searches of 30 million criminal histories.<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>

<p>Commenting on the future of the Internet, Sergeant Doug Godwin, of the Oakland University
Police Department sums it all up this way: "It's probably the wave of the future for law
enforcement. Forward-thinking people who can see beyond the immediate uses are what makes
this so exciting."<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a>
</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><strong><A NAME=CONCLUSION>VI. CONCLUSION</strong></A>

<p>We live at a time which will quite possibly be looked back on as the very beginning of the
Information Age--a pivotal point in history during which the way we live our day-to-day lives
was drastically transformed. The one tool that will likely be credited with bringing about this
change more so than any other single tool will arguably be the Internet. As we are just beginning
to witness the proliferation of the Internet and the ways in which it impacts our lives, law
enforcement has decided that it will not be left out of the growing numbers of people, businesses,
and government agencies that have chosen to ride the wave of the future. 

<p>From small local police departments who set up a web site with only a mission statement and a
picture of the chief for public relations purposes, to the FBI's NCIC 2000, which will offer
instant access to 43 million sets of fingerprints, law enforcement is learning to utilize the
seemingly endless possibilities offered by the Internet. The Internet has provided ways to
effectively involve the general public in the complicated process of enforcing the law. The Net
has also provided criminals with new ways to perpetrate crimes. As law enforcement attempts to
stave off such high-tech criminal activity, controversies arise over what the appropriate balance is
between letting the government do its job and, on the other hand, protecting the public from
unconstitutional governmental intrusion. No one knows for sure where the lines will finally be
drawn. One thing that is readily apparent, however, is that both the private sector and the public
sector, including law enforcement, are drastically expanding their use of the Internet.

<p align="center"><A NAME=INTRODUCTION>I.  Introduction</A>

<p>Technology is undoubtedly an integral part of everyday life.  As the Twentieth Century draws to
a close, professionals are more dependent on the development and use of technology and
computers.  The legal profession is no exception.  The technological innovations such as
computers and electronic research have greatly simplified many lawyers' daily routines.  For
instance, personal computers have replaced filing cabinets, and floppy disks and magnetic tape
have replaced bulky paper files.  Accounting systems have simplified the billing process, and e-mail has increased office communications.  Case management software has made lawyers' case
preparation time more efficient.  Also, the availability of electronic research through LEXIS,
WestLaw, and the Internet has lessened the need for extensive law office libraries and has put a
wealth of information at lawyers' fingertips.  Could such technology also help the court system
become more efficient?  The answer, according to the information contained in this paper, is
"YES."

<p>This paper explores the technology available to the courts in several parts:  Part II deals with the
current technology that courts can utilize; Part III examines Courtroom 21, a prototype courtroom
for the future; and Part IV explores the use of the Internet for the courts, and includes
developments already used by courts across the nation.  To conclude, this paper includes a
prediction for the direction of courtroom technology for the next century in Part V.  The
information contained in this paper will demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages associated
with the technology that is available to the legal system.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=CURRENT>II.  Current Technology Available to Courts

<p>Legal professionals have been quite slow and cautious to accept the available technology in their
practices.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  The court system has been even slower.  However, several advances in technology,
such as increased speed and availability, have spurred the demand for use of this technology in
the courts.  The following section shows the current technology waiting for widespread use in the
court system.  

<p align="center"><A NAME=USING>A.  Using TV's and Computers in Court</A>

<p>Effective presentation is the heart of communication -- this is a well-known fact to most lawyers. 
The use of televisions and computers in court definitely aid in effective presentation.  Charts,
diagrams, photographs, computer animation, and computer graphics can now be used as
informative as well as persuasive tools.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  

<p>The use of television and computers in the courtroom has gained importance for several reasons. 
First, televisions and computers allow lawyers to store, organize, and present large quantities of
information to the court in a rather inexpensive and simple format.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>    Through the use of
computers at the counsel table, trial records, such as interrogatories and depositions, can be at the
attorneys' disposal.  Attorneys could store the evidence and information via the computer instead
of hauling files and boxes into a courtroom.  Also, television monitors are an obvious necessity
when replaying videotaped evidence or videotaped depositions.

<p>Secondly, lawyers can portray courtroom information as pictures or graphics in an inexpensive
manner.  This is important since scientific studies report that people, such as jurors or even
judges, are persuaded more by visual images and are more likely to remember visual images than
other forms of information.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  For this reason, litigators are obviously attracted to the persuasive
effect of computer graphics or videotapes.

<p>Third, some information that previously could not be effectively used in the courtroom can now
be presented through the use of computer-related output.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  For example, scientific and
engineering data via computer graphics and computer animation can illustrate how and why a
certain incident took place.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  Also, computer graphics can visually explain and summarize the
testimony of witnesses, which would be especially effective during closing arguments.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>

<p>The use of televisions and computers in the courtrooms would obviously enhance opening and
closing statements as well as the presentation of evidence; however, this technology may present
certain hurdles for courtrooms and lawyers alike.  For instance, should courtrooms provide
certain equipment like television monitors and computer terminals?<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>  Taxpayers would have to
fund the investment in such equipment, and there is always the risk that equipment bought today
could be obsolete within a month or a year.  Furthermore, even if a specific courtroom had
technological capabilities, integration of the various software programs used by different lawyers
could not always be guaranteed.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

<p>Moreover, the prejudicial and evidentiary effects of this technology could pose problems as well. 
The counsel using computer graphics for the presentation of scientific information would have to
properly lay the evidentiary foundation.  However, this foundation, which would have to include
an explanation of scientific data and assumptions along with how the computer program analyzed
the data for the graphical presentation before the court, could prove overly burdensome and
complicated for jurors.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>  Also, trial judges would have to use discretion in deciding whether the
presentation of computer graphics constitutes a mere illustration or re-creation of the evidence in
the case.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>

<p>Perhaps the greatest obstacle to computer generated court presentations is the question of
prejudicial weight.  Conceivably, attorneys could use computer graphics and animation for effect
in a way similar to a movie director.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>  Again court discretion would have to govern.  But how
much weight would a jury place on a well-produced presentation as compared to the traditional
presentation on the merits?  Such a question can only be answered by testing and experience.

<p>As will be demonstrated in later sections of this paper, televisions and computer technology can
be used in a variety of ways in the courtroom.  Despite the drawbacks discussed above, the use of
such technology will greatly enhance the communication process between attorneys and their
courtroom audiences.

<p align="center"><A NAME=VIDEO>B.  Videoconferencing</A>

<p>The use of videoconferencing can also enhance the communication aspects in the courtroom as
well as increase court efficiency and safety.  Videoconferencing basically allows communication
between multiple participants at different locations.  The equipment needed for
videoconferencing includes television cameras, monitors, microphones, speakers, and a
communications network.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  More complex systems can connect users of personal computers
through wiring, software, local area networks, and cameras mounted on the personal computer
monitor.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>  Courts can use this technology in a variety of different situations.

<p>Criminal courts often perform brief arraignments for criminal defendants, and usually the
incarcerated defendants have to be transported from the jail to the courthouse.  The transporting
of criminal defendants not only poses efficiency and cost-related problems, but it also poses
safety concerns, such as the possible escape of a prisoner or possible assault of court
participants.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  Courts can use videoconferencing, or remote arraignments, to alleviate these
concerns.  

<p>Remote arraignments are usually conducted by two-way camera systems with the defendant
staying in jail and the judge and prosecution staying in the courtroom.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>  Defense counsel may
either be in the courtroom or in the jail with the defendant.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>  Videoconferencing has proven
successful for cost efficiency for the jurisdictions in which it has been used, and this technology
seems to be gaining in popularity across the nation.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>  In fact, some jurisdictions have approved
of remote arraignments by drafting statutes through their state legislatures.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>  However, most of
the jurisdictions that are using videoconferencing have restricted the use of this technology to
prisoner arraignments.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>

<p>Remote arraignments by videoconferencing do have limitations.  For instance, attorneys have
complained that videoconferencing takes out the human element in these hearings.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>  Physical
separation between court members and the defendant depersonalizes the proceedings.  Also,
some judges have complained that videoconferencing has less of a deterrent effect since criminal
defendants do not have to make an actual court appearance.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>

<p>The main concern with remote arraignments is the adequacy of legal representation.  This
concern manifests itself when the defense counsel is not at the jail during the videoconference. 
In order for a lawyer to meet the ethical duties of zealous representation, the lawyer must
thoroughly advise the client before the arraignment or else have an associate counsel available at
the jail during the hearing<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>.  Such representation might prove difficult for public defenders who
find it more convenient to stay near the courthouse to be available for plea bargaining with the
prosecutor.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>  Furthermore, even if the defense counsel could advise his/her client via
videoconferencing, confidential communications would be chilled since the arraignment would
be on the public record.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>

<p>Although videoconferencing is mainly used in remote arraignments, the technology can also be
used for a variety of other courtroom tasks.  Videoconferencing allows witnesses from remote
locations to join the court proceedings.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>  Also, sensitive testimony from children and victims
can be procured in a less intrusive manner than that of courtroom testimony.  Another area in
which courts could use videoconferencing is by allowing judges and attorneys to meet from their
own respective offices.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>  These videoconferences could curtail the time attorneys spend in
conferences with judges and with other attorneys, which would in turn reduce litigation costs and
possibly allow cases to be resolved quicker.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>  In sum, videoconferencing allows the courts and
attorneys to provide better service with less time, distance, and communication restraints.

<p align="center"><A NAME=LEGAL>C.  Legal Research on the Bench and at Counsel Tables</A>

<p>The availability of electronic legal research has become a commonplace feature of law offices;
however, such technology is rarely available in the courtroom since most courthouses have at
least basic law libraries.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>  If a judge were to have the capabilities of on-line research at the
bench, the court would have immediate verification of the applicability of certain case law or
legislative enactments to the current case before the court.  The judge would no longer have to
recess in order to consult a case or to perform pertinent legal research; consequently, trials could
be more efficient and less costly in the long run.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>  Also, counsel would be held accountable for
their cited legal authorities since the judge could immediately comprehend the relevance or
irrelevance of the presented case law to the case at hand.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>  

<p>The availability of electronic research in the courtroom does have its problems.  The first and
most obvious problem would be financial constraint.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>  Even though there are various forms of
electronic research available, attorneys widely rely on services like LEXIS and WestLaw, which
bill by the hour.  Private attorneys in a civil lawsuit usually bill this electronic research to their
respective clients.  However, use of these services by judges, prosecutors, and public defenders
would have to be billed to the public or else assessed to both parties or to the losing party.

<p>Another drawback to the use of electronic research in the courtroom is the possibility of 
confrontation due to differing interpretation of legal text.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>  This, of course, proves to be a minor
concern since attorneys could certainly preserve the issue on appeal as they would any other
controversial ruling.  

<p>The advantages to electronic research capabilities in the courtroom via computer terminals at
counsels' tables and on the bench far outweigh the above mentioned minor drawbacks.  This
technology would not have to drastically change courtroom procedure or litigation.  Moreover,
the cost and time benefits that accompany the immediate retrieval of legal information would
help to streamline legal proceedings and promote long term legal efficiency.

<p align="center"><A NAME=REAL>D.  Real-Time Capabilities

<p>  The use of real-time technology is quickly gaining acceptance in the courtroom.  As the name
"real-time" suggests, this technology allows interactive communication and near instantaneous
records of court proceedings.  Real-time capabilities are especially useful for courtroom
transcription.

<p>In the past, timely transcription of courtroom proceedings or even depositions proved to be
problematic, and the distribution of the written record ended up being very costly.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>  Real-time
transcription alleviates some of these problems by utilizing computer-aided transcription
equipment to produce a working transcript as the proceedings take place.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>  The computer-aided
transcription equipment is a sophisticated version of traditional transcription machines.  As the
reporter enters the testimony through a computerized stenography machine, the computer's
dictionary matches the entry with words in computer memory or with words identifiable through
the use of software.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>  The record can then be stored in the computer hardware, on floppy disk,
in printed form, and on traditional paper tape.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>  The use of this technology produces almost
immediate transcripts with close to 99% accuracy.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>

<p>The true benefit of real-time transcription is the ability to transmit and distribute the record to
judges, attorneys, members of the jury, members of the courtroom, and perhaps even members of
an outside viewing audience, like the media or other interested trial watchers.  For instance,
hearing-impaired members of the court may view concurrent computer-displayed transcription
during the proceedings.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>  Also, real-time transcription allows both lawyers and judges to obtain
an electronic version of the transcript.  The transcript can be stored in each party's personal
computer and independently marked for further trial preparation.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>  Moreover,  judges can
quickly rule on testimony disputes and draft jury instructions by consulting the real-time
transcript.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>  And, as real-time transcription technology progresses, the entire transcript of a
court proceeding can be sent electronically over the phone line to an attorneys office or even to
an appellate court for consultation.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>

<p>Real-time transcription does demand a few particulars for its proper use.  The first demand is a
court reporter who is trained in this technology.  Since real-time transcription is still very new,
employment of trained real-time court reporters could prove rather costly.  However, as training
becomes prevalent, the premium hiring salaries will undoubtedly decrease and make electronic
transcripts more efficient and more available.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a> 

<p>Secondly, real-time transcription demands the use of computers, especially in the courtroom.  In
order for this technology to be fully utilized in the courtroom, computers must be available for
the court reporter, counsel, the judge, and any hearing impaired participant.  The demand for
computers in the courtroom again raises the questions of how equipped courtrooms need to be,
how much such equipment would cost, and who would pay for this technology.  Although these
questions may impose temporary setbacks to the widespread use of real-time transcription, the
benefits of time and cost efficiency could make this technology indispensable for courts in the
near future.

<p align="center"><A NAME=ELECTRONIC>E.  Electronic Filing</A>

<p>Electronic filing is another technology that could promote great efficiency and streamlining of
the business processes of the court.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>  This technology would reduce the need for attorneys to
file hard copy documents with the court clerk.  Attorneys, legal assistants, and law clerks would
no longer have to run to the courthouse before 5:00 p.m., to file a document or to amend previous
filings with the court.  Conceivably, attorneys could interact and file documents with the court
twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a> 

<p>Prince George's County, Maryland, and Andersen Consulting, L.L.P., are testing electronic filing
through a software system called Justice<em>LINK</em>.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>    This public/private partnership has used
electronic filing only in motor tort and foreclosure cases, but the benefits of the system are
already apparent.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>  For instance, electronic filing reduced the 122 steps required to docket a
foreclosure case to final judgment down to 97 steps; the court believes that this 28 percent
reduction could increase to 50 percent or more with the full use of electronic filing.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>  In
addition, Judge Arthur M. Ahalt of Prince George's County Circuit Court acknowledges that
electronic filing systems allow judges better access to case files and evidence, which, in turn,
allows judges to spend more time administering justice.<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>    Moreover, the use of electronic
filing systems software allows the court to maintain control and security of the incoming case
data.<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>  Finally, the system used by Prince George's County compensates for those attorneys
who do not utilize computers by having scanning and communications equipment to place such
filings in the Justice<em>LINK</em> system.<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>

<p>Other courts are also utilizing electronic filing.  In fact, federal courts in Ohio and New York
have fully implemented systems that receive electronically filed bankruptcy cases.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>

<p>The obvious drawback to electronic filing is financial constraint.  Systems such as Justice<em>LINK</em>
require intricate software and networking capabilities, which are quite expensive with current
technology.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>  Electronic filing also requires the courts to have actual personal computers
available for at least the clerks and judges.  Moreover, those staff members and judges using the
system would have to be carefully trained for the efficient and accurate use of the system.<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a> 
Again, the question arises as to who pays for this software, hardware, and training.  Also,
subscription to the electronic filing system to outside attorneys may initially prove to be cost
prohibitive.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>  However, as popularity and technology progress, these costs will surely diminish. 
The proponents of electronic filing expect the drawbacks associated with the use of such
technology to be temporary and consequential when compared to the time and cost savings of
connecting the court with attorneys and the public.

<p align="center"><A NAME=VOICE>F.  Voice Technology:  Speech Recognition and Voice Response</A>

<p>Voice technology can also be effectively used in the courts.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>  Although this technology is still
relatively new, speech recognition and voice response systems can improve court staff efficiency
while opening communication between the court system and the general public.  

<p align="center"><A NAME=SPEECH>(1)  Speech Recognition</A>

<p>Speech recognition systems use personal computers, microphones, and specialized speech
recognition software to interpret and store audible information as if the data had been entered by
the computer keyboard.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a>  The computer analyzes the words spoken by the user and compares
and matches the sounds with words listed in the software dictionary.  Words can be added by the
user if the computer can not find a match in its existing dictionary.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>  As new words are added to
the computer's vocabulary, the speech recognition software applies artificial intelligence
capabilities to allow the computer to "learn" from its mistakes.<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>  The accuracy of speech
recognition programs is still less that 100 percent; however, the dictionaries in the software for
this technology have greatly increased in language capacity, and the speed of recognition is
moving close to normal speaking pace of 120 words per minute.<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>  Also, as this technology
develops, word spotting could become incidental to phrase and concept spotting, which would in
turn lead to continuous speech recognition without the use of a keyboard.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>

<p>Speech recognition could prove quite useful in the courts because it allows data entry while the
user is performing other tasks.  Also, a specialized labor force would no longer be necessary;
amateur typists could perform the duties once delegated to professional secretaries without
having to use the computer keyboard.<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>  This technology would also allow disabled persons to
perform tasks that had previously required the use of a computer keyboard.<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a> 

<p>Since speech recognition is still relatively new and untested, this technology has its
disadvantages.  Currently, speech recognition capabilities are limited to single-word recognition,
and this technology is further limited by the size of the software dictionary of the system.<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a> 
Also, the systems are still quite slow in the recognition of words per minute; skilled typists and
secretaries may find manual data entry to be the fastest means of entering information into the
computer system.<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>  In addition, the current speech recognition technology is still quite cost
prohibitive, which again poses the questions of how much should the court invest in developing
software and hardware that could become obsolete in a short period of time, and how will the
court pay for such technology.  As technological advances become reality, however, perhaps
speech recognition will become a more viable option for court efficiency programs.

<p align="center"><A NAME=RESPONSE>(2) Voice Response</A>

<p>Voice response systems allow people to access information through a network of computer
hardware and software that is connected to a telephone system.<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a>  Voice response systems can
effectively link the public to the court.  A caller can access prerecorded information by using a
touch-tone phone and following the menu choices provided by the system.  The caller can access
general court information, such as location and jury information, or the caller can access more
specific information, such as case status and docket calendar through the court's case
management system.<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>  Sophisticated systems can facilitate credit card payments of traffic
tickets or filing fees.<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>

<p>Several jurisdictions are successfully utilizing voice response technology in the court system. 
For example, Michigan courts have provided callers with a range of court-related information
since 1989.  Also, citizens in Arizona, Florida, and Missouri can access child support
information, such as whether payments have been sent, by entering their case number into the
system.  California traffic violators can use voice response systems to access information about
their tickets, sign up for traffic school, and pay their fines by credit card.  Moreover, Florida
courts allow some attorneys to schedule hearings with certain judges by entering an attorney code
along with a time and date preference.<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>

<p>Voice response technology facilitates public access to the courts by providing answers to
commonly asked questions 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>  Not only does the system allow
court staff members to devote more time to complex problems and questions, but it also saves
callers business and travel expenses by being able to access the system at any time.  Also, this
technology could be programmed in several different languages to overcome previously
restrictive language barriers.<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a>

<p>As with any new technology, voice response systems have flaws.  First, an extremely complex
system with too many menu choices could be confusing to the user; similarly, if the information
is presented in smaller menus, accessing the system might take too long and prove frustrating to
the user.<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>  Also, systems that integrate with multi-line telephone and computer systems can
prove costly when coupled with programming costs to keep the system updated.<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>  Another
problem is security, especially with systems that take credit card payments.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>  Courts utilizing
this technology would have to take additional safeguards and precautions in order to protect the
integrity of the voice response system as well as the users who access the technology.   Perhaps
the most prevalent defect in voice response systems is the lack of the human element -- many
people simply would rather talk to another person than to a computer.<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a>  However, this concern
may become secondary if more people adapt to using this technology in their everyday lives.   

<p align="center"><A NAME=IMAGING>G.  Imaging</A>

<p>Courts can store documents as electronic photographs through a process called imaging.<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a>  This
technology helps courts manage efficiency and productivity in working with files and documents. 
Imaging utilizes computers, scanners, document and case management software, printers, and
communications networks.<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>  Once a document has been filed with the court, the court staff
takes an electronic picture by scanning the document; then, the staff indexes the image through
the court's case management system; and finally, the document is stored electronically on
magnetic or optical disks.<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>  The documents are routed to various court staff members through
workflow programs based on the assigned indexing code.<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a> 

<p>Courts have experimented with imaging since the late 1980s, and this technology has proved
popular with the judicial branch.<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a>  Since imaging stores the picture of an original document
electronically, court records and cases can be accessed by multiple users at the same time;  this
feature makes every document available no matter which court personnel is working on a case. 
Imaging also decreases the possibility that original documents could be lost or misfiled since the
original paper documents would not have to leave the filing room.<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a>  Also, the original paper
files can be archived after a case has been closed through magnetic files and CD-ROM, which
can store tens of thousands of pages on a single disk.<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a>  Furthermore, court staff productivity
should increase since information and electronic files can be accessed quickly.<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a>

<p>The limitations of imaging technology start with financial constraints.  Since this technology is a
supplement to case management systems, imaging programs must be integrated with existing
systems, which proves to be very expensive and time consuming.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a>  Courts that do use
computers may experience considerable inconveniences if conversion efforts incapacitate court
operations.<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a>  Furthermore, text management systems might be a more cost efficient alternative
to imaging.<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a>  Text documents take less storage space than imaging, and the search and retrieval
of text has proven superior to imaging retrieval.<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a>  In sum, courts may want to wait to use
imaging technology until it truly becomes a cost-effective means of accessing and storing court
documents.

<p align="center"><A NAME=KIOSKS>H.  Kiosks</A>

<p>Kiosks are computer workstations through which users can access court information and services
without expending staff resources.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>  Kiosks are similar in appearance to automated teller
machines (ATMs) with a computer monitor enclosed in a steel or fiberglass casing; however,
kiosks have greater interactive and multimedia capabilities than conventional ATMs.<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a>  For
instance, kiosks have large video, music, voice, text, forms, and graphics files that a user can
access through a touch-screen video monitor.  The computer guides the user through the menu
choices by providing simple explanations of court processes and programs.<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a>  Users can also
choose the language with which they are most comfortable in accessing this information.<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a> 
From kiosk terminals, users can pay traffic tickets, calculate and pay alimony or child support,
schedule court appearances, enter pleas, and even complete standardized forms for such
proceedings as uncontested divorces.<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a>  

<p>Courts across the nation have utilized kiosks for public access to court processes.  Colorado first
used kiosks in 1987, which allowed the general public to access general court information as well
as child support and other small claims forms.<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a>  This system used simple graphics, employed
audio explanations in both English and Spanish, and became the impetus for later kiosk use in
other jurisdictions.<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a>

<p>Also, the Long Beach Municipal Court in California implemented Auto Clerk through the use of
two kiosks outside the courthouse.<a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a>  This program allowed public access 24 hours a day and 7
days a week for traffic ticket information, for ticket payment, and for scheduling of traffic
school.<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>  

<p>The Arizona Supreme Court and Administrative Office of the Courts use kiosks in several
different locations; this system, called QuickCourt, has been used on a trial basis since 1993. 
Recently, the Arizona Supreme Court officially implemented the system for state-wide use, and
the court estimates that 150 of the machines will be in operation by mid-1997.<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a>  These kiosks
are currently used for such functions as simple divorces, child-support calculations, and land-lord
tenant disputes.<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a> 

<p>Kiosks have immediate benefits on the court system.  Court staff members can concentrate on
more complex issues of the court since routine court proceedings can be handled through a kiosk
at any time of the day.<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>  Moreover, kiosks can sometimes provide better service than that
available at the court.  For instance, information accessed through the kiosk will be consistent
and correct from user to user; also, since a kiosk cannot discern age, gender, ethnicity, or
appearance, traditional language and racial barriers can be eliminated.<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a>  Kiosks provide the
public with an excellent and convenient way to understand and access the judicial system.
Moreover, general government kiosks may be used across the country in order to combine
important court functions with those of executive branch agency applications.<a href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a>

<p>Kiosks do have encumbrances to their use.  First, the location of kiosks may have to be dictated
by the services available on the computer.<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a>  For example, short transactions such as paying
traffic tickets can be accessed in places such as shopping malls or outside of the courthouse;
however, lengthy transactions, especially those needing personal information, should be accessed
in areas that have seating arrangements and privacy capabilities.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a> Furthermore, programming
and updating of kiosks could be cost prohibitive.<a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>  Also, kiosks lack the human contact quality
that many people still seek in accessing service.<a href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a>  Finally, security concerns arise with the
possibility of vandalism and destruction to the kiosks in remote areas from the courthouse.<a href="#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a> 
Despite these drawbacks, kiosks remain a viable alternative for courts to allow public access to
general court information while streamlining the functions of court staff members.

<p align="center"><A NAME=COURTROOM>III. Courtroom 21 -- The Courtroom of the Future</A>

<p>Courtroom 21, the most advanced courtroom in the United States, effectively uses current
technology to improve the judicial process for all participants involved.<a href="#N_107_"><sup>(107)</sup></a>  This courtroom is a
joint project of the College of William and Mary and the Court Technology Laboratory of the
National Center for State Courts.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate to legal practitioners
and court staff members the availability and possibilities of using technology in the courtroom; at
the same time, the project directors can document the results and implications of using such
technology.<a href="#N_108_"><sup>(108)</sup></a>  Courtroom 21 uses currently available and reasonably priced technology, and,
since Courtroom 21 is an on-going project, the technology currently used in the courtroom is
continuously updated and upgraded.<a href="#N_109_"><sup>(109)</sup></a>  

<p>Courtroom 21 has many of the technologies that have already been discussed in this paper.  First,
the courtroom employs simultaneous video recording of court proceedings by using ceiling-mounted cameras with voice-initiated switching.<a href="#N_110_"><sup>(110)</sup></a>  Courtroom 21 has five ceiling television
cameras and one camera in an isolate "cell-block" area, and each camera provides a different
perspective of the courtroom.  These perspectives turn into "windows" on multi-frame
televisions.<a href="#N_111_"><sup>(111)</sup></a>    Whenever someone in the courtroom speaks, the closest camera focuses in on
that person, and their image is displayed in the main frame of the television monitor.<a href="#N_112_"><sup>(112)</sup></a>  This
audio and visual technology also allows Courtroom 21 to perform remote arraignments.<a href="#N_113_"><sup>(113)</sup></a>  The
audio and video images can be viewed from several courtroom computer monitors, including
those in the jury box.<a href="#N_114_"><sup>(114)</sup></a>

<p>Secondly, Courtroom 21 has computers in the jury box that are "[t]ext-, graphics-, and TV-capable."<a href="#N_115_"><sup>(115)</sup></a>  The jury can use these computers to view documents, evidence, charts, diagrams,
pictures, real-time transcription, live or prerecorded video, and computer graphics.<a href="#N_116_"><sup>(116)</sup></a>  The use of
the jury box computers is for demonstrative purposes only so that jurors will not be unduly
distracted by the terminals.<a href="#N_117_"><sup>(117)</sup></a>  

<p>Another technological feature of Courtroom 21 is the availability of LEXIS legal research at the
bench and at counsel tables.<a href="#N_118_"><sup>(118)</sup></a>  This technology provides immediate access to case law and state
and federal statutes.  Such capabilities are especially beneficial when legal questions arise during
court proceedings;  instead of having to recess to consult legal resources, the judge and counsel
can consult the LEXIS database for immediate resolution of the legal question at hand.<a href="#N_119_"><sup>(119)</sup></a>  
Another feature of Courtroom 21 is the available technology of video deposition playback.<a href="#N_120_"><sup>(120)</sup></a> 
These video depositions can be played on TV monitors in the court, and this technology is useful
in impeaching witness testimony and in presenting expert witness testimony.<a href="#N_121_"><sup>(121)</sup></a>  Moreover, with
current technology, an attorney can have certain parts of a deposition played back for the courts
in a way similar to reading back testimony from the record.<a href="#N_122_"><sup>(122)</sup></a>

<p>Finally, Courtroom 21 has real-time court reporter transcription.  As discussed earlier, real-time
transcription provides an almost instantaneous copy of the court record.  The judges and
attorneys in Courtroom 21 receive the transcript by their personal computers, and the participants
can view and highlight the record for later use.<a href="#N_123_"><sup>(123)</sup></a>  The judge and counsel can also take a copy of
the record home by either saving it to their personal computers' hard drives or by saving the
information on a floppy disk.<a href="#N_124_"><sup>(124)</sup></a>  Moreover, the use of real-time transcription in Courtroom 21
allows hearing impaired participants to read the testimony on computer or television monitors
during the actual proceedings.<a href="#N_125_"><sup>(125)</sup></a>

<p>The use of technology in Courtroom 21 has made the future of technology in the courtroom a
close reality.  This program shows that courtrooms must change with the times and must provide
the most efficient and most cost effective service available.  Perhaps the best way to deal with
cost prohibitive technology in the courtroom is to follow the lead of the Courtroom 21 organizers
and form a coalition between the judiciary and private technology companies.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=SYSTEM>IV.  Using the Internet in the Court System</A>

<p>The remainder of this paper will focus on another technology that can be effectively used by the
court system -- the Internet.<a href="#N_126_"><sup>(126)</sup></a>  Courts can efficiently serve and educate the community by
utilizing on-line access to the courts.  Instead of having to go to the courthouse or listen to
prerecorded information over the telephone, people can access on-line information from their
own personal computers.<a href="#N_127_"><sup>(127)</sup></a>  Also, people with on-line access capabilities can download the
electronic court information to their personal computers or else simply print out a hard copy of
the results.<a href="#N_128_"><sup>(128)</sup></a>  Moreover, the people who access this court information can also access
educational materials concerning the court system without having to actually visit a
courthouse.<a href="#N_129_"><sup>(129)</sup></a>  

<p>On-line capabilities also save money for the courts.  On-line information and documents can be
accessed thousands of times without creating additional costs for the courts or for the parties
involved in a lawsuit.<a href="#N_130_"><sup>(130)</sup></a>  Also, people can access general information and answers to routine
questions by accessing the court on-line.  Moreover, the court information on the Internet
provides court staff with consistent information that can be easily accessed for their own use. 
Both of these factors allow the court staff to be more efficient and devote more time to complex
questions.<a href="#N_131_"><sup>(131)</sup></a>

<p>The court information that is posted over the Internet can range from general and simple
information to complex legal research and documents.  For instance, general court information
can educate the public on the roles, responsibilities, and functions of the court.<a href="#N_132_"><sup>(132)</sup></a>  This
information could include graphical information, such as maps to show location, and could also
include photographs of the courthouse and of the court personnel.<a href="#N_133_"><sup>(133)</sup></a>  Also, the court's web page
can display contact information along with telephone numbers and e-mail addresses so that
people can access general court information from specific people.<a href="#N_134_"><sup>(134)</sup></a>

<p>Complicated and specific information can also be accessed by legal practitioners with Internet
access.  Courts can list opinions and create opinion databases via the Internet.<a href="#N_135_"><sup>(135)</sup></a>   Also, the court
can receive and send large complex documents, such as local court rules, for less cost than that
associated with postal services.<a href="#N_136_"><sup>(136)</sup></a>  Using this technology, out-of-town lawyers can research the
court rules and practices of a certain jurisdiction.  In addition, such large documents can be
researched easier as an electronic document than just as a hardcopy through intensifiers and
word-searches.<a href="#N_137_"><sup>(137)</sup></a>  Moreover, courts can post calendars and dockets, and staff members can
effectively update the web page as the calendar changes.<a href="#N_138_"><sup>(138)</sup></a>  

<p>Although the Internet is an ideal way of accessing information from the courts, courts have been
hesitant to use this technology for official voice and security reasons.  Information and messages
sent over the Internet by the courts are basically official court communications.<a href="#N_139_"><sup>(139)</sup></a>  The Internet
has proved to be an informal place of access for subscribers; court personnel would have to be
constantly reminded that e-mail messages ultimately reflect on the image of the court and that
messages sent via e-mail should be as appropriate as letters sent on official letterhead.<a href="#N_140_"><sup>(140)</sup></a>  
Moreover, courts would have to closely monitor and approve the addition or removal of any
information from the court's web page.<a href="#N_141_"><sup>(141)</sup></a>  Also, poorly maintained web site information could
undermine court competence and public confidence.

<p>Security concerns are of utmost importance to courts using the Internet as a link to the public. 
Although the access of general court information would not be problematic, someone could
conceivably bypass security and access private records and information.<a href="#N_142_"><sup>(142)</sup></a>  This unlawful access
would implicate constitutional rights to privacy, especially in criminal cases in which sealed
information could be revealed.<a href="#N_143_"><sup>(143)</sup></a>  The public trust would lessen if private records can not be
guaranteed safe storage.<a href="#N_144_"><sup>(144)</sup></a>  These technological concerns can be addressed and conquered by
more technology, and the Internet can still emerge as viable courtroom technology.

<p>Many courts across the nation have constructed their own web pages so that Internet users can
access court information.  In fact most jurisdictions have on-line capabilities.<a href="#N_145_"><sup>(145)</sup></a>  One of the most
successful court web pages is the Internet presence of the Harris County Court, Texas, mantained
by webmaster Mr. Ed Gibler.<a href="#N_146_"><sup>(146)</sup></a>

<p>The Harris County web page is an example of how courts can post information on the Internet. 
The web page includes both general and specific information.  It provides information about the
courts, including names, phone numbers, and photographs of staff members.<a href="#N_147_"><sup>(147)</sup></a>  The page also
contains general juror information, and even includes real-time maps, traffic and weather
conditions, and restaurants in the courthouse vicinity.<a href="#N_148_"><sup>(148)</sup></a>  Specific information on the web page
includes the local rules for each court division.<a href="#N_149_"><sup>(149)</sup></a>  Internet users can also access the Harris
County Directory along with Texas Judiciary White Pages.<a href="#N_150_"><sup>(150)</sup></a>  In addition, lawyers and Internet
users alike can access the district court dockets via the Harris County's Justice Information
Worldwide Inquiry System (JIWIS).<a href="#N_151_"><sup>(151)</sup></a>

<p>There are other noteworthy aspects of the Harris County web page.  The page has desk references
which the user can access from the home page.  These references include the Harris County
Directory, the Commissioners' Court Agenda Mailing List, Webster's Dictionary, Roget's
Thesaurus, and the 'Lectric Law Library.<a href="#N_152_"><sup>(152)</sup></a>  The site also contains general information about
Harris County and about Houston, Texas.<a href="#N_153_"><sup>(153)</sup></a>  Furthermore, users can link up with various media
sites like ABC, NPR, the Houston Chronicle, the New York Times, or USA Today.<a href="#N_154_"><sup>(154)</sup></a>  This web
page is a pioneer and a prototype for other courts to follow.  The court information provided is
not so complex that it would alienate laypersons; the web page educates the public with
informative sites as well as sites of public interest.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME=CONCLUSION>V.  Conclusion</A>

<p>The availability of technology has undoubtedly changed the court system, and as technology
becomes more accessible, more courts will become automated.  Normal court operations will be
significantly streamlined, which will lead to greater efficiency.  However, at the present time,
there are legitimate cost, security, and technological concerns associated with the automation of
the court system.  Technology will make practicing law and trying cases easier for attorneys and
more accessible to the public; however, efficiency and streamlining reduce, and possibly
eliminate, the human factor.  Some employment positions will no longer be necessary.  But
judges, lawyers, and juries cannot be replaced by technology -- their lives will just be a bit easier.

<p align="center">I.<strong><A NAME = INTRODUCTION> Introduction</strong></A>

<p>The Internet is "a giant network which interconnects innumerable smaller groups of linked
computer networks.  It is thus a network of networks."<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  This network of computers allows
individuals who possess the proper equipment to communicate with others all over the world, as
well as retrieve information about any subject imaginable.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  Although the Internet has existed
for almost 30 years,  mainstream society has only been using it for the past few years.  The
Internet began as an experimental project implemented by the United States Department of
Defense to enable the military, defense contractors, and universities conducting defense-related
research to communicate with one another and electronically transfer data.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  Then, the Internet's
appeal caught the attention of university scholars and research facilities, and they began using the
Internet as a research tool.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  Finally, commercial companies such as IBM and Sprint realized the
Internet could be an extremely valuable tool for the average American, and the "Information
Superhighway" began to experience heavy traffic.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  Today, the Internet is a series of linked,
overlapping networks that connect computer users to others all over the globe.  "It is estimated
that as many as forty million individuals have access to the information and tools of the Internet
and that figure is expected to grow to 200 million by the year 1999."<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  <strong></strong>

<p>There are several different ways to communicate with others and retrieve information over the
Internet.  Probably the most common way individuals communicate with one another is through
e-mail.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  Another way to transmit or receive information via the Internet is through electronic
bulletin boards.  A third way to communicate through the global network is what many call
"chat."  Chatting allows an individual  to log into a "chat room" and participate in a live
conversation with other Internet users.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>  Perhaps the most common way a person may retrieve
information from the Internet is by searching the World Wide Web.  The World Wide Web
contains countless documents that are downloaded onto the Internet from individuals and
companies all over the world through Web server software.   Therefore, any  person with access
to a Web server may post his own web page.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>  A person may access information from the Web
by either typing in a specific address of a web page or by implementing a key-word search
through a web browser and search engine.  Once a person enters a web page, that page will often
contain links that will connect the user to other related web pages.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>

<p>  Since the Internet is a global network of computers and information and communication is not
disseminated from any one source, controlling what material may be found on the Internet is next
to impossible.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a><strong>  </strong>This is what makes the Internet such a unique, and potentially dangerous
medium.  The information found on the Internet is extremely diverse, ranging from intellectual
chat rooms and global chess matches to information on how to build a bomb and child
pornography.<strong></strong>

<p>Because the Internet is a fairly new advancement in computer technology, often children are
much more adept at accessing the Information Superhighway than are adults.  This creates a
dangerous situation because a child may know much more about finding hazardous information
via the Internet than his parents.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a><strong>  </strong>Although the Internet is an excellent learning tool for people
of all ages, children may also come across images on their monitor such as hard core
pornography, including child pornography, and can participate in sexually explicit chat while
"surfing the net."<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a><strong></strong>

<p>Protecting children from viewing these images and participating in this type of communication is
a main concern of many organizations and individuals, including parents, on-line service
providers, special interest groups, and even the United States Congress.  However, the question
is: how do we protect the children in our country from exposure to inappropriate material and
conversation that is disseminated by individuals from all over the world?

<p align="center"><A NAME = LEGISLATURE>II.  The Legislature's Answer: The Communications Decency Act of 1996<strong></strong></A>

<p>The Communications Decency Act (CDA) is a highly debated, temporarily unenforceable statute
that was amended to the Communications Act of 1938 on February 8, 1996.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>  The "new 
<em>s</em>223(d) purports to regulate not only how commercial purveyors of obscene or pornographic
materials may advertise and sell their products on line, but also how private individuals who
choose or exchange certain constitutionally protected communications with one another can do
so."<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a><strong>  </strong>The CDA states that an individual may be fined or jailed for up to two years if he:

<p>[I]n interstate or foreign communications by means of a telecommunications device, knowingly,
makes, creates, or solicits, and initiates the transmission of any comment, request, suggestion,
proposal, image or other communication which is obscene or indecent, knowing that the recipient
of the communication is under 18 years of age, regardless of whether the maker of such
communication placed the call or initiated the communication... [or uses an] interactive computer
service to send to a specific person or persons under the age of 18 years of age, or uses any
interactive computer service to display in a manner available to a person under age 18, any
comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication that, in context, depicts
or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardless of whether the user or such service placed the
call or initiated the communication.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

<p>A three-judge panel in Pennsylvania and another three-judge panel in New York have issued a
preliminary injunction against enforcing the CDA on the precept that the statute is
unconstitutionally overbroad, and two judges have ruled the CDA to be unconstitutionally vague
as well.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>  "The CDA is patently a government-imposed content-based restriction on speech.  As
such, it is subject to strict scrutiny and will only be upheld if it is justified by a compelling
government interest and if it is narrowly tailored to effectuate that interest."<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>   Both three-judge
panels found the CDA could not uphold constitutional muster when subject to this strict scrutiny
test.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>  The final determination on whether or not the CDA is constitutional will be heard by the
Supreme Court of the United States.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>   The Communications Decency Act will more than likely
be held unconstitutional by the Supreme court for many reasons.

<p>First, the statute is not narrowly tailored to effectuate the government's interest because the
statute reaches protected speech.  The court in <em>ACLU v. Reno</em> said that the indecency standard set
forth in the CDA may prohibit people from accessing vital information pertaining to subjects
such as AIDS and safe sex and may also prohibit people from accessing prominent literary works
which some communities may consider indecent.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>   The United States already has obscenity
laws in effect, and these laws may be enforced in any mass medium where illegally obscene
material is displayed.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>  Many insist that the existence of these laws is enough to protect our
children from "cybersmut" so long as the laws are enforced.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>   Therefore, the CDA cannot be
narrowly tailored when there are other laws already in effect to address the problem of obscenity
in any media.

<p>Second, the government contends the Internet should be regulated just like television,
newspapers, and radio on the assumption that the Internet is simply another form of mass media. 
However, the panel of judges in ACLU say that the Internet cannot be compared to other forms
of mass media because it is interactive and does not simply appear on one's computer; one must
take affirmative steps to access the information on the Internet.  Therefore, the Internet should be
treated as "'a unique and wholly new medium of worldwide human communication.'"<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> The
panels in <em>ACLU</em> and <em>Shea v. Reno</em> point out that it is highly unlikely that a child will accidentally
come across indecent material by simply "surfing the web." <a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>  Judge Dalzell concludes:  "The
Government may well be right that sexually explicit content is just a few clicks of a mouse away
from the user, but there is an immense legal significance to those few clicks."<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>

<p>Another problem with the CDA is it may cause a chilling effect on an individual's speech.  The
Internet medium allows the average person as well as media moguls to exercise the power of free
speech <a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> and express his or her views on any subject ranging from Princess Dianna to prison
rape.  The average American would more than likely choose not to speak rather than risk
incarceration or a heavy fine.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>  The right to free speech is one of the most highly regarded
constitutional rights, and when that right is infringed upon through a statute drafted by the United
States Congress, the statute should be struck down by the judiciary, as it preliminarily has been
here.

<p>Yet another constitutional hurdle the CDA may not be able to jump is the accusation that the act
is not only overbroad, but also unconstitutionally vague.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>   The terms "indecent" and
"community standards" have been indicated by the plaintiffs in both cases as being vague,
meaning the act could cause a chilling effect on speech because one is not certain as to what the
terms mean.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>  The term "indecent" may have a completely different meaning in New York City
as compared to the definition of the same word in Tyler, Texas.  Which community is
responsible for determining what material transmitted through this world-wide medium is
acceptable (or unacceptable) for all of America?  No one can answer that question, and this is
why two judges have decided the CDA is unconstitutionally vague as well as overbroad.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>   

<p>The CDA will also encounter problems when and if the time comes to enforce the law.  For
example, the carriers of the information, such as CompuServe and America OnLine would not be
held liable for information and images that travel through their services.  This means the
individual transmitting the information must be arrested for sending indecent material through
the Internet.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>  This causes a problem because people may send this information anonymously,
and the sender's identity may not be readily accessible.  Another problem with enforcing the
Communications Indecency Act is many pornographic and indecent material is transmitted to
computers in America from all over the world.  American laws may not be enforceable in foreign
countries; therefore, even if the CDA is found not to violate the constitution, there will be no
guarantee that the CDA will prevent indecent materials from being filtered into the United States
from foreign countries (unless Internet access providers are made liable for the information they
transmit from other countries).<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>

<p>The government has designated two affirmative defenses a defendant may assert when he or she
is brought up on charges for violating the CDA.  One defense a defendant may assert is that he or
she has taken steps to prevent minors from accessing their indecent material by providing an age
verification system by requiring the user to enter  a credit card or identification number.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>  This
means of preventing minors form accessing indecent materials is not available for all forms of
communication over the Internet.  Realistically, age verification is only  technologically feasible
in one mode of Internet communication, and that is on the World Wide Web.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>  Another
problem this affirmative defense encounters is that age verification systems are very expensive at
this time, and this economic barrier may prevent content providers from being able to
communicate their message altogether.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>  The second affirmative defense available to violators
of the CDA may be asserted if: "content providers...'in good faith,' take 'reasonable, effective,
and appropriate actions under the circumstances,' including any steps 'feasible under available
technology' to prevent minors' access to communications falling withing the scope of the
CDA."<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>  The problem with this defense is there are not many, if any,  technologically, as well
as economically, feasible ways to block indecent material to minors.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>  Therefore, "given the
current state of technology, most adult content providers wishing to engage in constitutionally
protected indecent speech will be unable to avail themselves of these affirmative defenses," and
"because neither of the affirmative defenses set out in <em>s</em>223(e)(5) can, with our current
technology, effectively protect adult content providers wishing to engage in constitutionally
protected indecent communication, we reach the inescapable conclusion that <em>s</em>223(d) will serve
to chill protected speech."<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>  As technology evolves and blocking and age verification systems
become more readily available and economical, the CDA may be an excellent way to protect our
children from indecent speech, but until then, the CDA cannot pass first amendment strict
scrutiny analysis.

<p>Obviously, the Communications Decency Act contains many fatal flaws.  Most likely, the
Supreme Court of the United States will agree with the three-judge panels in <em>ACLU </em>and <em>Shea</em> that
the CDA is unconstitutionally overbroad, and possibly vague as well.  Since at this time, the
CDA cannot be enforced in order to protect our children from indecent material on the Internet,
we must come up with other solutions to the problem.

<p align="center"><A NAME = INDUSTRY>III.  The Industry's Answer: Self and Parental Regulation<strong></strong></A>

<p>Since the CDA has been found to violate the First Amendment (at least temporarily), the
computer industry, concerned parents, and special interest groups must think of other ways to
prevent minors from accessing indecent material over the Internet.  There are several different
ways of preventing minors from accessing offensive content on the Internet.  Some of these
services include computer software blocking devices, Web site ratings systems,  commercial
Internet providers' self-regulation, and adult verification systems.  Since these services are
implemented by private entities and individuals, there will be no first amendment issues because
no state action is involved in regulating the industry.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>  

<p>One way people are keeping their children form accessing inappropriate material over the
Internet is by installing Internet filtering software directly onto their computers.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>  This software
is designed to intercept indecent sites and filter them away from the computer screen.  Several
different filtering software systems are available now, and new products are being produced all
the time.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>  Here are just a few examples of products that are on the market now or soon will be:

<ul>
  <li>Cyber Patrol by Microsystems Software, Inc.: "Cyber Patrol is used to manage Internet
access, limit the total time spent online and block access to Internet sites that you deem
inappropriate."  Some of the features of Cyber Patrol include a list called CyberNOT of
over 9,000 Internet sites which may be deemed harmful to minors, a CyberYES function
that lists sites deemed to be appropriate material for children, a function called Chat
Guard that prevents children from communicating information such as their name,
address, or phone number on-line, support for the various ratings systems available on-line, and a time and budget management program.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a></li>
  <li>Net Nanny by TROVE Investment Corporation: "The Best Way to Protect Your Children
and Free Speech on the Internet:"<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a> Parents may add words to Net Nanny's dictionary
and prevent access to sites that contain these words.  "For example, to keep a child from
giving out a name, address, or phone number on-line, you would put that information in
the dictionary."<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>  Net Nanny producers boast that not only can the software block sites
and phrases on the Internet, but it can also monitor non-Internet commercial on-line
services such as Compuserve, Prodigy, bulletin boards and e-mail.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>   Net Nanny
presents itself as "a foe of both pornography and censorship, and an advocate of parental
control."<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a></li>
  <li>SurfWatch by Spyglass: </li>
</ul>

<p>SurfWatch is client-based software that can easily be installed and used with any WWW
browser.  SurfWatch blocks tens of thousands of explicit sites locally at the user's machine,
without restricting the access rights of other Internet users...Filters are constantly updated using a
combination of pattern-matching technologies and a tracking of known adult-oriented sites. 
Monthly updates provide users the most recent list of blocked sites.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>X-Stop by Michael Bradshaw: X-Stop is one of the newer software filtering products and
is not yet available in stores.  One feature X-Stop boasts about is it works off-line as well
as on-line to prevent children from typing "dirty" words on their word processing systems
as well as on the Internet and on e-mail.  This product also contains a built-in dictionary
comprised of inappropriate words and blocks these words from being used as search tools
on the Internet as well as blocks them form being typed on other computer programs. 
Like the Net Nanny, parents can add words and phrases such as a child's name and
address to X-Stop's dictionary to prevent these from being disseminated over the Internet. 
X-Stop's target market will be parents, school districts and companies that use the
Internet.<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Another attempt to prevent children from accessing indecent material on the Internet is using
content rating systems.  One well-known ratings system is implemented by the Recreational
Software Advisory Council (RSAC).  The RSAC is "an independent, non-profit organization that
empowers the public, especially parents, to make informed decisions about electronic media by
means of an open, objective content advisory system."<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>  The RSAC rates sites (and especially
computer software games) according to five levels over three different forms of content.  The
first level is suitable for all audiences.  The next levels are numbered one through four, one being
the least harmful or indecent, four being the most.  The three forms of content the RSAC
considers when rating a site are  violence, nudity, and language.<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>

<p>One computer program called Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) works with
independent ratings systems so parents can block certain sites that are rated unsuitable for
children.  This system allows parents, school systems, and employers to block certain Internet
access to their children and employees by requiring everyone who logs on to the computer to
provide identification information.  The PICS system will block certain rated sites based on the
identity of the user.  This system allows adults to access certain materials that a child using the
same computer cannot.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>  The main problem with this system, however, is that not many Internet
sites are rated; therefore, children may still be able to access indecent sites that are not yet rated
by an independent rating system.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>

<p>Another safeguard against children accessing indecent materials over the information
superhighway is adult verification systems.  The largest age verification system available is
called Adult Check.<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>  Adult Check provides an identification number to adults who subscribe to
the system, and for almost 600 participating adult sites on the Internet, one must enter a valid
identification number in order to access each site.  Adult Check issues a year-long subscription to
its service for $9.95.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>  One problem with Adult Check is that sites are not required to use this
system to verify the age of its users; therefore, if a site does not use Adult Check or another type
of age verification system,  a child may enter into it and access the images and information.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>

<p>In addition to utilizing the many products available to Internet users to block sites, parents are
recommended to take an active role in their children's computer use.  "The best way to assure
that  your children are having  positive online experiences is to stay in touch with what they are
doing.  One way to do this is to spend time with your children while they're online.  Have them
show you what they do and ask them to teach you how to access the services."<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a>

<p>The above solutions to the problem of children accessing indecent materials over the Internet  are
not perfect or fool-proof, but they are a big first-step to protecting our children.  With technology
advancing at such a  rapid rate, new ways of shielding children from indecency are evolving
every day.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>  With these new advances, there will be no need for a statute like the CDA because
software and computer programs like the above will help protect the child as well as an adult's
constitutional rights to engage in indecent speech.

<p align="center"><A NAME = ANOTHER>IV.  Another Problem: Child Exploitation Over the Internet:</A>

<p align="center">Child Pornography,  Kidnaping and molestation<strong></strong>

<p>Not only are children being exposed to indecent material over the Internet, but they are also being
exploited over the Internet.  Child pornography is very prevalent on the Information
Superhighway<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>, and pedophiles are using the Internet to locate their victims.<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>   "'The
utilization of on-line services or bulletin board systems is rapidly becoming one of the most
prevalent techniques for individuals to share pornographic pictures of minors, as well as to
identify and recruit children,' the FBI said."<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>   

<p>Recently, the FBI arrested several people in many different U.S. cities in connection with an on-line child pornography ring.  The FBI conducted raids on more than 120 homes in 57 of the
United States' 94 federal judicial districts.<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>  The investigation began over three years ago, and
more arrests are expected to be made.  The FBI used paper trail techniques, telephone line
linkages, and new techniques specially designed to accost computer criminals in their
investigation.  Many of the pedophiles that were arrested logged on anonymously, but the FBI
was still able to identify them after extensive investigation.<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a>   Federal penalties for participating
in the distribution of child pornography includes up to 10 years in prison and /or a $10,000
fine.<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a>

<p>Another case involving on-line child pornography involves charges not only for distributing child
pornography, but also for child molestation.  In an indictment handed up in central California, "a
Federal grand jury charged 16 people in the United States and abroad with joining in a
pornography ring that was effectively an on-line pedophilia club (called the Orchid Club).  Its
members shared homemade pictures, recounted their sexual experiences with children and even
chatted electronically as two of the men molested a 10-year-old girl."<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>  All of the defendants
were charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute child pornography.  Six of the 16 were
charged with joining or abetting in the sexual exploitation of children.<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a>  The pedophilia club
was first exposed when a six-year-old girl reported to her parents that a friend's father had
sexually abused her at a slumber party.  At least eight children were molested in connection with
the child pornography club.<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>

<p>Obviously, on-line child pornography has become a tremendous problem in the recent years. 
There are several factors that help child pornographers get away with conducting this very illegal
act of distributing kiddie porn over the Internet.<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>  First, computer technology is very easily
accessible and is becoming increasingly less expensive.  Second, purveyors of child pornography
can assume any identity and route an image through several different carriers in several different
locations to make it extremely difficult to detect the origination of the message.  Another
problem is that different countries have different laws about child pornography and the legal age
of consent.  This means that  what is illegal in the United States may be legal in another country. 
One last problem is that it is not mandatory to report incidents of kiddie porn on the Internet. 
Law-makers are struggling with the problem of child pornography transmitted through the
Internet, and, unfortunately, a solution does not seem to be readily available.  "'The problem is
urgent. There are 5,000 web sites this week for child pornography and there will be many more
next month and next year.  The pedophiles have had a head start on us and we must hurry to
catch up.'"<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>

<p>Another problem which involves the issue of child pornography on the Internet is pedophiles are
now creating pseudo child pornography and displaying it on the Internet, which is not in the
scope of current laws.  Pedophiles are now superimposing children's faces on adults' bodies to
make the image appear to be a child engaging in sexual acts.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>  This, Senator Orrin Hatch says,
is just as detrimental as actual kiddie porn because it can still be used to degrade children and
break down their inhibitions.  Therefore, pseudo child porn on the Internet is yet another issue
that needs to be dealt with soon by the United States Congress.<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a>

<p>Another pressing and disturbing issue that law-makers must deal with immediately is pedophiles
targeting their victims over the Internet.<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>  "Instances of children being talked into personal
encounters after computer on-line contacts had been rare until recently, when at least five such
cases were documented around the nation."<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>  For example, Daniel Montgomery in Maple
Valley, Washington ran away from home at the suggestion of a man named Damien who he met
over the Internet.  Daniel's parents typed messages to  him through his e-mail address only to
receive messages from Damien claiming their son was no longer a virgin.  Luckily, Daniel was
found in a San Francisco Airport terminal, seemingly unharmed.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>  Unfortunately, there are
other cases which exist that have not had such a miraculous ending.  In Kentucky, 13-year-old
Tara Noble has allegedly been lured away from her home by a man named George who she met
by way of e-mail.<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a><strong>     </strong>Also, the FBI recently arrested four people for traveling across state lines
intending to have sex with undercover agents posing as minors who had been recruited through
the Internet.<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a>  

<p>Parental involvement is crucial to  deterring the problem of children making personal contact
with virtual strangers that they meet online.<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>  Parents should always be acquainted with their
children's on-line "friends," just like they are acquainted with their children's school friends.<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a> 
Parents should set strict rules forbidding their children from communicating such information
over the information superhighway as their true name, address, or telephone number, and a
parent should never allow his children to meet with someone they encountered on-line, especially
without parental accompaniment.<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a>

<p align="center"><A NAME = CONCLUSION>V.  Conclusion<strong></strong></A>

<p>Although the Internet is an extremely important education tool and a wonderful media for
entertainment, there are obviously dangers waiting for children when they log onto the
Information Superhighway , including exposure to indecent material, child pornography, and
child molesters.  The United States Congress is struggling with these issues on a daily basis, as
are parents, teachers,  special interest groups, and the computer and telecommunications
industries. As we learn more about the Information Superhighway and technology progresses, we
will better be able to confront and conquer the disturbing issues that present dangers to children. 
Until then, we all need to work together in protecting our children from accessing inappropriate
information and communication over the Internet.

<p>Introducing a computer virus into one's computer system is every person's worst nightmare. 
However, to a business, it is lethal.  The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how the modern
computer virus poses problems for parties attempting to apply traditional law.  Also, this paper is
meant to be a blueprint to show the various options an aggrieved user will take.

<p>As business grows so does the need for Internet access.  To a growing business, the information
superhighway promises a chance to tap unexplored markets, contact new customers, and
advertise to the whole world.  When an Internet service failure occurs, a new computer system
can be destroyed.  A customer who is ruined by a computer virus or some other service failure
will not stand idly by while her or his dream goes down in flames.

<p>Most members of the legal profession will agree that, in general, transactions between Internet
access providers and businesses are governed by the U.C.C. and the general principles of contract
law.  However, these cases are limited to situations where a contract has been formed.  For
example, a service provider is liable for expectation, incidental, and consequential damages in a
breach of contract action when the contract promises uninterrupted Internet access and that
access is not provided<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.   Furthermore, courts will usually only allow an action under strict
liability when there is property damage or personal injury.  An example of this kind of case
involves a malfunctioning computer-activated burglar alarm which allowed the homeowner to be
murdered by a robber<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.  Such clear-cut cases are rare.   

<p>However, these rules do not cover all situations.  What causes of action are available to a
plaintiff in the following situations?  In these situations, let us assume that the plaintiff is a
person of average knowledge about information technology.  Average knowledge, for purposes
of this scenario, means that the client knows how to use Windows 95, a word processor, a
spreadsheet, and even some of the Internet navigators on the market.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Hypothetical situation #1</u>: Consulting company D is hired by Business P to automate P's
business.  D promises P several things in its contract.  Company D installs the usual word
processing, database, and spreadsheet packages as well as the software from an Internet service
provider, such as America Online or CompuServe.  Among the things in the contract, D promises
the following:  

<p>(1)  Access to the Internet;

<p>(2)  Automation of the office, which will improve efficiency in the acquisition, compilation and
use of valuable information; and

<p>(3)  The system will be enabled to grow and upgrade with changes in technology.

<p>An employee of Business P pulls a program off the Internet from a website.  This program carries
a polymorphic computer virus, such as "Satan Bug."  The virus, which can hide from most
detection and anti-virus programs, destroys all the information in P's system.  As a result, the
system is rendered useless.  All of P's client information, product information, and order
information is lost.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Hypothetical situation #2</u>:  Consulting company D automates P's system.  D includes plenty of
upgrade program disks and CD's.  These disks and CD's are versions of popular programs from
well-known companies such as Microsoft and Novell.  One of P's employees uses the program
disks to upgrade the system.  This particular copy contains a virus.  The virus destroys P's system
and all its information.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><A NAME="Tech2"><strong>II.  Who is to blame?</strong></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Who is the tortfeasor in both these cases?  This question is difficult to answer because there are
numerous possible tortfeasors.  Among them are the consulting company, the Internet service
provider, the owner of the web page, the owner of the infected program, and the creator of the
virus.  With the exception of the virus creator, it is hard for a potential plaintiff to prove that the
party is the cause-in-fact of the damages.

<p>The creator of the virus is the obvious tortfeasor in this situation.  His tort is an intentional one,
and he is subject to strict liability.  Unfortunately, it is likely that his or her identity will never be
known.  Furthermore, this tortfeasor is, in all likelihood, not a "deep-pockets" candidate.  Many
times, these culprits are teenaged computer hackers who are looking for mischief.

<p>Another potential tortfeasor is the creator of the original program.  Obviously, this party has deep
pockets and can afford to pay a judgment.  In the first hypothetical situation, the plaintiff would
argue that the company had a duty to make sure that its software was safe in all forms on the
Internet.  In the case of the infected backup disks, the software manufacturer is an easy target.  In
the first hypothetical case, establishing a link between the software maker and the virus is much
more difficult because the program has been on the Internet and could have been handled by
hundreds of other users before finally being copied by the employee. 

<p>In the first case, the software maker would argue that it did not create the software with the virus
on it.  Rather, the program became infected with the virus after it was purchased.  The software
maker would also argue that it is not responsible for bootleg copies of its programs.  Finally, the
program manufacturer would argue that it is unwise, as a public policy measure, to force liability
on a software manufacturer when there are possibly millions of copies of its software on the
Internet.  

<p>The service provider arises as a likely tortfeasor in the first hypothetical situation.  This is
because the service provider makes a profit from selling access to the Internet.  There is also the
possibility that the Internet provider furnished the disk space for the website which contained the
virus.  Therefore, the Internet is, inarguably, the product of the service provider.  A plaintiff
might argue that the provider had a duty to warn the customer of the potential dangers of the
Internet.  The plaintiff's attorneys might also state that the provider had a duty to at least provide
some sort of virus detection or anti-virus programs with its software.  After all, the provider is in
the best position to know of the dangers of internet access.   

<p>To counter any attack, the service provider will argue that it did not invent the Internet and, the
Internet is not its product.  On the contrary, it is a mere common carrier like many telephone
companies.  The Internet was already in place before the provider came into existence.  The
service provider will also show that the Internet is a vast, disorganized array of connections and,
consequently, it is impossible to know about every dangerous website.  Any reasonable user
would be aware of the need to check for computer viruses.  In addition, it is impossible for an
Internet provider to provide anti-virus or virus detection system for every virus out on the
Internet; new viruses are invented every year.  In the first case, the virus was especially designed
to avoid such virus detection software.  Consequently, it is bad public policy to force the service
companies to be responsible for every insecure site on the Internet.

<p>Suppose the employee of Business P obtained the faulty program from someone else's web page. 
Many web pages offer free downloads of pictures, images, programs, and other textual materials. 
The owner of that web page could conceivably be at risk for such liability.  Whether or not the
web page owner is a deep pockets tortfeasor depends on the owner.  Common sense indicates
that a web page owner is in an ideal position to know whether or not the programs on his or her
web page are virus-free.  Because the page owner did not receive cash in exchange for this
service, there seems to be a lack of contractual relationship.  On the contrary, this program could
be considered a gift.  An additional problem arises when the page owner claims that she or he got
the program from another web page.  Page owners could implead each other in what could be
endless chains of users.    

<p>Finally, the consulting company is the primary target for litigation.  It has the requisite privity of
contract with the plaintiff that is required to sustain breach of warranty actions.  The consulting
company is also familiar with the end-users.  Thus, the consulting company would know if the
employees of Business P are cognizant of the risks of surfing the Internet.  They might be
charged with the duty to warn of the dangers of viruses and the duty to install the virus detection
and cleaning programs.  

<p>Again, the consulting company would refer to the vastness of the Internet and the impossibility of
knowing everything that is out there. To avoid products liability actions, the consulting company
might state that the employee was not using the Internet for the reason that the system had been
installed.  It could also argue that any reasonable computer user would realize the necessity to
check anything it downloaded for viruses.  If all else fails, the consulting company will blame the
service provider, the web page owner, or the virus maker as the true cause-in-fact of the damage.  


<p align="center"><strong><A NAME="Tech3">III.  In what state does personal jurisdiction lie?</strong></A>

<p>Once a tortfeasor is chosen, the plaintiff's next concern is jurisdiction.  With the exception of the
service provider, imposing jurisdiction on any of the tortfeasors is not a problem.  Of course, the
textbook law of personal jurisdiction applies in this case.  To exercise general personal
jurisdiction over the defendant, the defendant must have a requisite number of minimum contacts
with the forum state such that the exercise of personal jurisdiction does not offend traditional
notions of fair play and substantial justice<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.  The defendant's conduct and connections with the
forum state must be such that the defendant should reasonably expect to be hailed into the courts
of the forum state<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.  Moreover, a court will have jurisdiction if the defendant has purposefully
availed himself of the privileges of the forum state<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.

<p>When a person logs on to a computer, subscribes to a service, or transacts business over the
Internet, does he subject himself to the personal jurisdiction of the forum state?  A case titled
<em>Compuserve, Inc. v. Patterson<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a></em> deals with this issue at some length.  Compuserve is an Ohio-based company.  On the contrary, Patterson was a Texas resident.  Patterson developed shareware
computer software and entered into an ongoing contract with Compuserve to distribute it.  When
a dispute over one of these products arose, Compuserve sued Patterson.  An Ohio trial court
dismissed its claim for want of personal jurisdiction.

<p>The court in the Compuserve case noted that merely entering into a contract with a computer
network service would not, without more, establish that a nonresident subscriber had minimum
contacts with the service's home state for the purpose exercising in personam jurisdiction<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>. 
Next, the court looked at the quality of Patterson's contacts.  The court held that Patterson had
purposefully availed himself of the benefits of doing business in the state by entering into written
agreements and repeatedly sending software to Compuserve.  As a result, Patterson could be sued
in an Ohio court.

<p>The <em>Compuserve</em> case is the opposite of the first hypothetical case because, unlike the first
hypothetical situation, the service provider is the plaintiff.  This brings up an interesting question. 
Does a service provider, by selling its service in a state, submit itself to the personal jurisdiction
of that state?  Because the service provider repeatedly solicits and conducts business in every
state, it seems that the provider's minimum contacts are of the requisite quality where the
provider would have notice that it may be hailed into the forum state's courts.     

<p>   

<A NAME="Tech4"><p align="center"><strong>IV.  What is the cause of action?</a></strong>


<A NAME="Tech5"><p align="center"><u>A.</u>  <u>The</u> <u>General</u> <u>Rule</u></a>

<p>Is the cause of action in either of these situations strict liability, breach of contract, negligence, or
some other type of action?  First, a look at the damages suffered by Business P is necessary.  A
second question encompasses asking how knowledgeable the plaintiff is about technology and
how reliant the plaintiff was on the service provider.  Finally, the courts will analyze the public
policy concerns that will be affected.

<p>The battle over the threshold determination of breach of warranty versus strict liability tort is
critical.  The victor receives either a greater recovery for himself or a decreased recovery for his
opponent.  The plaintiff in these cases always wants to fit his or her cause of action under strict
liability tort because he or she can recover a greater variety of damages thereby. This means that
pain and suffering, past and future mental anguish, and future loss of earning capacity are all
available to the plaintiff who can fit her or his case under tort law.  A defendant, of course, wants
to limit the plaintiff's cause of action to a breach of warranty, thus limiting the plaintiff's
potential recovery to contract damages and expectation damages.

<p>On some occasions, a court will award punitive damages in a breach of contract claim.  Although
punitive damages do not have to be specifically alleged, the plaintiff's complaint must allege
elements of malice, wantonness, or recklessness in order for him to receive punitive damages<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>.  
An example of such an action is <em>Werner, Zaroff, Slotnik, Stern &amp; Askenazy v. Lewis<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>.</em>  In this
case, the defendant computer consultant upgraded the plaintiff's insurance computer system.  The
defendant programmed the software so that the system would shut down at claim number 56789. 
The defendant had apparently done this so that the plaintiff would have to hire him for more
repair work.  The court stated that punitive damages may be awarded in a breach of contract
claim "when to do so would deter morally culpable conduct<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>."

<p>In rare instances, a plaintiff can bring an action in negligence.  The ability to support a negligence
action through a breach of contract action deals with the issue of misfeasance versus
nonfeasance.  In other words, is there an improper performance of a contractual obligation or is
there a simple non-performance of a contractual obligation?<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> 

<p>There are limited circumstances where the plaintiff can maintain both negligence and breach of
contract actions against the consulting company and the service provider.  The theory for this
basis of recovery is stated as follows:

<p>"For example, a relatively unsophisticated plaintiff who relies upon a systems integrator to select
and evaluate software and hardware for a specific purpose might be able to show a special
relationship, supporting negligence as well as warranty-based theories if a system component
selected fails.  Also the use of a system designed to handle especially sensitive data, perhaps data
involving medical diagnosis, could show a special relationship.  In evaluating the existence of a
special relationship, not only the relative unsophistication of the plaintiff and dependence by the
plaintiff on the defendant's expertise is necessary, but also a holding out by the defendant of
special expertise.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>"

<p>The key case covering this tension between products liability and breach of warranty is <em>East
River Steamship Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval</em>.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  This case discusses the three approaches to
handling the problem of harmful products. The first approach is the <em>Seely</em><a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> approach, which
states that the law of warranty applies if the defect in the product causes only monetary damages. 
Only in the case that the product's defect causes personal injury or physical property damage may
strict liability be applied.  Another approach is the one used in <em>Santor v. A&amp;M Karagheusian,
Inc</em><a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>,  which states that strict products liability will be applied even if the plaintiff suffers only
economic damages due to the defect.  The third and final method is the method used in<em>
Pennsylvania Glass &amp; Sand Corp. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co</em><a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>, under which the court would
look at the type of risk created by the defective product.  Afterwards, the court would choose
strict liability or warranty law based upon the characteristics of the risk of that defect.  The court
in <em>East River Steamship Corp</em>. found that the <em>Seely </em>approach was best.

<A NAME="Tech6"><p align="center"><u>B.</u>  <u>Damages</u><br></a>
Damage to a computer system from a virus takes on the elements of both property damage and of
contract damages.  A virus goes into the entire computer system and destroys it.  The computer
system is still physically standing, but it does not function anymore.  The product is not
merchantable and, at the same time, the consumer's property has been altered in a way that
makes it useless.  This makes it very difficult for a court to determine when the <em>Seely</em> approach is
applicable.  

<p>In both hypothetical situations, the plaintiff suffers a complete loss of his system and, possibly,
lost business.  P's attorneys will argue that P suffered both specific damages as well as property
damage and professional reputation damages.  They argue that the physical integrity of P's hard
drives was completely altered.  Although none of the hardware was physically destroyed, the
disks themselves were changed in a way that renders them useless. Thus, physical property
damage has occurred.  

<p>Some courts have applied an "economic loss" rule to damaged computer memory situations.  The
economic loss doctrine bars recovery under the tort theories of negligence or strict liability for
economic transactions, except those involving personal injury or damage to other property<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>. 
One example of a court's strict application of the economic loss doctrine is a case from
Minnesota called <em>Transport Corporation of America, Inc. v. International Business Machines<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>.</em> 
In this case, IBM manufactured a disk drive and some other computer hardware.  It sold these to
I.C.C., a computer consulting firm.  I.C.C. helped the Transport Corporation of America (T.C.A.)
automate its system, but one of the disk drives was faulty and caused the computer system to go
down.  T.C.A. was forced to re-enter data that had been lost between the last time the system had
been backed up and the time the system had failed.  

<p>The court, in the <em>T.C.A.</em> case, agreed that the transaction was not a commercial transaction as
stated under the Minnesota version of the U.C.C.  However it did find that the economic loss rule
still applied.  The court quoted a Minnesota case titled <em>Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts v.
Parker-Klein Assocs. Architects, Inc</em>., which stated, "where a defect in a component part
damaged the product into which that component was incorporated, economic losses to the
product as a whole were not losses to 'other property'<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>."  From that case the court also read,
"tort claims are allowed only in limited situations where the nature of the defect or damage is
other than that which could ordinarily be contemplated by the parties to a commercial
transaction<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>."  From that case, the court concluded that the damage to the computer system was
not "other property" as contemplated by Minnesota common law.  The court also stated that
failure of the disk drive was contemplated by the parties and that the damage was limited in
scope to the computer system.  The court noted that T.C.A. had backed up their disk drives every
night at 2:00 a.m. as evidence of its contemplation of disk drive failure.  At the end of the case,
the court found that T.C.A. must look exclusively to the U.C.C. for its remedy.  At conclusion of
the case, no tort actions were available.  

<p>The Eighth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals has agreed with the T.C.A. rationale
regarding data lost due to service failures.  In <em>Rockport Pharmacy, Inc., v. Digital Simplistics,
Inc.</em>, the Eighth Circuit applied T.C.A. to a Missouri case<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>.  Digital installed a computer system
to maintain pharmaceutical records, screen for drug interaction problems, label prescriptions, and
process insurance claims.  The computer system developed bugs which could not be fixed. 
Rockport terminated the maintenance agreement and refused to accept further software upgrades. 
Rockport also sued under breach of contract, negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation, warranty
for a particular purpose, and breach of implied warranty of merchantability.  

<p>In this case, Rockport argued that the economic loss doctrine did not present a bar to its
negligence claim because the evidence presented at trial showed damage to property other than
the property sold.  This "other" property damage existed in the form of the loss of data installed
in the computer system.  The court, however, concluded that the losses represented nothing more
than "commercial loss for inadequate value and consequent loss of profits.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>"  In a footnote, the
court also rejected Rockport's argument that a "computer crash" involving the loss of data could
be considered a violent occurrence.  It further stated that the term "computer crash" should not be
given a literal meaning<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>.  Thus the court held that Rockport had not sustained damages to
"other" property.  Since Rockport's losses were deemed to be economic losses, it could not
recover under tort theories.  

<p>Rockport also tried to argue that the economic loss doctrine does not apply in an action based on
the "negligent rendition of services by a professional."  The court noted that Rockport had not
alleged in its petition that Digital had violated any professional duty.  The <em>Rockport</em> Court also
noted that this transaction was more for goods than for services.  Afterward, the court stated that
the economic loss doctrine still applied.  

<p>These cases differ from the present hypothetical situations in some respects.  In the hypothetical
situations, the system was destroyed.  Although disk drive failures might be contemplated, the
total destruction of the computer system by a virus might not be contemplated.  A complete loss
of the computer system entails a loss of business and, perhaps, bankruptcy for the plaintiff.  In
the <em>T.C.A</em>. case, the plaintiff lost a day's worth of information.  The hypothetical situations
suggest that Business P lost everything.    


<A NAME="Tech7"><p align="center"><u>C.</u>  <u>Application</u> <u>of</u> <u>Rules</u> <u>to</u> <u>the Hypothetical</u> <u>Situations</u></a>

<p>Under breach of warranty law, the plaintiff will read the plain language of the agreement.  The
contract promised that Business P would have access to the Internet. It also promised P that it
would be better able to manage its information.  Because the system crashed, Business P's access
to the Internet is halted, and P cannot achieve the efficiency that it hired Consulting Company D
to help it achieve.  

<p>Furthermore, attorneys for P will argue that D breached the warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose.  This argument will be most convincing in the second
hypothetical situation.  After all, a computer program that satisfies these warranties must not
have a virus on it.  

<p>There also seems to be a negligence element in the second hypothetical.  For a vendor to sell a
program without checking it for viruses constitutes negligence.  A program was provided, but it
destroyed the system.  Therefore, misfeasance, as opposed to nonfeasance, has occurred. 
Business P wants to allege in its pleadings, pursuant to the <em>Rockport case</em>, that Consulting
Company D was a professional.  If D is deemed a professional, the court should place a greater
duty of care on D than it would an ordinary person.  P also alleges that D rendered its services
negligently.  P will need to find something beyond a maintenance agreement to show that D
negligently performed its services<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>.  Perhaps P would claim that D's training of P's employees
was negligent in that it did not provide any virus protection procedures.     

<p>The circumstances in the first hypothetical case are more difficult.  The system, when installed,
worked properly; it did not have the viruses on it.  Rather, it was the employee who damaged the
system.  In the first case, it seems that the product was merchantable unless one assumes that the
computer system was not merely the vendor's product.  On the other side, it could be assumed
that the Internet was the vendor's product.  

<p>Was the system fit for its particular purpose?  Business P could argue that a system that is fit for
its particular purpose is one that has virus detection and anti-virus programs.  According to Henry
H. Perrit, evidence of custom in the trade is used to determine the contractual duties<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>.  If the
industry custom is for companies like Business P to download software constantly, it seems that
the system is not fit for its purpose.    

<p>The law of products liability will apply in the same way that it does in cases that do not involve
technology. The plaintiff alleges that some manufacturing defect, marketing defect, or design
defect caused injury.  The plaintiff will say that the product was either used properly or
improperly in a foreseeable way.  The defendant will counter with the argument that the injury
was caused by the unforeseeable misuse of the product.  In the second situation, the upgrade
disks were clearly defective, which could be due either to a manufacturing defect or a design
defect.  The employee did not misuse them; he simply tried to upgrade his system.  

<p>The first situation is a bit trickier.  The plaintiff will most likely state that there is a marketing
defect with the system.  He or she will say that Consulting Company D should have included
warnings about the dangers of downloading software and a listing of procedures for doing so
safely.  The plaintiff will further allege that there lack of virus detection programs and anti-virus
programs was a manufacturing or design defect.  

<p>If the employee in hypothetical #1 was using the Internet for personal reasons during a period of
downtime, the defendant's attorneys will argue three things.  First, it will state that there was
nothing wrong with the system; the virus was the product of some intentional tort of an unknown
third party.  Second, the employee was not using the system for its particular business purpose. 
This gives rise to an unforeseeable misuse claim.  Third, it was the employee's negligence which
caused introduction of the virus to the system.  Business P will respond that aimlessly surfing the
web is not misuse.  Even if it is misuse, it is easily foreseeable misuse.  

<p>If Business P had been a completely manual, non-technical firm, it is likely that the plaintiff
would pursue actions in negligence and breach of warranty.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>  Where the client is not astute in
technical matters and the client is heavily reliant upon the consulting company's expertise, the
law will permit recovery under both tort and contract law.  However, in this case, the plaintiff did
have some knowledge of computers.  Does this necessarily mean that the plaintiff is astute in
computers and not reliant on the defendant?  The mere fact that a plaintiff knows how to use
basic applications does not confer the technical knowledge of ftp, gopher, the world wide web,
the Internet, and virus protection.  No court has addressed the issue of what constitutes adequate
computer knowledge.  Furthermore, every business is reliant on its consultants to some extent
once it has undertaken a technology project.  The courts have also not defined the meaning of
"reliance" in these cases.  

<p>These approaches are logical when applied to the situation of a service failure.  On the contrary,
they do not help much when there is no contractual relationship between the aggrieved Internet
user and the source of the virus-infected program. The two hypothetical situations can also not be
truly considered service failures.  That is because a computer virus is some external source which
corrupts the system as opposed to an internal part of the information system that went bad.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<A NAME="Tech8"><p align="center"><strong>V.  Property Law: A Different Approach</strong></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As strange as it sounds, property law could be applied to the first hypothetical situation.  The
world of computers has always been a land of similes and metaphors.  When discussing the
Internet, people often refer to things in terms of places and locations rather than simple sections
of space on some disk on a distant computer.  For example, users join "chat rooms" to talk with
other users.  People have e-mail addresses and web sites.  They "surf the net."  They also refer to
their web pages as if they are places.  

<p>This is a brief review of the property and tort principles that will be involved.  A business invitee
is a person who enters the premises of another in answer to an express or implied invitation of
the owner or occupant on the business of the owner or occupant or for their mutual advantage<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>. 
This invitation can be express or implied.  The landowner or occupier of the land owes the
business invitee the highest duty to inspect the premises and warn of any dangers upon the
land<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>.  There is also some limited case law that holds that an owner or occupant in charge of a
premises must use ordinary care to protect his invitees from the wrongful or negligent acts of
third persons which he has reasonable cause to anticipate<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>.  On the other hand, a licensee is
only a social guest.  If the invitation is purely for the benefit, convenience, or pleasure of the one
invited, he is a licensee<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>.  An owner or occupier of land owes a licensee or a trespasser only the
duty to refrain from harming him with wilful or wanton negligence<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>.  The landholder need only
warn of dangers upon the land of which the landowner knows or has reason to know exist and the
licensee does not. 

<p>This is the way the property law analysis works.  There are two choices of what can be
considered the land.  First, the entire Internet could conceivably be considered the "premises." 
The service provider or the consulting company which gave access to all of Cyberspace could be
considered the landowner.  It would be impossible for the service provider or the consulting
company to inspect the entire Internet to make sure it is safe.  Consequently, a second approach is
more suitable.  The second option is to consider the web-page, ftp site, or gopher site as the
"premises." The landowner, under this option, would be the web-page owner.

<p>The aggrieved visitor will be considered a guest on the "landowner's" land.  Like tort and
property law, we will classify the users as invitees, licensees, or trespassers.  The mere fact that
the site-owner has a page and holds it out for public viewing is considered an invitation.  If the
web-page owner receives some pecuniary gain, such as added business or advertisement, from
the visitor's use of the web-site or ftp-site, the visitor will be considered a business invitee.  As a
result, the page owner will have the duty to inspect his page periodically for viruses and warn of
them at the start of the page.  If the page owner simply has the page for personal reasons, she or
he has only the duty to warn of viruses on the page of which he or she knows and the guest does
not.  

<p>This property law analysis might help to clear up some liability issues.  The employee who is
using the Internet for business purposes and contacts another business's web-page is protected
from the risk of downloading a virus.  This is because the other business most likely has some
pecuniary gain in having the web-site.  The invitee status placed on visitors to that site causes the
home-page business to constantly inspect and revise its web-site.  Likewise, the person who
creates a web-page for the simple fun of it will have a lessened duty.  Only when he or she knows
that some download he or she is offering is corrupted will she have a duty to warn.


<A NAME="Tech9"><p align="center"><strong>VI.  Conclusion</strong></a>


<p>This article has been an illustration of the legal problems that computer viruses can cause. As use
of the Internet increases along with growth in the number of individuals using it, predicaments
like the two hypothetical situations become increasingly likely.  The law will have to adjust to be
able to adequately redress virus-created grievances on the Internet.  The <em>Seely</em> approach does not
present a very clear basis for handling the two hypothetical scenarios.  Furthermore, the property
law analogy is not meant to be a cure-all solution to these kind of problems.  It is only meant to
show that metaphors can be used in technology law to make traditional legal principles fit with
the reality of the Internet.

<p>Meanwhile, consulting companies should do three things.  First, they should include an itemized
listing of disclaimers of warranties.  These disclaimers will state what type of damages are
available in the case of a system failure.  Second, they should state in the contract that they are
not liable for computer viruses downloaded from the Internet.  Finally, consulting companies
should warn their consultants and systems analysts not to exaggerate about the potential of the
systems they create.

<p align="center"><a name="tech1">I. INTRODUCTION</a>

<p>In the last twenty years gaming in the United States has grown exponentially.  In 1976 only two
states had legalized casino gambling, Nevada and New Jersey. Presently all but two states,
Hawaii and Utah, enjoy some type of legalized gaming whether it be casino gambling, video
gambling, river boat casinos, lotteries, bingos, or parimutuel wagering.  The current decade has
hosted such a growth in gaming that in 1994 Americans spent a whopping 482 billion dollars on
all forms of gambling.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  Moreover, American expenditures on gambling has been growing at a
rate of 15% between 1994 and 1995, and 11% between 1995 and 1996.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> A large portion of this
money, 85%, was spent in casinos in 27 states, most of which had been built within the previous
five years.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 

<p>Gaming technology has also shown significant advancement in this modern era.  In the 1980's
companies began to produce video gambling technology for such games as video poker, video
blackjack,  and video slot machines.  Now, there is technology in place for interactive television
gaming which would assist in television interactive wagering. This technology would allow
home viewers to place wagers on sporting events, game shows, beauty pageants, or any other
type of broadcast that would be conducive to betting.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  

<p>This year, four international air carriers have announced intentions to implement in-flight
gambling.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  In fact, airplanes will have seat-back terminals that upon which each passenger may
play during the flight. However, there are some glitches in the air-gaming technology. One, the
technology is not yet very reliable.  One airline has already had to discontinue gaming service
because the airline patrons found broken terminals to be frustrating. Two, flights that originate or
end in the United States prohibit the use of the gambling devices.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  

<p>Not only has gaming expanded on land, on the air, and in the air, it can now be found in space,
Cyberspace that is. Currently, there are over 600 gaming and gaming related sites on the
Internet<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>, some of which come complete with their own banking system and with their own form
of currency.  Therefore, if an American wants to gamble, in many states she may go to a
neighborhood convenience store, a nearby laundromat, a river boat casino, a local bingo hall, a
local racetrack, or any other local gaming site. If she intends to fly while overseas, she may
gamble on the airplane.  Or, if she has a personal computer with access to the Internet, she would
not even have to leave her home; gambling is as close as her fingertips. 

<p>Gaming, in general, concerns citizens and lawmakers alike. It has existed since long before the
soldiers cast lots for Jesus'<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> garments and it will likely continue as long as there are people who
will engage in the practice.  However, sociologists, lawmakers, and other commentators are
greatly concerned about the impact of gaming on communities as well as the sociological impact
on the gamblers and their families.  Congress has recently passed a bill that authorizes a study of
gaming and its economic and social harms or benefits.  This study is to last for eighteen months
and it should help guide lawmakers in making decisions as to whether or not certain forms of
gambling should be implemented in their localities.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>     

<p>Gaming on the Internet would also be an important concern to this committee. Right now,
gaming on the Internet is probably illegal but nearly impossible to regulate due to the off-shore
location of many of the Cyber-casinos, certain encryption technologies that make the gamblers
virtually anonymous and certainly difficult for law enforcement to trace, and antiquated federal
gaming laws that did not anticipate gaming regulation on such a thing as the Internet.  This
session, Congress began rumbling with laws to help regulate some of these problems, however
the session ended before any resolution was made or any law was passed.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>  

<p>Thus, gaming and gaming related sites on the Internet continue to function, virtually without
regulation.  Although the Justice Department has resounded that gaming on the Internet is in fact
illegal, gaming companies and gamblers continue their entanglement in cyberspace.  It may take
the courts and legislatures years to effectively rule upon the current laws governing gaming on
the Internet, or to create new laws that may more effectively tame virtual gambling.  In the mean
time, there is a great deal of potential for profit for the companies that own the Internet casino
sites; some commentators project that Internet casinos could become a ten billion dollar
industry.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  However, there is also a great potential for crimes, such as money laundering and
consumer fraud. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><a name="tech2">II. TYPES OF GAMING SITES THAT CURRENTLY CAN BE FOUND ON THE INTERNET</a>

<p>One commentator estimates that one can find over 600 gaming and gaming related cites over the
Internet.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>  Not all of these cites operate as actual gambling opportunities all by themselves. 
Many merely offer statistical information, advertisements, or simulate games of chance and give
the player strategical advice. However, other gaming sites actually allow a gambler to wager
either with money in a foreign or domestic banking account, with debit or credit cards, or a
converted Internet currency.

<p>One type of gaming-related Internet site is a site which provides betting information only. These
sites usually convey statistics of athletic teams and events and can be used for betting purposes or
for mere information.  These information sites include sports information and statistics<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>, the
names and summaries of books that can aid in wagering<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> track information and racing
schedules for parimutuel wagering<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>, parimutuel distributions<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>, and advertize sportsbooks in
places that have legalized gambling, such as Nevada<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>. 

<p> One gaming site advertises an off-track betting service which would allow a wagerer to place a
bet from anywhere in the world by making a phone call and following betting instructions.  The
site states the purpose of the off-track betting service, 

<p>Capital OTB was created by the New York State Legislature to accept legalized wagering on
horse racing.  The revenue earned is distributed to the State of New York, local governments, and
the horse racing industry.  The phone-a-bet system was designed specifically with the ease and
convenience of wagering, right at your fingertips.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>

<p>Those in the horse racing business hope that such information sites and off-track betting services
will revive the dying industry by encouraging off-track betting and thereby bringing in more
revenue.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>

<p>There are also many lottery related Internet sites.  Some of the more innocuous lottery sites
provide information only, but lots of it. One site, run by USA Today, gives the last week's
winning lotto numbers from all over the United States.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>  Another lottery site not only publishes
the winning numbers but analyzes and averages the winning numbers as well as gives strategical
lottery advice.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>  Other lotto sites invite browsers to join lottery clubs and pools that supposedly
increase members' odds of winning state lotteries.  Although there are information sites which
publish the current winning numbers from the states which have lotteries, there are currently not
lottery sites on the Internet which invite users to purchase lottery tickets from sites located inside
the United States. 

<p>However, there are plenty of opportunities to play lotteries internationally.  One such site invites
browsers to participate in lotteries in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Spain and The United Kingdom,
tempting users to take "Your Chance to Become and Instant Millionaire".<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> 

<p>Another Internet lottery cite, InterKeno, boasts that one "Can Win $1 Million U.S. Every 30
Minutes".<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a> This cite allows a lotto player to register for winning by giving a name, address,
phone number, pin number, and by calling a secured international number in order to give a Visa,
MasterCard, or Eurocard number.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>  The cite also gives the following information on it's home
page: 

<p>Interkeno is operated under license granted by the Government of Gibraltar.  Acting custodians
approved by the Government of Gibraltar are jointly Peter Albert Isola, Notary Public and
Deloitte &amp; Touche, a member of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International.  Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
Gibraltar have been appointed to audit the financial statements of Interkeno limited.  All funds
are deposited with and paid out from the InterKeno account with Barclays Bank, one of the
World's largest banks.  InterKeno will distribute approximately 13% of its gross revenue to The
New world Foundation and other charitable organizations.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>


<p>Another lottery, InterLotto, boasts that it is the first legal international lottery on the   Internet and
that it is authorized and controlled by the Liechtenstein Government, which governs a country of
about 30,000 inhabitants.  InterLotto is also audited by Coopers &amp; Lybrand and accounts are paid
from and deposited with the InterLotto account of the Liechtensteinische Landes Bank AG. 
InterLotto pays 65% of the proceeds from the ticket sales, the other 35% "goes to charitable
causes and to cover running costs"<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>. InterLotto holds a weekly, public drawing in Liechtenstein,
and offers security encryption for credit card numbers that players give over the Internet. 
Winners are paid by international draft. <a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>  Other Internet gaming sites allow the computer
gambler to place bets with international sports books. One Australian site advertises:

<p>National Sports book offers a fixed odds betting service on a range of Australian and
International sporting events.  The fixed odds format ensures that the odds secured when you bet
are the odds your are paid, regardless of any late price fluctuations.  

<p>On the local scene National Sports book bets on events such as the Australian Rules Football,
Test Cricket, major tennis and golf tournaments, the National Basketball League, the National
Soccer League, The Australian Grand Prix and much more.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All major international sporting events are also covered.  If you want to have a bet on the tennis
from Wimbledon, the American National Football League, the US Masters Golf, French Open
Tennis, World Cup Soccer or the National Basketball Association, then the National Sports book
can accommodate you. A wide range of betting options is available on all events....<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>


<p>Minimum bet is $5.00- Maximum bet is by negotiation.  We reserve the right to reduce the size
of a bet.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Another Sports book site will even take bets on Japanese Sumo.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>

<p>WagerNet, also a sports betting site, is a location wherein sports gamblers select the amount and
team upon which they wish to wager and WagerNet matches the gambler with an opposing
gambler who will in turn cover the bet.  WagerNet is located in Belize, and boasts that it will
"provide sports fans with a legal way to bet on sporting events from anywhere in the world... 24
Hours a Day!"<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>  In order to take advantage of this service, a wagerer must pay a $100 setup fee
for hardware and software that is necessary to set up the program on a PC.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>  But, what the ad
doesn't tell the browser is that she must set up a $1000 off-shore account in order to make
international sports bets.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>  It does however warn the user to "consult your local, county, and
state authorities regarding restrictions on off-shore sports betting via telephone before registering
with WagerNet."<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>  

<p>If sports betting is not the browser's vice of choice, bingo is also an available option. 

<p>One can play MegaBingo on the Internet via a computer link to American Indian gaming halls. 
The game is played by proxy whereby the bingo player notifies a proxy player, at least thirty
minutes before the advertised game time, that she wishes to play.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>  The bingo player is charged
$5.50, from a debit account, to play one game with three cards; the three card game costs $5.00
and the proxy fee is $.50.  The proxy player then downloads the orders from the Internet bingo
players and then goes into the bingo hall.  The proxy player records the plays on a notebook
computer and yells BINGO for a winning card to stop the play.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>  The bingo player can win up
to $5,000 for a winning card and an added bonus that if a player covers the whole bingo card in
50 balls or less, the player wins a jackpot.  This jackpot allows the bingo player to travel to the
Creek Nation bingo hall in Tulsa where she will spin the MegaBingo Prize Wheel which
guaranties a minimum $50,000 cash prize, and a maximum of a $1,000,000 annuity.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>  The site
also boasts that the odds of winning at MegaBingo are greater than most state lottery games.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a> 

<p>The last and probably the most controversial type of Internet gaming site is the Internet casino. 
There presently a few different kinds of Internet casinos.  One is simply a site where one can play
computer simulated casino type games such as poker and slot machines by betting points with a
potential to win or loose points only.  Another casino-type gaming site likens itself to glorified
arcade where one can bet "funbucks" which are like arcade tokens, and one can win "funbucks"
which can be cashed in for money.  A user can purchase not less than 1000 "funbucks" for $10,
or write to an address to acquire fifty "funbucks", thus no purchase is necessary in order to
play.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>  Unlike some of the more controversial casino sites, this one is not high-stakes and it
originates in San Jose California.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>The more controversial casinos are located off-shore in countries like Antigua, Belize, and other
remote locations whose countries protect the practice of Internet casino gaming.  There are
several reasons why these casinos are particularly controversial: first, they are relatively
inexpensive to set up, costing only one tenth of the amount that on-land casinos require, and they
are not required to adhere to the strict licensing proceedures like those required of the on-land
casinos located in the U.S. ; second, while the casinos can be paid in U.S. dollars their earnings
are not taxed as heavily as U.S. on-land casinos are taxed;  third, the casinos require either
international bank accounts or credit cards to play  and thus, according to some commentators,
creates the possibility for crimes like consumer fraud and money laundering<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>; and fourth
because the sites are accessible in all fifty states even though this sort of gambling is illegal
nationally, and particularly within certain states<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>.

<p align="center"><a name="tech3">III.  THE LAWS CURRENTLY GOVERNING GAMBLING OVER THE INTERNET</a>

<p>Three statutes were specifically enacted to prohibit organized crime in gambling activities and to
prevent gambling from crossing state lines.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a> The first is the Federal Interstate Wire Act which
states:

<p>Whoever being engaged in the business of betting or wagering knowingly uses a wire
communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers
or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for
the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit
as a result of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both. <a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This statute clearly applies to Internet gaming, however the problem is in its enforcement. The
statute cannot be enforced against the gambler because the legislature did not enact it in order to
protect gamblers from their vices, but to aid law states' enforcement of anti-gambling laws.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a> 
Furthermore, one court held that even a professional gambler who placed substantial weekly
wagers was not "engaged in the business of betting or wagering" and could not be convicted
under the Wire Act for knowingly using wire communication facility for placing bets.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>  

<p>Neither can the statute be enforced against the server or access provider.  The statute has a
regulatory<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a> provision that requires that a common carrier, who is notified by the Federal
Government that gambling activities are taking place over it's facility, must discontinue its
service, and can do so without recourse.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>  However, this section only applies to common
carriers who are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, and currently, the is no
law requiring the Internet or its providers to be licensed by the FCC.<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a> Therefore, the originators
of the gaming sites are really the only entities against whom the Wire Act can be enforced.  This
would be a simpler proposition if the gaming sites were subject to U.S. jurisdiction under the
federal statute; for gaming over wire transmissions would be illegal whether or not the wagerer is
located in a state that sanctions legalized gambling if the wagering process crosses state lines.<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a> 
However, because most of the Internet gaming sites originate off-shore, supported or even in
some cases run by the off- shore government, or by the American Indian Nation, some posit that
the United States lacks jurisdiction to prosecute the gaming sites' coordinators<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>.  There are
cases where the Internet gaming activities are closely entangled with or run by the governments
where they are located. Thus, in the interest of international comity and sovereignty,<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a> it may be
best for the United States to seek other ways to regulate gaming on the Internet than by fining or
imprisoning the sites' operators as the Wire Act proscribes for its violators.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>  

<p>The second federal statute that governs gambling in the United States is the Travel Act which
prohibits interstate and foreign travel or transportation in aid of racketeering enterprises.<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>  This
act provides in pertinent part that:

<p>(a) Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any facility in interstate
or foreign commerce, with intent to--(1)distribute the proceeds of any unlawful activity; or...(3)
otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management,
establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to
perform--(A) an act described in paragraph (1) or (3) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned
not more than 5 years, or both...(b) As used in this section (I) "unlawful activity" means (1) any
business enterprise involving gambling... <a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>

<p> 

<p>Thus, presumably the use of a facility, like the Internet, to gamble or to promote gambling either
interstate or offshore is illegal under the Travel Act.  Therefore, this act is broader than the
Interstate Wire Act.  This act may give the United States jurisdiction to prosecute its citizens who
go off-shore in order to set up Internet Casinos.  These persons are similarly situated with the
persons at whom this act is aimed, "those persons who reside in one state while operating or
managing illegal activities located in another state."<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a> 

<p>However, although at least one case is pending to test this issue <a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a>, the courts have not yet ruled
on jurisdiction as it applies to off-shore Internet casinos and a definitive ruling could be years in
the making.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a> 

<p>The breadth of the Travel Act also makes the mere gambler, participating in off-shore or out-of-state Internet Gaming, a target for prosecution.  In order for law enforcement to detect illegal
gaming activities, it must gain permission from the gaming site or intercept the transmission
through wiretapping.  The gambling site would defeat itself by giving the United States
permission to monitor gamblers and because of international wire-tapping difficulties, 
enforcement of such a crime would be difficult if not impossible, and certainly may not be
economically reasonable.  Furthermore, because of encryption technology and anonymity on the
Internet the efforts of law enforcement may become more time consuming, expensive and
difficult<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>, when it comes down to catching small-time Internet gamblers, than the government
can afford.

<p>The third federal statute at governs gambling on the Internet is The Crime Control Act.<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>  The
act states in pertinent part:

<p>(a) Whoever conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an illegal
gambling business shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. 
(b) As  used in this section-- (1) "illegal gambling business" means a gambling business which
(I) is a violation of the law of  a State or political subdivision in which it is conducted; (ii)
involves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part
of such business;  and (iii) has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period
in excess of thirty days or has a gross revenue or $2,00 in any single day. (2) "gambling" includes
but is not limited to pool-selling, bookmaking, maintaining slot machines, roulette wheels or dice
tables, and conducting lotteries, policy, bolita or numbers games, or selling chances therein. (3) If
five or more persons conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all  or part of a
gambling business and such business operates for two or more successive days, then, for the
purpose of obtaining warrants for arrests, interceptions, and other searches and seizures, probable
cause that the business receives gross revenue in excess of $2,000 in any single day shall be
deemed to have been established.  <a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This statute is applicable to the Internet gambling industry in that gambling sites probably meet
the criteria of "five or more persons"<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>,  as long as the site has been in "substantially continuous
operation for a period in excess of thirty days"<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a>.  Theoretically, under this statute, access
providers could also be considered one of the five or more persons who would be liable under
this statute<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a>. However, one commentator states, "some courts are reluctant to apply such
liability because "[t]he penalties for violating s 1955 are much more severe than the penalties for
violating the predicate state law crimes."<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>  

<p>Even though some courts have held in such a manner, the necessary proof as to whether one
"conducts" a gambling business is whether she performs any "necessary function" in a gambling
operation other than that of a mere bettor.<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a>  Under this requirement, courts have held that such
persons performing "necessary functions" can be janitors<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>, agents, runners, independent
contractors or the like as and only customers of the business are to be excluded<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>.  Therefore, it
is conceivable that access providers can be sued under the Act, and depending on whether courts
are willing to interpret the Act as including them in the five persons conducting a "necessary
function" of the gaming operation, access providers may be held liable for carrying gaming sites
on their services. 

<p>Thus, courts may be divided as to whether they wish to prosecute access providers and
intermediaries under this statute.  A court's decision may be based on whether it wishes to
impose a duty upon the intermediaries to moniter what it disseminates over the Internet and
whether the penalties for mere middle-men are too harsh under the Federal Crime Control Act.     

<p>A more recent federal law which governs American Indian Gaming and applies to MegaBingo as
it is played by proxy on the Internet, is the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a> 

<p>This act exempts American Indian Tribes from Federal law prohibiting the use of the mails,
telephones and television for gaming purposes in running Class II bingo games The senate Indian
Affairs Committee wrote: "It is the Committee's intent that with the passage of this act (IGRA),
no other federal statute... will preclude the use of otherwise legal devices used solely in aid of or
in conjunction with bingo or lotto or other such games on or off Indian lands."<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Furthermore, a letter from the National Indian Gaming Commission confirms that MegaBingo
falls within the definition of Class II gaming.  

<p>There is no statutory prohibition of the use of agents for the conduct of bingo. Accordingly, the
acts of the agent, which occur on Indian lands, are deemed to be the acts of the principal ...
Therefore, in the opinion of the commission, the conduct of the game described herein falls
within the definition of bingo, and within the definition of Indian lands. <a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a>   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Although, in the opinion of the National Indian Gaming Commission, MegaBingo is a legal use
of the Internet, it has not yet been widely advertized or utilized by webbrowsers.<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>  However,
there is a potential for up to 600 proxy players per Bingo game who each have the potential to
win up to $5000 per night of play.<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>  Promoters will begin to more vigorously advertize the
Internet bingo service in the hopes that the trend of Internet bingo will catch on.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a> 

<p>Thus, with the exception of MegaBingo, Internet gambling is illegal and has been declared illegal
by the Justice Department.<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a>  However, there continue to be numerous gaming sites offered on
the Internet.  Presumably, this is owing to jurisdictional discrepancies, to multinational
involvement, and to the operators' belief that they can not be prosecuted, or that they will
operate, in defiance of the law, until they are prosecuted.<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a>  Another difficulty in the
enforcement of the federal laws that should be prohibitive to Internet Gambling is that
enforcement of the statutes is simply not a current priority.<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>  

<p>Some believe that interactive gambling could lead to international organized crime and money
laundering because of the use of international bank accounts, encrypted codes and the ability for
money to move quickly and untraceably through Internet gaming systems.<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>  Others do not
believe that the Internet wagering systems pose enough of a threat to merit a widespread federal
investigation, and furthermore, that State Attorney General's offices could make the business of
Internet gambling intolerable for venturers.<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a>   Thus, there seems to be some disagreement as to
who, state government or federal government, should be responsible to enforce anti-gambling
legislation.  

<p>Minesota's Attorney General's Office has already embarked upon the enforcement of its anti-gambling and consumer fraud legislation upon Internet gambling operators.<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a>  This effort for
enforcement may be enough to scare other gaming sites out of Minesota.  For instance, although
bingo of any form is only illegal in three states, Utah, Hawaii and Arkansas, MegaBingo does not
offer its services to citizens in the state of Minesota.<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a> 

<p align="center"><a name="tech4">IV. THE FUTURE OF GAMING ON THE INTERNET</a>

<p>Minnesota is not the only state that has taken consumer fraud actions against Internet sites,
Illinois and Pennsylvania also argue that notwithstanding federal legislation, they are first in the
line of defense against consumer fraud.<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a>  Many other state attorney generals could join with
these three in enforcing state consumer protection, false advertizing, and anti-gambling laws.

<p>Whether or not the states enforce anti-gaming statutes, Congress has passed the National
Gambling Impact Study Commission Act which requires a two-year study to be conducted by a
neutral Commission.<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a> The Commission will study, in particular, the impact of gaming on
communities, families, and society in general, and whether or not the economic payoff balances
with the social costs of legalized gaming. <a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a>  The Commission will also focus its study upon the
impact of American Indian and Internet gaming.<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a>  Two members of the commission have
already been appointed: James Dobson, a Christian psychologist, and Paul Moore, a Radiologist
from Mississippi.<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a>  Seven other members have been set to be appointed by the President and
the Senate Majority leader, and the Speaker of the House, but as of yet<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a> these appointments
have not been announced.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>  New Jersey, as a gaming state, is lobbying for a spot on the
Commission.<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a>  There are also commentators that express the need for a regulatory voice on the
Commission, such as James Bible, the former chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board.<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a> 
Although the law is uncertain right now about gaming on the Internet, perhaps at the end of this
Commission's study, Congress will be prompted by the results to provide clear legislation to
regulate gaming on the Internet. 

<p>Gambling seems to have been on the minds federal legislators this session. In addition to the
Gambling Impact Study Commission Act, a bill was submitted in both the House and the Senate
in hopes that gambling on the Internet could be outlawed.  This bill however, did not go to a vote
this year while Congress was in session. 

<p>It seems as though few people really trust the rogue Internet gambling entities.  Computer
industry specialists don't want to be associated with the business. Some legislators want to study
computer gaming and other  legislators want to outlaw the whole thing altogether. Attorneys
General want to prosecute gambling sites for consumer fraud. Gambling Organizations resent the
lack of regulation and restriction applied against the computer sites.  And psychological experts
are afraid that  Internet gaming will encourage addiction by making gambling too accessible and
too surreal.  But no one has really been able to effectively control Internet gambling, and it may
not even be a law enforcement priority because there seem to be 'bigger' crimes out there.

<p>However, a true gambler may not be concerned about all of the criticism and may not take
caution.  Rather, she may be excited by the illegality of a gambling venture over the computer. 
Even if some commentators believe that Internet gaming is fairly innocuous and that the public
cannot really be affected by the institution of cyber-casinos, there are gamblers out there who are
already trying to beat the odds.  For example, one gambler states, 

<p>Let's talk about their [The Casino Riviera's] Blackjack game for a moment. This is the best
playing opportunity I've seen since the Alton Belle Casino in Alton, Illinois decided to pay 2 for
1 on all their blackjacks in December, 1994.  Unlike all other online casinos, the Riviera is not
shuffling the deck(s) after every hand.  In their effort to be as realistic as possible, they are
dealing about 75% of the cards in their single deck game before the shuffle. This means that card
counting will work here. Think of it.  You could log onto this game and have another computer
standing by to process the information.  As each card is dealt, you can enter it into your other
computer and it will give you the PERFECT PLAY for the hand. Oh you'll lose some, simply
because a computer cannot predict the next card is a 5 which will fit perfectly with the dealer's
16, but believe me, you'll win most of them.  Pair that with the fact that there is no "camouflage"
needed in your betting (you can jump from a $2 bet to a $25 bet -- a tipoff to "real" casino
supervisors that you're a counter) and it's the best game available anywhere.<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a>  

<p>Individuals who use computer devices to count cards can be legally prosecuted in states like
Nevada which have outlawed card-counting devices.  Furthermore an actual casino can eject a
gambler for counting cards.<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a>  

<p>A physical casino, that is regulated by its state's laws, is regulated by strict standards which
prohibit cheating and organized crime control.  Furthermore, it would be exceedingly difficult for
an physical casino to shut down, to avoid paying a big winner, and to duck law enforcement only
to reopen somewhere else.  Most forms of  Internet gaming are illegal, and with their illegality
and rogue status comes the possibility of fraud.  In order to gamble, the wagerer must set up an
International account or give a credit card number.  The Internet casino will always be paid, but
the question is: will the gambler always be paid?

<p><em>If cyberspace is a type of community, a giant neighborhood made up of networked computer
users around the world, then it seems natural that many elements of a traditional society can be
found taking shape as bits and bytes.  With electronic commerce comes electronic merchants,
plugged-in educators provide networked education, and doctors meet with patients in offices
on-line.  It should come as no surprise that there are also cybercriminals committing
cybercrimes</em>.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 1995, there were approximately fifteen million users of the Internet.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup> Experts estimate that by
1998 there will be over 100 million users of the Internet;<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup> a number equal to the combined
population of the world's six largest cities.<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup> This rapid expansion of the Internet has brought
with it an increase in computer related criminal activity.<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup> However, this burgeoning growth has
not so much lead to new types of crimes or criminals; rather, it has provided a new environment
in which society's lawless fringe can propagate their crimes.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup> In essence, the Internet simply
provides another playing field for criminals to express traditional criminal conduct.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup> In order to
better understand this new criminal frontier and how society has responded, this paper will
examine what makes up the criminal element on the Internet, the types of crimes they undertake,
and how the legal community has responded to regulate that conduct.  Accordingly, these topics
will be addressed in the following order:

<a name="tech2"><p align="center">II. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE "CYBERCRIMINAL"</A>

<p>Just as with other areas of criminal justice, experts on criminal activity on the Internet have
attempted to determine what characteristics are common among would-be "cybercriminals." 
However, unlike other areas of criminal studies, experts on criminal activity on the Internet often
lack advanced levels of education, but are instead former criminals themselves.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup> An intimate
knowledge of cybercrimes has allowed these "experts" to develop a profile of the cybercriminal,
and to provide useful interpretations regarding their motivations, despite the elusive nature of
Internet crimes.  From these experts, the following definitions, analysis and conclusions are
available.

<a name="tech3"><p align="center">A. HACKERS VS. CRACKERS</A>

<p>"Hacker" is a popular term used to describe a person thirsty for knowledge about anothers'
computer systems.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup> The Hacker's Dictionary defines a hacker as "[a] person who enjoys
exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed
to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary."<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup> These individuals employ a
combination of technical wizardry and sheer persistence to satiate their curiosity for
knowledge.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup> The hacker enjoys the challenge of getting inside a system.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup> In a sense, "hacking
is 'an activity a lot like voyeurism -- to know secrets no one else knows.'"<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup> Traditionally,
hackers were teenagers possessed of technical knowledge and time to explore others' computer
systems.<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup> However, in the early 1990s, the growth of the Internet and development of its
applications, coupled with the increase of hackers' ages, led maturing hacker neophytes to begin
their explorations with malicious intent.<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup> These new-age hooligans have been given a new term
that better reflects their malicious intent: the "cracker."<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup>

<p>The difference between the hacker and cracker can perhaps best be understood by the following
passage: "'Trespassing is entering onto someone else's property, and that's what hackers do' . . . .
'Burglary is taking from someone's property, and arson is burning down someone else's property,
[and that's what crackers do].'"<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup> It is the cracker, the most criminal element on the Internet, that
is the focus of the remainder of this essay.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech4"><p align="center">B. PROFILE OF THE CRACKER</A>

<p>A "cracker" is a person who breaks into others' computer systems for the sole purpose of
wreaking mischief or destruction.<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup> Crackers are typically young males, ranging in age from
early teens to late twenties.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup> Frequently described as "fast learners," these individuals often
become bored with school and develop and affinity for computers over schoolwork.<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup> In later
adult life crackers gain employment in computer-related professions assuming, that is, that they
have not been imprisoned for their unlawful activities.<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup> Crackers typically possess a
combination of skills that enable them to break into even the most sophisticated of computer
systems.<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup> Primary among these skills are a technical aptitude for computers coupled with social
skills enabling the cracker to finagle unsuspecting individuals out of information necessary to
break into a system.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup> 

<p>Within the larger genus of crackers, there exists a number of species: disgruntled employees and
former employees, software developers, pranksters, professionals, and digital terrorists.<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup>
Surprisingly, disgruntled employees are one of the most common types of crackers.<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup> Employees
of large corporations frequently access information beyond their security clearance levels or take
advantage of their favored position.<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup> Some disgruntled employees even use their security
clearances to extort and blackmail their employers.<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup>

<p>Software developers are another group that commonly crack computer systems.<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28)</a></sup> in order to stay
on top, or to supposedly "better" the security of the company's system.<sup><a href="#N_29_">(29)</a></sup> Electronic industrial
espionage and sabotage are common tactics used by software developer crackers in order to
ensure the continued superiority of their software.<sup><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a></sup> This allows them to stay one step ahead of
the competition.  Other software developers crack their employer's systems in order to ensure the
systems are secure against violation.<sup><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a></sup> The idea is that if they can find potential weaknesses, the
company can use this information to strengthen the security of their systems.<sup><a href="#N_32_">(32)</a></sup>

<p>Pranksters are typically young, adolescent males who breach computer systems in order to satisfy
their voyeuristic desire to know what others systems contain.<sup><a href="#N_33_">(33)</a></sup> They seek an intellectual
challenge, rather than pecuniary gain or destruction or damaging of others' systems.<sup><a href="#N_34_">(34)</a></sup>
Unfortunately, their successful breaches of computer security oftentimes lead to unintentional
economic or system damage.<sup><a href="#N_35_">(35)</a></sup> Most crackers begin their careers as pranksters before deciding to
pursue more ambitious cracking achievements.<sup><a href="#N_36_">(36)</a></sup>

<p>The two final classifications of crackers are less common, but present the potential for much
greater harm.  Professional crackers are just that: engaged in the profession of cracking
computers for an occupation.<sup><a href="#N_37_">(37)</a></sup> Not unlike mercenaries, these individuals are experts at their
occupation and are seldom detected or caught.<sup><a href="#N_38_">(38)</a></sup> Digital terrorists unlawfully use or threaten to
use violence against computer systems "with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or
governments, often for ideological or political reasons."<sup><a href="#N_39_">(39)</a></sup> To date, no crackers have been
classified as digital terrorists.<sup><a href="#N_40_">(40)</a></sup> Nonetheless, potential weapons of the digital terrorist might
include worms, viruses or physical destruction of computer systems.<sup><a href="#N_41_">(41)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech5"><p align="center">III. "CYBERCRIMES" ON THE 'NET</A>

<p>Computer crimes are, in some ways, nothing more than a logical extension of other types of
modern criminal activity.<sup><a href="#N_42_">(42)</a></sup> "At one extreme, computer crime can be much more profitable than
other forms of larceny or fraud, so it has a clear attraction to financial criminals.  At the other
extreme, computer crimes are often perpetrated as intellectual challenges without any profit
motive at all."<sup><a href="#N_43_">(43)</a></sup> What follows is a brief description of a number of the more prominent forms of
computer crimes along with anecdotes detailing instances of each form of crime.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech6"><p align="center">A. NETWORK BREAK-INS</A>

<p><img src="/cyberspc/img1.gif" width="306" height="223" align="right" >Network break-ins are typically accomplished
by crackers employing software tools installed
on a computer at a distant location.<sup><a href="#N_44_">(44)</a></sup> Having
gained access, the cracker is then able to "steal
data, plant viruses or Trojan horses, or work
mischief of a less serious sort by changing
users names or passwords."<sup><a href="#N_45_">(45)</a></sup> And as more
and more companies seek the benefits of
having a presence on the Internet, "there's an
exponential increase in the information
available for the taking."<sup><a href="#N_46_">(46)</a></sup> 

<p><p><br><BR><BR><img src="/cyberspc/img2.gif" width="296" height="225" align="right" >By and large, the vast majority of computer
break-ins go undetected.  Some experts estimate
that between 85 and 97 percent of intrusions are
never detected.<sup><a href="#N_47_">(47)</a></sup> Adding to the confusion is the
fact that most break-ins go unreported because
companies do not want others to know their
systems may be vulnerable.<sup><a href="#N_48_">(48)</a></sup> As a
consequence, it is difficult to ascertain the
frequency  with  which  such  break-ins occur.

<p>However, a recent survey jointly undertaken by
Ernst and Young and Information Week
magazine found that "fifty-four percent of
companies reported some type of financial loss
over the past two years as a result of computer  problems   -   some   crashes   and 

<p>internal problems, but many of them were the result of malicious damage."<sup><a href="#N_49_">(49)</a></sup> See the related
sidebar story.<sup><a href="#N_50_">(50)</a></sup>

<a name="tech7"><p align="center">B. ESPIONAGE</A>

<p>Corporations and individuals, like
governments, cherish the opportunity to spy
on their enemies.<sup><a href="#N_51_">(51)</a></sup> The  new  electronic 
frontier  provides  new  opportunities  for
these groups to access information heretofore
thought to be inaccessible.<sup><a href="#N_52_">(52)</a></sup> Corporations
employ professional crackers to retrieve
proprietary information ranging from product
development to marketing strategies.<sup><a href="#N_53_">(53)</a></sup>
Individuals  use  the  Internet  to  access 
secret  government  files  and transfer this
information to foreign nations at a high price
to American security.<sup><a href="#N_54_">(54)</a></sup> Intrusion into U<img src="/cyberspc/img3.gif" width="306" height="315" align="right" >.S.
government  computers  is  a  common
occurrence, despite the civilian government
and military's best efforts to ensure security.<sup><a href="#N_55_">(55)</a></sup>
These sophisticated crackers rarely leave
behind any evidence of their intrusion.<sup><a href="#N_56_">(56)</a></sup> As a
result, tracing the criminal is labor-intensive, and convictions   are   rare   because    the    laws 

<p>currently in place were not written with electronic espionage in mind.<sup><a href="#N_57_">(57)</a></sup> See related sidebar
story.<sup><a href="#N_58_">(58)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><a name="tech8">C. SOFTWARE PIRACY</A>

<p>Piracy of software is a relatively easy undertaking, oftentimes requiring little more than
duplicating a manufacturer's product and simply posting it at varying locations on the Internet
and bulletin board systems.<sup><a href="#N_59_">(59)</a></sup> "Pirates" steal software for a variety of reasons ranging from
ignorance of the law to purely profit motives.<sup><a href="#N_60_">(60)</a></sup> Regardless of the motive, software piracy is
detrimental in that it "stifles innovation, destroys the financial incentives for the creation of new
programs and applications, and menaces the continued growth of the [software] industry."<sup><a href="#N_61_">(61)</a></sup>

<p>To protect the software industry from such piracy, U.S. law prohibits the duplication of software
for profit, as well as the unauthorized distribution of software.<sup><a href="#N_62_">(62)</a></sup> Individuals found to have
violated the law may be pursued under both civil and criminal law.<sup><a href="#N_63_">(63)</a></sup> A civil action may result in
statutory damages of as much as $100,000 per infringement.<sup><a href="#N_64_">(64)</a></sup> Criminal penalties include fines
of as much as $250,000 and jail terms of as long as five years, or both.<sup><a href="#N_65_">(65)</a></sup>

<p><img src="/cyberspc/img4.gif" width="306" height="112" align="right" >Despite these formidable sanctions, only the
largest criminal syndicates are occasionally
caught.<sup><a href="#N_66_">(66)</a></sup> Even in those situations, the
criminals realize that they are likely to serve
only minimal time when prisons are
overpopulated with individuals convicted of
more heinous crimes.<sup><a href="#N_67_">(67)</a></sup> Additionally, the
charges against pirates are often greatly reduced or dismissed outright because of the general lack
of preparation in the law for these types of cases.<sup><a href="#N_68_">(68)</a></sup> Perhaps as a consequence of the lack of
prosecutions, the theft of software has been on the rise.<sup><a href="#N_69_">(69)</a></sup> The result is that the number of hours
law enforcement agents have dedicated to detecting and arresting software pirates has
dramatically increased as well.<sup><a href="#N_70_">(70)</a></sup>

<p>Contributing to the growth in software piracy is the fact that such activity is often considered
benign and lacks the social  stigma of  other  criminal  activity.<sup><a href="#N_71_">(71)</a></sup> As  a  result,  an  inordinate 
number of  individuals and corporations regularly give little consideration to the fact that  they 
are  illegally  pirating  software  when  they  distribute  multiple  copies  of   software.<sup><a href="#N_72_">(72)</a></sup> 

<p>Perhaps that lack of social stigma accounts for the finding that 35 percent of the software used in
the United States is unauthorized.<sup><a href="#N_73_">(73)</a></sup> See the related story in the sidebar.<sup><a href="#N_74_">(74)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech9"><p align="center">D. CREDIT CARD FRAUD</A>

<p>Depending on the source consulted, one might conclude that credit card fraud either runs rampant
on the Internet or is non-existent.<sup><a href="#N_75_">(75)</a></sup> However, despite these diverging conclusions, even industry
players admit that "it is possible to capture credit card and other sensitive information on the
Internet."<sup><a href="#N_76_">(76)</a></sup> The threat of credit card theft on the Internet exists because there is no universally
accepted method for preventing crackers from intercepting information as it travels from the
user's browser to the server.<sup><a href="#N_77_">(77)</a></sup> With experts estimating that ten billion dollars worth of
transactions will take place on the Internet by the year 2000, this lack of Internet security has led
industry leaders to look for more secure methods of transacting business.<sup><a href="#N_78_">(78)</a></sup> In response, financial
service companies have teamed up with technology leaders to develop payment applications that
are more secure.<sup><a href="#N_79_">(79)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech10"><p align="center">E. CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</A>

<p><img src="/cyberspc/img5.gif" width="306" height="158" align="right" >Child pornography is one crime that is clearly
illegal, regardless of whether the activity takes
place on or off the Internet.<sup><a href="#N_80_">(80)</a></sup> Perhaps the
most despicable of all crimes, child
pornography has begun to show up on the
Internet in droves.<sup><a href="#N_81_">(81)</a></sup> Child pornographers, or
pedophiles, can easily scan  and  distribute 
illegal materials by file server, bulletin board,
or through E-mail.<sup><a href="#N_82_">(82)</a></sup> Given the 

<p>inability of computers to differentiate between "innocuous" pictures and pictures that are
pornographic, along with the anonymity with messages can be posted, it is often  difficult to
locate the party responsible 

<p>for posting child pornography.<sup><a href="#N_83_">(83)</a></sup> There have even been accounts of pedophiles using bulletin
boards to contact each other.<sup><a href="#N_84_">(84)</a></sup> In addition, child molesters are also using the Internet to attract
unsuspecting victims: "Child molesters don't hand around candy stores and playgrounds anymore
. . . . They're finding kids through computers."<sup><a href="#N_85_">(85)</a></sup> See the related story in the sidebar.<sup><a href="#N_86_">(86)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech11"><p align="center">F. IP SPOOFING</A>

<p><img src="/cyberspc/img6.gif" width="306" height="112" align="right" >Spoofing, or IP spoofing, is the "act of
disguising one computer to electronically
'look' like another computer in order to gain
access to a system that would normally be
restricted."<sup><a href="#N_87_">(87)</a></sup> By deceiving a normally secure
computer systems into thinking that the
cracker who has breached the system is
actually a legitimate user, the spoofer is allowed virtually unlimited access to the system and its
contents.<sup><a href="#N_88_">(88)</a></sup> IP spoofing  is  so new that law enforcement, the judiciary and legislature have not
had  time  to  react.  As  a  result, the Internet itself has attempted to regulate spoofing with the
creation of various "filtering"   software    that    neutralizes    IP spoofing.<sup><a href="#N_89_">(89)</a></sup> See the related story
in the sidebar.<sup><a href="#N_90_">(90)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech12"><p align="center">G. PASSWORD SNIFFERS</A>

<p>Password sniffers are analogous to a wire tap.<sup><a href="#N_91_">(91)</a></sup> Sniffers are software programs capable of
monitoring and recording the name and password of network users as they log in, thereby
compromising security on that network.<sup><a href="#N_92_">(92)</a></sup> Password sniffing takes advantage of the fact that, in
many network setups, it is possible for any machine on a given network to hear the traffic for
every machine on that network.<sup><a href="#N_93_">(93)</a></sup> As a result, the data transmitted back and forth between
machines is there for anybody to capture.<sup><a href="#N_94_">(94)</a></sup> The password sniffer program monitors this
inter-machine communication in order to identify user names and passwords as they are
entered.<sup><a href="#N_95_">(95)</a></sup> With user name and password in hand, the cracker is then able to impersonate an
authorized system user, thereby allowing virtually unrestricted access to documents and files.<sup><a href="#N_96_">(96)</a></sup>

<p>Password sniffing is spreading rapidly, and threatens to affect a large number of network users on
the Internet.<sup><a href="#N_97_">(97)</a></sup> In fact, given the ever-growing presence of large public access systems, a single
password sniffer program is theoretically capable of collecting thousands of user names and
passwords.<sup><a href="#N_98_">(98)</a></sup> Once the cracker has the necessary names and passwords, every system can be
accessed.<sup><a href="#N_99_">(99)</a></sup> The best way to avoid becoming a victim of password sniffing is to employ
one-time, non-reusable passwords.<sup><a href="#N_100_">(100)</a></sup> That way, even if the user's password is stolen, it cannot
be used by the criminal perpetrator.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech13"><p align="center">H. E-MAIL BOMBS</A>

<p><img src="/cyberspc/img7.gif" width="306" height="167" align="right" >As the name implies, e-mail bombs essential
detonate thousands of messages in a person's
e-mail account, thereby crashing the
individuals internet server.<sup><a href="#N_101_">(101)</a></sup> These
"bombers" accomplish their unlawful acts by
using programs that allow upwards of 100,000
messages to be sent to one location.<sup><a href="#N_102_">(102)</a></sup> If  the 
criminal  has  access  to  a fast enough
modem, he or she can essentially dump 

<p>thousands of messages into the recipient's mailbox in a short period of time.<sup><a href="#N_103_">(103)</a></sup> When these
messages are transferred from sender to recipient, one of two things occurs: the bombing  either 
crashes the victim's internet 

<p>server, or the victim is inundated with thousands of messages that must be removed.<sup><a href="#N_104_">(104)</a></sup> See the
related story in the sidebar.<sup><a href="#N_105_">(105)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech14"><p align="center">IV. RESPONSES TO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ON THE 'NET</A>

<p>This section examines how various legislative and law enforcement entities have responded to
criminal activity on the Internet.  The response of law enforcement and the judiciary is briefly
reviewed, followed by a more detailed examination of several of the most important legislative
responses to crime on the Internet.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech15"><p align="center">A. LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE</A>

<p>Just as enterprising criminals employ the power of the new digital frontier to propagate crimes
against unsuspecting victims, so, too, has law enforcement harnessed this same power to "serve
and protect".  State and federal law enforcement organizations currently use the Internet to detect
and counteract criminal activity on the Internet.<sup><a href="#N_106_">(106)</a></sup> This strategy not only enables law
enforcement agents to actively pursue criminals, but also allows citizens to participate in
"keep[ing] the peace in their communities.<sup><a href="#N_107_">(107)</a></sup>

<p><img src="/cyberspc/img8.gif" width="373" height="334" align="right" >At the federal level, law
enforcement agencies have
established a growing presence on
the Internet.  In the late '80s and
early '90s, the U.S. Department of
Justice was confronted with a rapid
growth in computer related
crime.<sup><a href="#N_108_">(108)</a></sup> As a result, the
Department of Justice established a
special computer crime unit in
Washington, D.C., in order to assist
in the prosecution of high-tech
crimes.<sup><a href="#N_109_">(109)</a></sup> In 1992, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation created the
National Computer Crime Squad to
investigate violations of the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of
1986, discussed below.<sup><a href="#N_110_">(110)</a></sup> The
Federal Law Enforcement Training
Center has recently begun training federal officers in the science of cybersleuthing.<sup><a href="#N_111_">(111)</a></sup> The
United States Customs Service has even created a Child Pornography Program which gives cash
rewards to individuals who identify consumers of purveyors  of  child  pornography.<sup><a href="#N_112_">(112)</a></sup> These
are but a few of the federal agencies enlisted to "walk the cyber-beat".  The chart at right provides
the Universal Resource Locator for several of the numerous federal agencies responsible for
policing the Internet.

<p>Local law enforcement agencies have also gotten in on the act,  training  officers to detect  and
track   cybercriminals.<sup><a href="#N_113_">(113)</a></sup> In   fact, more than 2,000 police agencies now have a presence on the
Internet.<sup><a href="#N_114_">(114)</a></sup> In addition, many local law enforcement agencies use the Internet to seek out the
assistance of citizens in resolving unsolved crimes and apprehending wanted individuals.<sup><a href="#N_115_">(115)</a></sup> Law
enforcement web sites also informs citizens about criminal activity in their neighborhoods and
facilitates communications between the police and the citizenry.<sup><a href="#N_116_">(116)</a></sup>

<p>However, despite the growing presence of law enforcement, the reality is that investigating
criminal activity on the Internet is a very labor intensive undertaking.<sup><a href="#N_117_">(117)</a></sup> "Where a normal
investigator might handle 40 to 50 cases a month, for an investigator in high-tech crime, handling
three to four is a lot."<sup><a href="#N_118_">(118)</a></sup> Finally, as if the difficulties police confront in detecting and
investigating criminal activity on the Internet were not enough, prosecutors then encounter
another hurdle when confronted with attempting to prosecute cybercriminals using laws crafted
long before the concept of the Internet evolved.<sup><a href="#N_119_">(119)</a></sup> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech16"><p align="center">B. JUDICIAL RESPONSE</A>

<p>Traditionally, the judiciary viewed illegal computer activity as pranks, rather than as criminal
activity.<sup><a href="#N_120_">(120)</a></sup> That lackadaisical approach is evident from the data which shows the relative
infrequency with which crackers have been sentenced to anything more than probation and a
small fine.<sup><a href="#N_121_">(121)</a></sup> The trend has begun to change with the increasingly damaging nature of criminal
activity linked to computer crimes.<sup><a href="#N_122_">(122)</a></sup> However, despite the more realistic approach to computer
crimes, courts continue to have a difficult time fitting certain computer crimes within traditional
statutes.<sup><a href="#N_123_">(123)</a></sup> As a result, cybercriminals continue to receive much lighter sentences due to the
inability to specifically charge individuals under statutes which are tailored to their crimes.

<p>Even with the change in judicial attitudes towards computer crimes, several issues arise when
considering the prosecution of computer criminals.  Perhaps most importantly, it is difficult for
judiciary to weigh the merits of a high-tech crime under statutes that are often outdated, and
never intended to cover such activities.<sup><a href="#N_124_">(124)</a></sup> Additionally, courts are confronted with jurisdictional
issues given the omnipresent nature of the Internet.<sup><a href="#N_125_">(125)</a></sup> As one student succinctly stated, "[i]n the
physical world, drawing and maintaining boundaries are frequently the subjects of litigation.  It is
likely that virtual boundary definition will similarly become a popular subject of litigation, and
such definition will be no less legally problematic in the virtual world than it is in the physical
world."<sup><a href="#N_126_">(126)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech17"><p align="center">C. LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE</A>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Legislative attention to computer crimes grew dramatically in the early 1980s, as computers
became increasingly central to the conduct of business and politics.<sup><a href="#N_127_">(127)</a></sup> In fact, in 1981 no clear
laws prevented anyone from accessing military computers or the White House switchboard.<sup><a href="#N_128_">(128)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech18"><p align="center">1. FEDERAL RESPONSE</A>

<p>Since the federal government began prosecuting computer crimes, at least forty different federal
statutes have been employed to charge individuals committing crimes via the use of
computers.<sup><a href="#N_129_">(129)</a></sup> What follows is a overview of the most important of the statutes which have been
used to successfully prosecute crackers:<sup><a href="#N_130_">(130)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">a. THE COUNTERFEIT ACCESS DEVICE AND COMPUTER FRAUD

<p align="center">AND ABUSE ACTS OF 1984 &amp; 1986 &amp; THE COMPUTER ABUSE

<p align="center">AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1994: 18 U.S.C.  1030

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Passed in October of 1984, the Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of
1984 became the first federal computer crime law.<sup><a href="#N_131_">(131)</a></sup> The Act made it a felony knowingly to
access a computer without authorization, or in excess of authorization, in order to obtain
classified United States defense or foreign relations information with the intent or reason to
believe that such information would be used to harm the United States or to advantage a foreign
nation.<sup><a href="#N_132_">(132)</a></sup> The 1984 Act also outlawed access to certain financial records and access to use,
destroy, modify or disclose certain information found in a computer system.<sup><a href="#N_133_">(133)</a></sup> Despite the
laudable nature of the Act, critics claimed that it was ambiguous and too narrowly focused.<sup><a href="#N_134_">(134)</a></sup>
The Congress addressed these deficiencies when it amended the 1984 Act with the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.<sup><a href="#N_135_">(135)</a></sup>

<p>The 1986 revision of the Act was the culmination of several years of research and discussion
among legislators.<sup><a href="#N_136_">(136)</a></sup> One reason that it took several years to prepare the necessary revisions, and
likely the greatest obstacle to establishing those revisions, was the unforeseen difficulty of
gathering testimony from computer crime victims.<sup><a href="#N_137_">(137)</a></sup> Corporations were especially reluctant to
come forward with information about instances of victimization because they feared having their
vulnerability publicized.<sup><a href="#N_138_">(138)</a></sup> Based upon information gathered from testimony, three new crimes
were added to the Act.<sup><a href="#N_139_">(139)</a></sup> First, a computer fraud offense, modeled after federal mail and wire
fraud statutes, was added.<sup><a href="#N_140_">(140)</a></sup> The second addition created an offense for the alteration, damage or
destruction of information contained in a "federal interest computer."<sup><a href="#N_141_">(141)</a></sup> Finally, the knowing
and intentional possession of a prescribed amount of counterfeit or authorized "access devices"
was criminalized.<sup><a href="#N_142_">(142)</a></sup>

<p>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 was further refined by the Computer Abuse
Amendments Act of 1994.<sup><a href="#N_143_">(143)</a></sup> The Amendments eliminated the "federal interest computer"
language of the 1986 Act, and replaced it with broader language.<sup><a href="#N_144_">(144)</a></sup> The 1986 Act now applies to
anyone who "through means of a computer used in interstate commerce or communications,
knowingly causes the transmission of a program, information, code or command to a computer or
computer system . . . ."<sup><a href="#N_145_">(145)</a></sup> Thus, the section now protects privately owned computer systems
used in interstate commerce of communication, as well as federal interest computers.  The
Amendments also did away with the "access" requirement, and instead requires a specific intent
to perform certain acts which may constitute direct or indirect access.<sup><a href="#N_146_">(146)</a></sup> Finally, the
amendments also allow for civil remedies for damages cause by a violation of the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, and provides protection against actions which modify or impair
information or computers used in medical examination or treatment.<sup><a href="#N_147_">(147)</a></sup> 

<p>Violations of the 1994 Act are punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment, and up to 20 years for
repeat offenders.<sup><a href="#N_148_">(148)</a></sup> The 1994 Act also bestows the United States Secret Service, as well as other
authorized agencies, with authority to investigate violations of the Act.<sup><a href="#N_149_">(149)</a></sup> However, despite the
efforts of legislators to refine and amend the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, there have been
"pitifully few convictions" under any of the three Computer Fraud and Abuse Acts.<sup><a href="#N_150_">(150)</a></sup> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">b. FEDERAL MAIL AND WIRE FRAUD STATUTES: 18 U.S.C.  1341, 1343

<p>"The federal mail and wire fraud statutes prohibit using interstate wire communications and
mails to further a fraudulent scheme to obtain money or property."<sup><a href="#N_151_">(151)</a></sup> The mail fraud statute,
originally enacted in 1872, proscribes "any mailing in furtherance of a scheme that Congress
regards as contrary to public policy, even if it does not possess the power to regulate the
underlying fraud (the power is reserved for the states)."<sup><a href="#N_152_">(152)</a></sup> The wire fraud statute, adopted in
1952, expands the jurisdiction of the mail fraud statute to include wire transmissions.<sup><a href="#N_153_">(153)</a></sup> It has
been suggested that not only do these statutes seem to apply to "any computer-aided theft
involving the use of interstate wire, the mails or a federally insured bank," but they seem to cover
any attempt to obtain any unauthorized, or "pirated," copy of a software program.<sup><a href="#N_154_">(154)</a></sup> 

<p>In order for prosecutors to convict violators of the mail or wire fraud statutes, they must first
satisfy both prongs of a two-prong analysis.<sup><a href="#N_155_">(155)</a></sup> "First, the government must prove the formation
of a scheme with the intent to defraud; second, the government must prove that the defendant
used the mails or wires in furthering the fraudulent scheme.<sup><a href="#N_156_">(156)</a></sup> Violators of the mail and wire
fraud statutes are subject to fines, imprisonment, or both.<sup><a href="#N_157_">(157)</a></sup> If the party affected by the violation
is a financial institution, punishments can range from a fine of up to $1,000,000, imprisonment
for up to thirty years, or both.<sup><a href="#N_158_">(158)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">c. THE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT: 18 U.S.C.  2701

<p>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) was adopted as a means of
updating the antiquated mail and wire fraud statutes.<sup><a href="#N_159_">(159)</a></sup> The ECPA adds the unauthorized
interception of computer communications to the list of activities proscribed by 18 U.S.C.  1341
and 1343.<sup><a href="#N_160_">(160)</a></sup> The ECPA states, in essence, that:

<p>Anyone who intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through which an electronic
communication service is provided or intentionally exceeds an authorization to access that
facility and "thereby obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to a wire or electronic
communication while it is in electronic storage of such system" is subject to a fine of up to
$250,000 [under 18 U.S.C.  3571(b)(3)] and imprisonment for up to one year for a first offense if
the offense is committed for purposes of commercial advantage, malicious destruction or
damage, or private commercial gain.<sup><a href="#N_161_">(161)</a></sup>

<p>Subsequent offenses carry a maximum term of incarceration of two years.<sup><a href="#N_162_">(162)</a></sup> Additionally, if the
prosecution is unable to demonstrate the requisite level of criminal intent, sanctions are reduced
to $5,000 in fines and a six month maximum term of imprisonment.<sup><a href="#N_163_">(163)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">d. FEDERAL CHILD PORNOGRAPHY STATUTE: 18 U.S.C.  2252

<p>From a legal standpoint, those who use or provide access to child pornography face the same
charges whether the images are digital or photographic.<sup><a href="#N_164_">(164)</a></sup> Persons responsible for distributing
child pornography can be prosecuted, and such a suit could result in $50,000 or more in fines and
damages.<sup><a href="#N_165_">(165)</a></sup> Another issue raised by section 2252 is possession of pornographic material. 
Anyone who "knowingly possesses [three] or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, video
tapes, or other matter which contain any visual depiction [of child pornography] that has been
mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or which was
produced using materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported, by means
including computer"<sup><a href="#N_166_">(166)</a></sup> can be fined and imprisoned for up to five years.<sup><a href="#N_167_">(167)</a></sup> While the
requirement of knowledge may insulate some computer information systems such as networks, it
clearly does not protect computer users who knowingly traffic in pornographic material stored in
computer files.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">e. THE NATIONAL STOLEN PROPERTY ACT: 18 U.S.C.  2314.

<p>The National Stolen Property Act prohibits, <em>inter alia</em>, the transportation, transmittal, or transfer
"in interstate or foreign commerce any goods, ware, merchandise, securities or money, of the
value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud."<sup><a href="#N_168_">(168)</a></sup>
Courts have applied this statute to a number of computer-related crimes, including the fraudulent
computerized diversion of funds.<sup><a href="#N_169_">(169)</a></sup> Violators are subject to fines, or imprisonment for up to ten
years, or both.<sup><a href="#N_170_">(170)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech19"><p align="center">2. PROPOSED LEGISLATION: INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE ACT OF 1996</A>

<p align="center">(SPECTER-KOHL INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE ACT)

<p>Industrial espionage is a clear and growing threat to leading United States information
technology companies.<sup><a href="#N_171_">(171)</a></sup> In response, Senators Arlen Spector and Herb Kohl proposed a bill
intended to safeguard proprietary economic information valued at $100,000 or more.<sup><a href="#N_172_">(172)</a></sup> Software
source codes are among the protected economic information, in order to prevent theft or misuse
in espionage cases.<sup><a href="#N_173_">(173)</a></sup> By and large, software source code "does not qualify as property under the
federal criminal code and the laws of most states."<sup><a href="#N_174_">(174)</a></sup> As a result, prosecuting the theft of such
source code has typically been under the antiquated 60-year-old Wire Fraud Act, an act not
designed for industrial espionage cases.<sup><a href="#N_175_">(175)</a></sup> In terms of penalties, the bill subjects violators to
fines, asset forfeiture and up to 15 years in prison.<sup><a href="#N_176_">(176)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech20"><p align="center">3. STATE RESPONSE</A>

<p>In addition to the previously mentioned federal computer crime statutes, the states have also
taken part in developing statutory limitations specifically designed to address crime as it relates
to computers.  In 1978, Florida became the first state to enact a computer-specific criminal
statute.<sup><a href="#N_177_">(177)</a></sup> Over the next eighteen years, every state, save Vermont, has enacted some form of
computer crime statute.<sup><a href="#N_178_">(178)</a></sup>

<p>State statutes have been fashioned to handle a wide variety of unlawful activity.<sup><a href="#N_179_">(179)</a></sup> According to
one commentator, "state statutes cover at least ten distinct categories of offenses."<sup><a href="#N_180_">(180)</a></sup> These
statutes can be categorized as follows:

<p align="center">a. Expansion of the Definition of Property.<sup><a href="#N_181_">(181)</a></sup>

<p>Some states have simply attempted to address computer crimes by bringing electronic mediums
under the purview of "property".<sup><a href="#N_182_">(182)</a></sup>

<p align="center">b. Unlawful Destruction of Programs or Files.<sup><a href="#N_183_">(183)</a></sup> 

<p>State computer abuse statutes frequently contain language prohibiting the "alteration, damage,
deletion, or destruction" of computer programs or files.<sup><a href="#N_184_">(184)</a></sup> This language sufficiently covers the
most threatening forms of unlawful computer-related activities.<sup><a href="#N_185_">(185)</a></sup>

<p align="center">c. Use of Computers to Commit, Aid, or Abet Commission of Crimes.<sup><a href="#N_186_">(186)</a></sup>

<p>Many state statutes prohibit the use of a computer to commit, aid, or abet in the commission of
criminal activity.<sup><a href="#N_187_">(187)</a></sup> These statutes seek to curb such activities as theft, fraud and
embezzlement.<sup><a href="#N_188_">(188)</a></sup>

<p align="center">d. Crimes Against Intellectual Property.<sup><a href="#N_189_">(189)</a></sup>

<p>"This type of statute defines new offenses in terms that are analogous to trespassing
(unauthorized computer access), vandalism (maliciously altering or deleting data), and theft
(copying programs or data)."<sup><a href="#N_190_">(190)</a></sup>

<p align="center">e.  Knowingly Unauthorized Use of Computer of Service.<sup><a href="#N_191_">(191)</a></sup> 

<p>Some states prohibit the use or access of computers when that use or access supersedes the level
of authorization consented to by the owner.<sup><a href="#N_192_">(192)</a></sup>

<p align="center">f.  Unauthorized Copying of Computer Files or Software.<sup><a href="#N_193_">(193)</a></sup>

<p>Statutes prohibiting the "unauthorized duplication or copying of computer files or software"
somewhat resemble the federal Copyright Infringement Act.<sup><a href="#N_194_">(194)</a></sup> By and large, such statutes are
rare.<sup><a href="#N_195_">(195)</a></sup>

<p align="center">g.  Prevention of Authorized Use.<sup><a href="#N_196_">(196)</a></sup>

<p>Adopted by approximately a quarter of all states, this type of statute forbids activities that
restricts or limits the ability of users to obtain the full functionality of their computer or computer
systems.<sup><a href="#N_197_">(197)</a></sup>

<p align="center">h.  Unlawful Insertion of Unauthorized Material.<sup><a href="#N_198_">(198)</a></sup>

<p>Several states currently have on their books statutes which prohibit the introduction of
unauthorized materials into a computerized environment.<sup><a href="#N_199_">(199)</a></sup> Such statutes criminalize the
implantation of computer viruses and similar "contaminants".<sup><a href="#N_200_">(200)</a></sup>

<p align="center">i.  Voyeurism - Information Gathering.<sup><a href="#N_201_">(201)</a></sup>

<p>A few states have enacted statutes designed to protect the privacy of computer users by
prohibiting unauthorized entry into computer systems, even if the purpose is a benign as simple
voyeurism.<sup><a href="#N_202_">(202)</a></sup>

<p align="center">j.  "Taking Possession of"<sup><a href="#N_203_">(203)</a></sup>

<p>Statutes falling under this category prohibit unauthorized users from exerting control over a
computer or computer system.<sup><a href="#N_204_">(204)</a></sup>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech21"><p align="center">V. CONCLUSION</A>

<p>Attempting to gauge criminal activity on the Internet is somewhat like trying the ascertain the
size of an iceberg: while it is readily apparent how large the iceberg is on the surface, it is
difficult to know how much more lies under the surface.  In much the same manner, it is almost
impossible to comprehend how many cybercrimes go undetected by simply examining the vast
array of readily available information.  Moreover, even when there is some consensus about the
existence of criminal activity on the Internet, the various governmental and private entities all
seem to espouse differing views about how to resolve it.  

<p>Some experts view hackers and crackers as beneficial to the continued growth and development
of the Internet by forcing computer system administrators to secured their networks.<sup><a href="#N_205_">(205)</a></sup> To these
individuals, "[h]ackers are not the poison, they're the antidote."<sup><a href="#N_206_">(206)</a></sup> Others believe that the best
answer is to allow the Internet to regulate itself.<sup><a href="#N_207_">(207)</a></sup> Finally, the government believes it should be
the final promulgator of laws regulating the use, and abuse, of the Internet.

<p>Regardless of how one views the phenomenon of criminal activity on the Internet, one thing is
certain: it is here to stay.  Just as the global marketplace underwent drastic change following the
industrial revolution, so, too, will the information revolution forever alter society, and crime, as
we know it.

<p>The future of commerce on the Internet is intricately connected first and foremost with domain
names.  Domain names are a company's location, advertising, slogan, and business card all rolled
into one.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  As long as controversy and uncertainty surrounds the issue of domain names, the
Internet will not reach its full potential as a medium of commerce.  After outlining a brief history
of the Internet and trademark law, the article will focus upon the complex interplay between
domain names, law, and commerce.  The current legal and administrative framework will be
examined, and because the current frameworks will not provide the ultimate resolution of the
domain name controversy, proposed solutions will be critically analyzed and evaluated.  Finally,
this article will forecast the most likely result of today's proposed solutions, precedent, and
thought.

<p><a name="tech2"><em>The Internet</em></a>

<p>In the 1960s, the United States Department of Defense wanted to establish a decentralized
computer network that allowed rapid data transfer and yet could survive a military attack.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  To
accomplish this goal, various unconnected networks such as ARAPNET, universities, and other
organizations established gateways in order to pass information back and forth.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  Gradually,
academic institutions around the world began to take advantage of the Internet.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  In 1993, the
National Science Foundation ("NSF") created the Network Information Center ("InterNIC") to
provide general technical oversight of the Internet.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  Three different companies contracted to run
InterNIC -- AT&amp;T, General Atomics, and Network Solutions, Inc. ("NSI").<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  AT&amp;T provided
directory services, General Atomics managed the information services, and NSI was responsible
for continued operation of the registration services established by the Address Number Authority
("IANA").<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>    At the same time, a group of interested companies formed the Internet Society
("ISOC"), a nonprofit organization, to provide administrative oversight of the Internet.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 
Although the ISOC has no governmental authority, InterNIC usually follows the Society's
policies.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> 

<p>Today, the independent networks which compromise the Internet contain several million "host"
computers.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>  Approximately twenty-five million individuals are served by these host
computers.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> It is the IANA's responsibility to assign a unique address to each one of these
hosts.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>  The assigned address is really compromised of two addresses -- a numeric Internet
Protocol (IP) address (e.g., 123.45.789.0) and an alphanumeric domain name (e.g.,
"www.ttu.edu").<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  The current Domain Name System ("DNS") consists of a database which
translates the alphanumeric domain name into the numeric IP address.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>  A domain name
consists of a string of "domains" separated by periods.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  For example a typical domain name is
"www.howdy.com".  The "www" represents a home page that a user can access via the World
Wide Web; the "howdy" domain is the host computer link to the Internet; and ".com" is a
worldwide hierarchical domain level for commercial organizations.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>  The alphanumeric domain
name is clearly the most useful address for commercial purposes.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>  It is much easier to
remember the address "www.apple.com" than it is to remember 345.345.232.11.  This makes
alphanumeric addresses much more desirable for businesses, and consequently, the number of
<em>useful</em> alphanumeric addresses is rapidly decreasing.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>

<p>The desirability of domain names made conflict over the ownership of domain names inevitable. 
Initially however, InterNIC had not considered the importance and implications of registering
domain names.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>  InterNIC contended "Registering a domain does not confer any legal rights to
that name, and any disputes between parties over the rights to use a particular name are to be
settled between contending parties using normal legal methods."<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>  InterNIC simply registered
domain names on a "first come, first serve" basis.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>  Conflicts and "domain grabbing" occurred
almost immediately.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>  In response, InterNIC announced a new policy in September 1994: one
domain name per organization.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a> This new policy created inequities and caused practical
problems for large corporations.  The policy allowed companies that had previously registered
multiple names to keep them, while new registrants were limited to one domain name.  Hence,
large "late" registering companies were limited to single names despite the number of
subsidiaries, and early registrants were allowed to continue the use of as many names as they had
registered.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>

<p>This policy did not stop domain grabbing.  In October 1994, fourteen percent of the Fortune 500
companies found that they could not register their most desirable name.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>  Nevertheless,
InterNIC continued to assert "You guys need to come to some agreement of your own.  We're
just a registry, not an enforcer."<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>  It was not that InterNIC did not care, it simply did not have
the personnel to evaluate each potential domain name registrant for trademark conflicts.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> 
Consequently, the International Trademark Association ("INTA") formed a task force to
"examine and identify the difficulties in protecting corporate identities on the Internet."<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>  In
addition, the Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") began allowing domain names to be
registered as trademarks.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>  Shortly thereafter, INTA approved a resolution that provided domain
names may function as trademarks, and use of domain names can result in infringements of
trademark rights.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>  InterNIC, however, did not recognize this resolution.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>

<p>In July 1995, InterNIC did change its policy regarding domain names, only to revise that policy a
few months later.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>  Then, in an attempt to stem the geometrically increasing rates of
registration, InterNIC instituted a $50.00 annual fee for all five of the top-level domains it
administers.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>  The revised November 1995 policy maintained the "first come, first serve"
registration basis, but required registrants to state that they had legal right to the application-domain name.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>  In addition, if the trademark owner disputed the ownership of the domain and
the domain name owner had no proof of a trademark, the domain name address could be
suspended until the situation was resolved.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>  In the case the trademark was ambiguous or
unclear, the domain name owner had to agree to indemnify InterNIC for any litigation costs or
face suspension of the domain.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>  This new policy simply served to protect InterNIC.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>  No
substantive changes to the policy were made.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>  More recently, InterNIC has implemented a
fourth policy.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>  This policy will be discussed later in the article.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>

<p><a name="tech3"><em>Trademark Law</em></a>

<p>Trademark law is based upon two separate premises: <em>protecting the public and marketplace from
confusion</em>, and <em>guarding property interests</em> in recognizable names, symbols, and goodwill. 
Although trademarks have long enjoyed protection at common law, Congress passed the first
federal trademark law in 1870 pursuant to the Commerce Clause.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>  This Act was struck down
as unconstitutional.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>  In 1946, the present trademark regulations came into existence under the
Lanham Act.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>  Trademark protection only extends to those marks used in interstate and foreign
trade.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>  While trademark protection is only given in a limited jurisdiction, the scope of
protection within that jurisdiction is very broad.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>  Words, pictures, shapes, packaging, and
colors have all been given protection.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>  In order to maintain their protected status, trademarks
must continue to remain distinctive.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>  If a trademark becomes the common or generic
representation of goods or services it is turned over to the public domain.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>

<p>Although almost anything can be given trademark protection, the Lanham Act does not permit a
trademark to be registered if it

<p>1.  Is immoral, deceptive, or scandalous or disparages or falsely suggests a connection with
persons, institutions, etc.; or

<p>2.  Is a flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the U.S., state, municipality or foreign nation; or

<p>3.  Is a name, portrait, or signature of a particular living individual without written consent; or

<p>4.  Resembles a mark which is registered in the PTO or a mark previously used in the U.S. by
another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause
confusion or cause mistakes or deceive; or

<p>5. Consists of a mark which is merely descriptive.<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>

<p>Once a mark has been given trademark protection, Lanham Act  43(a) allows the owner of a
mark which is being infringed to bring an action against the infringing party.  Infringement is
established by showing a "likelihood of confusion" in the marketplace.<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>  This is an inherently
subjective test.  However, if there is actual confusion in the marketplace, a majority of
jurisdictions treat infringement under strict liability principles.<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>  Good faith or mistake is no
defense.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>

<p><center><a name="tech4">II. Domain names, Trademarks, and the Internet </center></a>

<p>Unfortunately, trademark law and domain names do not merge seamlessly together.  This is
because domain names do not fit neatly into traditional frameworks of analysis.   Much like
postal addresses, domain names serve as addresses on the Internet.  However, domain names are
much more than the physical location of a company or organization.  In addition to functioning as
a physical location, domain names are advertising tools which suggest what is at a particular
location.  The address "16131 SW 104<sup>th</sup> Ave" does not suggest what type of business is located at
that address, while the address "www.mcdonalds.com" clearly suggests the McDonalds resides at
that particular location in cyberspace. 

<p><em><a name="tech5">The Chaotic History</em></a>

<p>The brouhaha concerning trademarks and domain names caught almost everyone associated with
the Internet by surprise.  As mentioned previously, InterNIC had not anticipated any such
problems.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>  The original policy regarding domain names simply worked on a "first come, first
serve" basis.<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>  This hands-off policy led directly to domain grabbing for innocent and not-so-innocent reasons.  For example, in August 1994, Jim Cashel registered eighteen "famous"
domain names such as "hertz" and "esquire" just out of curiosity.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>  The holders of these marks
did not contact him, and he eventually relinquished them to InterNIC.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>  

<p>One of the most famous early domain name controversies involved Adam Curry and MTV.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a> 
Adam Curry, an MTV VJ, registered the name "mtv.com" with the approval of MTV
management.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>  When Curry left MTV, MTV sued to recover the domain name "mtv.com".<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a> 
The merits of the case were never reached by a court, and the dispute was ultimately settled.<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a> 
The court, however, did address pre-trial motions.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>  In a published opinion related to these
motions, Judge McKenna noted that domain names are similar to telephone number
mnemonics.<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>  Many scholars have taken note of this and analyzed domain name trademark
problems in the context of telephone number mnemonic trademark cases.<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a>  

<p>Trademark law allows alphanumeric mnemonic telephone numbers to be used in such a way as to
warrant trademark protection.<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a>  In <em>Dranoff-Perstein Associates v. Sklar</em>, the two parties used
almost identical telephone mnemonics.<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>  In 1984, Dranoff-Perlstein began using "INJURY-1"
as the telephone number for their personal injury law practice.<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a>  In 1990, Harris Sklar began
using "INJURY-9" as the telephone number to identify his law practice.<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>  The court held that
the alphanumeric combination "INJURY" was generic.<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>  The addition of a "1" or "9" to the end
of INJURY did not sufficiently change the generic nature of the word.<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>   The court remanded
the case because they could not determine from the facts whether secondary meaning had been
established.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>

<p>In another noteworthy telephone mnemonic case, <em>American Airlines, Inc. v. A 1-800-A-M-E-R-I-C-A-N Corp.</em>, the court addressed the issue of whether an owner of a mark may protect
infringement of that mark by a telephone mnemonic.<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a>  American Airlines, Inc. owns the service
mark "AMERICAN AIRLINES", and had established the secondary meaning of their mark
"AMERICAN".<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>  A travel reservation service began advertising as "A 1-800-A-M-E-R-I-C-A-N" in the yellow pages under "Airline Companies".<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>  The court easily found that by such
advertising, the company A 1-800-A-M-E-R-I-C-A-N intentionally created confusion in the
marketplace.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>  Hence, A 1-800-A-M-E-R-I-C-A-N Corporation was enjoined from using the
AMERICAN mark as a name or telephone mnemonic.<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a>  The decision is important because it
established that American Airlines could enjoin the use of their registered service mark as a
telephone mnemonic.<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a>  Both of these telephone mnemonics cases offer interesting frameworks
for analyzing domain name-trademark disputes.  It follows from <em>American Airlines</em> and <em>Curry</em>
that domain names which infringe valid trademarks are actionable.  Just as trademark law applied
directly to telephone mnemonics, so also trademark law can apply directly to domain name use in
commerce.<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>

<p>Besides the dispute between Adam Curry and MTV, there have been numerous other conflicts
over the ownership and use of domain names.  Princeton Review registered its competitor's
probable domain name -- "kaplan.com" -- and used the site to solicit and list complaints about
Kaplan.<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>  Joshua Quittner registered the domain name "mcdonalds.com" in order to get a
response from the ultra-sensitive McDonald's Restuarant company.<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a>  Sprint Communications
attempted to register its competitors domain name "mci.com", but InterNIC discovered the
mistake and re-registered it to MCI.<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a>  While none of these disputes ever made it to court, some
conflicts have and are being examined and decided through the court system.  

<p>In<em> ActMedia, Inc. v. Active Media International, Inc.</em>,<em> </em>the court reached the merits of a case
involving a domain name controversy.<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a>  ActMedia had been in the advertising and promotional
business since 1972.<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a>  ActMedia used its mark "ACTMEDIA" in association with these
services.<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a>  When ActMedia sought to register the domain name "actmedia.com", they were
precluded from registration because Active Media International had already registered the
name.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a>  The court determined that Active Media International's use of "actmedia.com" violated
the Lanham Act, Illinois common law, and the Illinois Anti-Dilution Statute.<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a>  It is important to
note that ActMedia and Active Media International were competing in the same market for
presumably the same customers.<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a>  This made the decision of the Illinois Federal District Court
much easier.<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a>  Nonetheless, this decision is important because it clearly establishes that domain
names may infringe upon federal and common law trademarks, and illustrates the use of an anti-dilution statute to hold the infringer liable for an unauthorized use of a mark.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>

<p>Cases involving computer bulletin boards also provide useful analogies on how to legally analyze
and understand domain name disputes.  In <em>Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Frena</em>, Playboy sued a
bulletin board over the unauthorized use of their marks "PLAYBOY" and "PLAYMATE."<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a> 
While the bulletin board itself did not incorporate or use the marks to advertise itself, board
operators used the marks within image files distributed through the bulletin board system.<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a>  The
court held that the public could easily confuse the images as being sponsored or sanctioned by
Playboy.<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a>  In a similar case, <em>Sega Enterprises, Ltd. v. Maphia</em>, an elecronic bulletin board was
being used as a conduit for the unauthorized exchange and sale of Sega games.<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a>  Each game
sold from the bulletin board retained the Sega logo and emblem.<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a>  Again the court determined
the public could easily be confused about the source of the illegal games.<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a>  In both situations
the trademark infringement was within a computer file.<a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a>  However, both cases were also full-blown piracy.<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>  There was only one conclusion the court could equitably make in both
scenarios.<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a>  These cases suggest that the way the marks are used does not make a difference in
the court's analysis.  In other words, if a protectible mark is used within a web page or domain
name, the owner of the mark will have an action against the infringing party.

<p>More interesting situations arise when two companies that do not share a common market fight
over the ownership of a domain name.  Under the current DNS there is only one desirable top-level domain for commercial entities to registered under -- ".com".  It is like the entire country
has the same area code.  Therefore, Qwerty's Electronics and Qwerty's Bait and Tackle may both
want to register the domain name "qwertys.com".  Unfortunately, even if Qwerty's Electronics is
in Boise, and Qwerty's Bait and Tackle is in Key Largo, there can only be one "qwertys.com" on
the Internet.  Traditional trademark law allows such separate and distinct marks to be used
concurrently because neither shares a market or geographical area.<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a>  However, the Internet has
been viewed as, and is, one expansive, global market.  There are at least two important cases
pending concerning this very issue.  In <em>Fry's Electronics, Inc. v. Octave Systems, Inc.</em>, there is a
dispute over the domain name "frys.com".<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>  Frenchy Fry's uses the domain name to market its
french fry vending machines and catering service in the Seattle area; however, Fry's Electronics
-- a computer retailer in the San Francisco area -- owns the trademark "FRYS", and wants to
use that mark for their own site.<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a>  Fry's Electronics has brought six different causes of action
against Frenchy Fry's: (1) Unfair competition under the Lanham Act  43(a); (2) RICO charges;
(3) Unfair competition under state common law; (4) Trade name infringement under common
law; (5) Injury to business reputation; and (6) usurpation of property.<a href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a>  If this case continues to
a trial on the merits, it should prove to be a watershed case on how courts will handle trademark
disputes concerning separate markets and geographical regions.<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a>

<p>The domain name dispute between Clue Computing, Inc. ("CCI") and Hasbro also has a chance
of going to trial.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a>  This case has been litigated in Colorado state court.<a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>  CCI has registered
and continues to use the "clue.com" domain name.<a href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a>  Hasbro would like to use that site to
market their board game Clue, which does have trademark protection.<a href="#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a>  Hasbro complained to
NSI about the use of "clue.com", and NSI threatened to place the domain on hold.<a href="#N_107_"><sup>(107)</sup></a>  Before
they could act, CCI filed a suit against NSI alleging among other things that NSI could not
retroactively apply their current policy and that NSI's actions were arbitrary and capricious.<a href="#N_108_"><sup>(108)</sup></a> 
In response to CCI's actions, NSI filed an interpleader action in federal court.<a href="#N_109_"><sup>(109)</sup></a>  This is usually
used when their is some property in dispute between two parties of which a third party controls. 
This case raises the same issues as <em>Fry's Electronics</em> -- will traditional trademark law apply to
domain names in cyberspace?

<p><a name="tech6"><em>The Law At This Hour</em></a>

<p>As can be seen from the preceding section outlining the development of trademark and domain
name jurisprudence, there are few premises and principles that are clear and concrete.  The
uncertainty of the law has been made even more uncertain since the recent release of yet another
Domain Name Dispute Policy from InterNIC.<a href="#N_110_"><sup>(110)</sup></a>  InterNIC dropped the word "resolution" from
the title of their policy to emphasize the fact that they want no part in settling any of the disputes
which will arise over the use of domain names.<a href="#N_111_"><sup>(111)</sup></a>  InterNIC's fourth policy clarifies their
position on domain name registration without many other substantive changes.<a href="#N_112_"><sup>(112)</sup></a>  The major
theme of the policy is shifting responsibility away from NSI.<a href="#N_113_"><sup>(113)</sup></a>  In other words, NSI is perfectly
content to sit back and allow the courts or the parties to determine what, if any, action needs to be
taken.<a href="#N_114_"><sup>(114)</sup></a>

<p>General trademark principles have been relied upon to resolve all disputes to date that have not
settled.<a href="#N_115_"><sup>(115)</sup></a>  It is clear that an action for trademark infringement -- under the Lanham Act or
common law -- is available to the owner of a mark against an economically competing party.<a href="#N_116_"><sup>(116)</sup></a>
The question remains whether the owner of a mark will have an action against a party which uses
the owner's mark as a domain name but does not conduct business in the same geographical
region or compete with the owner.<a href="#N_117_"><sup>(117)</sup></a>  While courts have not yet decided such a case, there is no
reason that they cannot be handled like any other traditional trademark infringement case.

<p>Regardless of trademark law, owners of "famous" and distinctive marks will still have protection
for their marks under state and federal anti-dilution statutes.<a href="#N_118_"><sup>(118)</sup></a>  State dilution statutes protect
owners of distinctive marks from having their mark blurred or tarnished.<a href="#N_119_"><sup>(119)</sup></a>  A number of states
such as Illinois already have anti-dilution statutes in place.<a href="#N_120_"><sup>(120)</sup></a>  The U.S. Congress has just passed
a new federal anti-dilution law.<a href="#N_121_"><sup>(121)</sup></a>  Currently, such laws have not been used extensively to
address trademark dilution on the Internet.  The use of such statutes should grow, however, as
owners of famous marks need a way to police the use of their marks by non-competing
entities.<a href="#N_122_"><sup>(122)</sup></a>

<p>Additionally, states have the power to pass legislation aimed at curbing trademark abuse.  Two
states are in the process of implementing such laws.  Georgia has recently passed the "Internet
Police" Bill amidst heavy protest.<a href="#N_123_"><sup>(123)</sup></a>  California Senator Charles Calderon is also pushing a
trademark protection law through the California legislature.<a href="#N_124_"><sup>(124)</sup></a>  If states can pass laws regulating
the Internet which pass Constitutional muster, it is still doubtful how these laws will apply.  Such
laws will have a difficult time handling the global nature of the Internet.  While communication
within the state may be regulated, few Internet communications are solely contained within the
United States, let alone a specific state.

<p><a name="tech7"><center>III. Options For The Future</center></a>

<p><a name="tech8"><em>Trademark Law</em></a>

<p>Trademark law can and will be the dominant legal force used to handle future domain name
disputes and conflicts.  The basis and founding principle of trademark law is to prevent confusion
in the public marketplace.  There is a significant amount of case law and history surrounding
trademarks in the United States.  In addition, under the Lanham Act national protection is given
to marks.<a href="#N_125_"><sup>(125)</sup></a>  While the Internet and domain names require different perspectives and knowledge,
traditional trademark law can easily adopt to these needs. 

<p>A majority of the disputes over domain names can be split into one of two categories: pirating or
good faith use.  For those situations in which a person or company registers a domain name in
order to prevent its use by another individual or company, or blackmail the domain name's
<em>rightful</em> owner, traditional trademark law provides a clear solution.  Regardless of competition or
non-competition between the companies, or remote geographic location, the individual or
company that registered the mark in bad faith will not be able to retain or use the mark.  Even in
cyberspace, these domain name pirates fall easy prey to traditional trademark law.

<p>Good faith users of marks that infringe valid trademarks present a more difficult situation.<a href="#N_126_"><sup>(126)</sup></a> 
Normally, if the product and market are dissimilar or remote, marks may be used concurrently. 
However, under the current DNS a specific domain name can be held by only one person,
company or organization.  There cannot be any concurrent use of a domain name.  Even under
the current DNS, trademark law presents an equitable solution to the problem of a finite number
of desirable domain names.  Just as the telephone company distributes phone numbers via a "first
come, first served" method, NSI can continue to register names in a "first come, first served"
manner.  As long as the good faith registrant does not use the mark in a way to confuse the
public, the mark may be used freely.  This encourages responsible use of the Internet, and makes
it imperative for companies to register any mark they plan on using as soon as possible.

<p>Overall, there is no imperative need to redraft any aspect of trademark law to fit the world of the
Internet.  As seen above, traditional trademark law is entirely capable of handling and equitably
deciding any disputes which arise over domain name use.  Trademark law, coupled with anti-dilution law, concrete InterNIC policy, and technological advance, is unequivocally capable of
efficiently and fairly resolving the disputes of tomorrow.

<p><a name="tech9"><em>Anti-Dilution Statutes</em></a>

<p>Traditionally, anti-dilution statutes have been the domain of the states.<a href="#N_127_"><sup>(127)</sup></a>  However, The Federal
Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 ("FTDA") has changed this trend.  In January 1996, Congress
passed the much needed FTDA.<a href="#N_128_"><sup>(128)</sup></a>  Injunctions and remedies on a national level were always
questionable under state anti-dilution law.<a href="#N_129_"><sup>(129)</sup></a>  While States did issue injunctions on a national
level, the jurisdictional basis for such an injunction was shaky at best.<a href="#N_130_"><sup>(130)</sup></a>  President Clinton
solved this problem with a stroke of a pen when he signed the FTDA into law.  The FTDA gives
owners of "famous" marks an easy way to combat the appropriation of their mark as a domain
name by an unauthorized user.  Unlike trademark law, the theory of dilution involves the view
that a company's mark is property.<a href="#N_131_"><sup>(131)</sup></a>  Hence, any use -- or trespass -- of that property which
blurs or tarnishes that mark is actionable -- whether or not the owner and user are competitors
and whether or not the unauthorized user intended to misuse the mark.

<p>The statute itself, inserted into the Lanham Act, contains a definition of dilution and seven
factors to evaluate the "famous" nature of the mark.<a href="#N_132_"><sup>(132)</sup></a>  The act allows nationwide injunctions
and damages if the owner can prove an intent to dilute the mark.<a href="#N_133_"><sup>(133)</sup></a>  This statute provides owners
of famous marks a straightforward way to police the use of their mark.  In one of the first cases
involving the FTDA and the Internet, Hasbro, Inc. successfully gained a preliminary injunction
against Internet Entertainment Group ("IEG") for the use of their domain name
"candyland.com".<a href="#N_134_"><sup>(134)</sup></a>  In the preliminary injunction order, the judge held that IEG's use of
Hasbro's mark "CANDYLAND" will most likely be found to dilute the strength of the mark. 
Clearly the limitation upon owners of marks using this statute is that it is limited to famous
marks.<a href="#N_135_"><sup>(135)</sup></a>  While an owner can always argue their mark is famous, owner's of not-so-famous
marks will most likely have to attack the infringing use of their mark through different legal
avenues.<a href="#N_136_"><sup>(136)</sup></a>

<p><a name="tech10"><em>InterNIC Policy</em></a>

<p>The trend has been for InterNIC to become more and more involved with the disputes over
registered domain names.<a href="#N_137_"><sup>(137)</sup></a>  This trend should not only be stopped, it should be reversed.  Just
as the telephone company has no place in the middle of a legal dispute over whether a telephone
number or mnemonic infringes a trademark, so also InterNIC has no place in any dispute about
the use of a domain name.  InterNIC -- NSI specifically -- is simply a registrar.  They should
not have any other responsibility.  InterNIC should simply refrain from putting domain names
and sites on hold or recalling domain names until instructed to do so by a court of competent
jurisdiction or the registrant of the domain.  Otherwise, NSI should continue to register domain
names on a first come, first served basis.  This will allow NSI to perform its function without the
interruptions of individuals and companies seeking to put names on hold, and free individuals,
companies, and the courts to sort out the law surrounding domain names and trademarks.

<p><a name="tech11"><em>Technological Change</em></a>

<p>The most promising option to resolve, at least partially, the conflict between trademarks and
domain names is technological change.  The current DNS is widely thought to be unduly
restrictive and burdensome.  There are not enough options to allow companies and individuals to
share cyberspace in peace.  For example, currently names can only be up to 24 characters long. 
This significantly restricts the number of desirable names.  Additionally, the .com top level
domain is akin to having one area code for the entire commercial world.  That would, and in fact,
does not work.  Additional geographic domains would simplify, clarify, and allow easier
application of trademark law regarding concurrent use of a mark.  For example, a grocery store in
Perrine, FL could have the domain name "www.apple.perrine.fl.com", while the large computer
company could be identified with the domain name "www.apple.usa.com".  These changes may
seem unwieldy, but in the long run they would prove to be both descriptive and easily
remembered.  Such changes would increase the applicability of trademark law, and at the same
time reduce the competition and bargaining for ideal domain names.

<p><a name="tech12"><center>IV. Conclusion</center></a>

<p>While many people and scholars question whether trademark law can apply to the Internet in
general, and domain name disputes specifically, it is relatively clear that traditional trademark
law can and will resolve any problems in the same manner traditional trademark disputes are
settled.  The Internet is different, but it is not so different as to necessitate an entire paradigm
shift within the jurisprudence of trademark law.  The combination of traditional trademark law,
federal and state anti-dilution statutes, technological change, and the reduced involvement of
InterNIC will effectively piece together a solution to a problem which hinders the commercial
growth of the Internet.  The initial chaos and uncertainty will quickly give way to opportunity for
the wise businessman as soon as a few decisions are reached by courts throughout the country.<a href="#N_138_"><sup>(138)</sup></a> 
The best plan is quick action and patience.  Quick action to register any important trademark as a
domain name, and patience to allow the courts to catch up with the rush of litigation and
technology.

<p align="center"><a name="tech1"><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong></a>

<p>The divisive issue of obscenity has been rekindled by easy access to cybersmut on the Internet. 
The Supreme Court remains unwilling to revisit previous decisions on obscenity.  In terms of
constitutional guarantees this does not translate well for today's technological society.  
Pornographers and purveyors of obscene cybersmut are often times indistinguishable.  As a result
of the increased popularity of the Internet, regulations have been passed to discourage the
disseminators of cybersmut from transmitting images which could be construed as obscene. 
Because reasonable people can differ on what constitutes obscenity, the application of the law is
often unjust because it relies on the least tolerant elements of society to create a de facto national
obscenity  standard.  While obscenity regulation seems essential, society would be less repressed
if it permitted its citizens to view what they chose without unwarranted prior restraint.This work delves into key areas relating to obscenity standards as applied to the Internet.  In the
interest of constructing a meaningful historical backdrop and ambiance, the life and death of
Socrates will be discussed.  The connection between the modern day debate centering on
obscenity traces its genesis directly to the trial of Socrates.  The text will also contain relevant
quotes from other figures that offer an excellent philosophical framework for discussion of
obscenity.  This issue lends itself to serious analysis not limited to court holdings and statutes. 
To fully appreciate the issue of obscenity regulation, one must delve into the culture which seeks
to regulate it.   

<p>Subjective biases guide the obscenity debate.  Therefore, any analysis on the subject is bound to
be less than partial.  Because of this reality, the image of  Socrates will help give support and
serve as a historical gauge for contemporary historical analysis of this emotionally driven subject. 
The authors and artists chosen to be included in this work provide in some unique way an
esoteric streak of rebellion to the obscenity debate.Section IV includes statutory analysis pertaining to the Internet.  The analysis will focus on the
types of liability different parties might incur as a result of both behavior and legal status.  For
example, legal distinctions between content providers and access providers form the critical line
of division which indicates what defenses are available to defendants.   There will also be a brief
discussion on the controlling cases in the area of Internet liability for access providers, content
providers and mere recipients of obscenity.  Next, the analysis will focus on the most important
contemporary case,<em> United States v. Thomas</em>.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
<p><em>  </em>Here a husband and wife were imprisoned for the
transmission of obscene images vis-&agrave;-vis the Internet.  They are currently serving over five years
in prison for this egregious offense.  This case best illustrates the need for legal reform in the area
of obscenity regulation. 

<p>Another case which illustrates the glitches in the current system is the story of a male university
student who decided to post graphic stories depicting violent assaults on a female coed in his
school.<em><a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
<p> </em>  Though his act is more vile than that of the Thomas', he is a free man today.   

<p>Finally, an alternative to the current test used in the area of obscenity regulation will be offered. 
The  "virtual community standard"<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
<p> could be adopted by the Supreme Court.  The concept of
what constitutes community will be explored.  Ergo, do the people of an intolerant community
possess more rights than people of more tolerant communities to monitor and censor what is
transferred across the Internet?  Ultimately, the commentary will turn to the suggestion of a
workable non-criminal system of accountability by way of tort action as a method for handling
obscenity which actually causes damage.  The current system of regulation does not require any
proof of actual harm, not even in the criminal law.  The moral virtue of the community is what is
allegedly being preserved by enforcement of obscenity laws.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><a name="tech2">II. OBSCENITY DEFINED</strong></a>

<p>Even assuming Congress had the will to pass new legislation that clearly defined obscenity in a
way that limits sanctions to civil remedies its application would be burdened by the subjective
nature of the definition of obscenity itself.  Black's Law Dictionary offers this definition on the
subject of obscenity: 

<p>Material is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to the prurient interest,
that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and if in addition it goes
substantially beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters. 
Predominant appeal shall be judged with reference to the ordinary adults unless it appears from
the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be designed for children
or other specially susceptible audience.  Undeveloped  photographs, molds, printing plates, and
the like shall be deemed obscene notwithstanding the processing or other acts may be required to
make the obscenity patent or to disseminate it.  This definition is based on Model Penal Code 
251.4.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>
<p>Regardless of who is interpreting the statute for prosecution, the stain of personal bias, including,
but not limited to different communities' subjective sexual bigotry will always be present.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
<p> 
Tolerance is taught in the classroom in American schools.  Why then do political leaders divide
based on race, religion, ethnicity and sexual morality?  American cultural leaders in Congress,
print press and electronic media have done a serious disservice to the Internet by placing the
baggage of archaic thought about sex on the modern society it impacts.  Old conceptions about
what constitutes obscenity and how it is to be determined and punished are quickly being
outmoded by globalization infinitely sped up by the Internet. 
</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><a name="tech3">III. CHILD PORNOGRAPHY: A GLOBAL DISGRACE</strong></a>

<p>Child pornography is widely available on the Internet according to many sources.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>
<p>  Images
which constitute obscenity are readily available on many Usenet sites.  Much of the rhetoric
which lines this debate rests on the faulty assumption that regulations imposed by Congress and
the Court will save children from harm.  The central problem is that enforcement in the area of
obscenity takes needed funds away from units that would actually investigate child pornography
brokers and criminal rings. The drum beat sounds for the protection of children, yet in practice
the lack of focus continues.

<p>Think back to a time when people had security, at least as a member of a definable community. 
This was a time when criminals had to transport the implements of their criminal conspiracies to
reap the benefit of the crime itself?  Consider that today individuals are far removed from their
neighbors, yet there is a vehicle which unites the entire world by way of satellites, fiber optics,
computer networks and the list continues to grow longer every day.  Changes are being
introduced at such a staggering rate that to people several generations ago would have been
unimaginable.  

<p>Even more unbelievable is the level of misuse on the Internet possible by individuals whose
singular purpose is to perpetrate the most heinous of crime.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
<p>  As the nuclear family unit
disintegrates it is replaced with the extended cyber family.  Without the fear of border checks,
crime has began to mutate into new, even more dangerous forms.  Across the Internet, on a daily
basis, there are perpetual challenges to the United States' obscenity standards and child
pornography standards. Due to the impact of the Internet the very nature of crime has changed to
fit this medium of exchange.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, if a child pornographer wanted to conduct business, he risked possessing,
transporting and delivering the contraband to an end user in a face-to-face transaction.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>
<p> The
business was deep underground.  Now, the Internet easily facilitates the flow of child
pornography and other forms of obscenity.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>
<p>  To show the persuasiveness of cybersmut demand
Debra Burke details Internet use patterns as follows:

<p>The demand for cybersmut caused the University of Delft in the Netherlands to unplug an
experimental project involving a database of digitized pornography  and Carnegie Mellon
University to cut sexually oriented news groups on Usenet from its Internet Servers. A recent
study conducted through Carnegie Mellon University entitled Marketing Pornography on the
Information Superhighway suggests that over eighty-three percent of the pictures on Usenet
groups which stored digitized images were pornographic. While the study suggests a pervasive
presence of smut in Cyberspace, Usenet represents only 11.5% of the traffic on the Internet,
which itself is only a part of Cyberspace.  Other statistics suggest that less than five percent of the
bulletin boards on the net offer cybersmut.<sup> </sup><a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Theoretically, if a community were comprised of a dominant bigoted religious community it
could declare obscene pictures merely pertaining to sex.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>
<p>  The doctrine of inverse interpretation
leads to the analysis of what is not obscene.  The statutory law does not describe what is the
acceptable minimum standard in the area of obscenity regulation.  If the law attempted to ordain
certain things as not being obscene, the obscenity standard itself would be more discernible for
those who desire to comply.  Scienter requirements are really quite low as exemplified in
<em>Thomas</em>.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>
<p>  However, Congress as well as state legislatures have provided a fairly complex web
of regulations in this area of the law.  

<p>The destruction of the individual family unit continues, while the Internet links sick and
perverted extended cyber communities in ways never dreamed of by even the most vile
cybersmut purveyors ten years ago.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>
<p>   With over 120 nations plugged into the Internet, citizens
of the United States risk being exposed to "hard core" pornography and  child pornography.  As
the government clamps down on individual civil liberties the business of child exploitation
continues business as usual.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>
<p>  The individual's right to determine what one wants to view is lost
due to obscenity regulation.  This covers far more than pornographic art, it covers "true artists"
whose brand of art is repulsive to the community. The First Amendment should protect vulgar
speech, and it generally does.  However, because the Internet is a conduit vehicle, much like a
cable system, it receives less protection than pure verbal speech.  Especially, when images are
being sent across state lines for monetary compensation.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>Due to the Internet, sovereignty is tested in unique ways. As with any macro political entity, the
government vis-&agrave;-vis its activists engineer societal transformation by political pressure.  One
major proponent for censorship is Catharine A. MacKinnon.  She seeks to use the government as
a tool for maternalistic censorship.  Rejection of both patriarchal and matriarchal models are
essential if the gender gap is to be lessened.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>
<p>  MacKinnon appreciates the significance of the
struggle to be free from oppression as demonstrated in her writings.  Therefore, the criticism
from the left is more troublesome because it is well intentioned.

<p>The age old problem is simple: once the United States starts making exceptions to freedom and
constitutional guarantees, the nation slides down a slippery slope somewhere between Hegelian
statism and anarchy.  Georg Hegel wrote, " As high as mind stands above nature, so high does
the state stand above physical life. Man must therefore venerate the state as a secular deity. . . .
The march of God in the world, that is what the State is."<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>
<p> Hegel's legacy of dialectic thought
brought the world several major political movements that helped lead to the oppression of the
individual.  Therefore, because the Internet obscenity debate is rooted in the debate concerning
the proper role of government regulation in the individual's private life, its significance is
evident.  Hegel's writings offer an excellent foundation for the discussion of state abuse.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> 

<p>As we contemplate our differences let us not forget one man's vice is another man's virtue.
Compare the crime of murder to the crime of purveying obscenity in legal terms.  It is clear when
a murder has occurred in many cases.  People could agree a murder had taken place if presented
with a corpse full of bullet holes.  People with different religious and cultural backgrounds would
probably be able to agree that when a dead body is recovered with evidence of criminal assault by
another human being, such as a gunshot wound, that this would constitute grounds to investigate
a possible murder. <strong> </strong>Judgment of obscenity is too subjective even within a given community that
can be geographically defined. Therefore, application of standards from community to
community over the Internet seems impractical and unfair on its face. 

<p>The obscenity and censorship debate is nothing new.  In fact, one of the most sophisticated legal
minds the world has ever venerated was put to death for corrupting the hearts of the youth. 
Socrates initiated the Socratic question-and-answer method of teaching as a means of achieving
self-knowledge by apprehending truth.  This methodology is routinely used in law school and
other academic environments.  His theories of  justice, virtue and ideas about life have survived
in writings such as <em>Phaedo, Apology</em> and the<em> Republic</em>. Plato wrote virtually everything that
survives until this day regarding Socrates' plight. Socrates was tried for corrupting the minds of
Athenian youth and subsequently put to death.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>
<p>  He sought wisdom about what formed the
foundation of right honorable conduct.  He lead many of the moral and intellectual improvement
initiatives of Athens. Using the only genuinely original Socratic method, he would stump
students by pursuing questions, especially simple questions, and examining the implications of
their always insufficient answers.  

<p>Socrates, mistakenly described by some as the first <em>sophisticated </em>apologist for the wicked,
wanted people to use their minds to make good decisions, not immoral decisions based on
irrational fear.  He opined that no one knowingly does evil things. He looked at the soul as the
repository of  consciousness and moral disposition.  He also believed the universe's chaotic
nature could be ordered by the human mind. Also, he was known for his criticism of the
Sophists. Religious heresy was one of  the bases used to put Socrates to death.  Ultimately,
Socrates was convicted and, unwilling to resist the offers of leniency, willingly drank the cup of
poison hemlock given to him to swallow.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>Concerning the mind's fallibility, including moral judgments, Socrates said, "Whenever,
therefore, people are deceived and form opinions wide of the truth, it is clear that the error has
slid into their minds through the medium of certain resemblances to that 

<p>truth." <a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>   With so much knowledge, Socrates could not be allowed to survive in his temporal
plain where the superstitious and ignorant set moral definitions of what constituted acceptable
moral conduct.  Lies can not live next to truth for very long.  Plato's summation described the
error that crept into the mind of humanity concerning truth and morality.  Negative reactions to
obscenity force men to deal with the darkest side of their reality. 

<p>Here is an example of what type of utterances led Socrates to his destiny.  He surmised, "Every
pleasure or pain has a sort of rivet with which it fastens the soul to the body and pins it down and
makes it corporeal, accepting as true whatever the body certifies."<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>
  This quote illustrates the
link between the mind and the body.  In the sixties the phrase "if it feels good, do it" was heavily
criticized as being at its core, immoral.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>
  In actuality, it was a call to do things that did not cause
pain and misery, such as was being caused by the conflict in Vietnam War. Only through the
twisting of moralists did sick interpretations of what was meant by the phrase, did people start
using the phrase to describe debauchery.  An innocent, beautiful affirmation of life was perverted
by those who came to defend all of us from such filth in the name of decency.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>Returning to the phrase, "if it feels good, do it", in fact, "that which the body certifies as good",
generally, is in actuality good.  The problem arises when one considers who is saying it and why. 
Simply, if whatever it is that one does when feeling good is a "sin" in the mind of the participant,
then the act itself is tainted by psychological preexisting bias.  Therefore, it stands to reason that
one espousing such "Easy Riderisms" as, "if it feels good do it" would be viewed as an immoral
person in the judgment of another listening who happens to have a particular moral bias against
the actual practice of free thought, let alone the exercise of  free speech and conduct in the form
of personal sexual expression.  Contrast the life and message of Socrates with the statement "if it
feels good do it".  Socrates spoke his final words just before being sentenced to die, "The hour of
departure has arrived, and we go our ways--I to die and you to live. Which is the better, only
God knows."<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>
<br>  These are the last words of his speech to the court following the sentence of
death imposed on him by the Athenians.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>
 

<p>The Internet could potentially serve as a vehicle for bringing freedom never imagined even in the
progressive sixties except by a few visionaries.  Timothy Leary, one of the more colorful
philosophers of the modern era, made the connection between freedom and trust of the individual
to choose right from wrong. He thought that life was a spiritual quest which different people
reacted to uniquely, but that at some point in their development the individual would answer the
ancient call to express oneself artistically and spiritually.  A whole generation celebrated as the
yolk of their ancestors were removed and a new day was born with freedom of individual
expression at its core.  It took a radical like the late Timothy Leary, as well as many others left
and right, to teach us that our differences are positive.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>   The consummate prankster was quoted
in 1989 as saying "In the information age, you don't teach philosophy as they did after feudalism.
You perform it. If Aristotle were alive today he'd have a talk show."<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>Finally, concerning the issue of what one chooses to view and the effect it might have on the
soul, Socrates said, "I was afraid that by observing objects with my eyes and trying to
comprehend them with each of my other senses I might blind my soul altogether."<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>
  This
illustrates the relevance that images have on our essence as human beings.  To have no moral
bearing would leave humanity with no guide.  However, as things currently exist arbitrary
outcomes occur as a result of the Court's unwillingness to revamp a decent obscenity definition
for Internet application. Ultimately, the definition that comes as a result of this debate will lead to
broader protections for all citizens.  

<a name="tech4"><p align="center"><strong>IV. THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK</strong></a>

<p>Courts have played an integral part in the of building of a framework from which the  sketchy
statutory law was given texture.  The Congress has passed a series of provisions which are
designed to protect the public from the deleterious effects of obscene materials. The debate
continues in the area of Cyberspace.  The standards applicable to computer based
communications over the Internet are governed by the same law that governs other mediums of
exchange.  The problem of what standard of judgment to apply in deciding whether the work is
obscene is of paramount importance.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>
<p>   

<p>The laws governing obscenity are not primarily statutory in nature.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>
 However,  several laws are
relevant to obscenity: (1)18 U.S.C.  1462 involves penalties for the importation and
transportation of obscene materials;<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>
<p> (2) 18 U.S.C.  1461 makes it criminal to mail obscene
material<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>
<p>; and 18 U.S.C.  1465 which describes the penalties for transporter of obscene
material for monetary gain.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>
<p>  These three statutes form the core bases of federal obscenity
prosecutions.  

<p>Because the law itself fails to define what obscenity is per se, citizens are left with the three
prong test provided in <em>U.S. v. Miller</em>.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>
<p>  Here the Court provided the three prong test currently
used for obscenity analysis.  With respect to criminal liability stemming from the Internet for
end-users, as well as Bulletin Board [hereinafter BBS] operators, criminal liability on the Internet
concerning obscenity eventually could be  governed by  502 of the Telecommunications Act of
1996, popularly known as the "Decency Act",  which makes obscene communications by way of
computer with a child under the age of 18 a crime.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>
<p>502 was originally designed to be
applicable to offenses conducted from telecommunication sources.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>The pertinent text of  223 (d) provides that, whoever, uses an interactive computer service to
send to a person under 18 years of age, "any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, images or
other communication that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs,
regardless of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated the communication."<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>
<p> 
 223(a) and (d) target the criminal penalties at content providers not merely access providers
like CompuServe or Sprynet.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The purpose of  223 (a) and (d) was to target the criminal penalties at content providers who
violate this section and persons who conspire with such content providers, rather than entities
that offer general access to the Internet.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>
<p>  Content providers were at serious risk under the new
provision if the material is provided to a child under the age of eighteen.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>
<p> This law was very
well designed, in one respect, in that it targets adults who provide cybersmut or indecent
communications to persons under the age of eighteen.  Nevertheless, what is obscene?  The
statue still leaves this open to interpretation.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>
<p>  Because minors are involved, the Court will have
more latitude in defining obscenity since the audience receiving it is not mature enough to view
obscenity without being emotionally harmed.   

<p>The conferees drafting the decency legislation intended that the access provider defense be
construed broadly to avoid impairing the growth of on-line communications through a strict
regime of vicarious liability.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>
<p>  Senators did not really want to clamp down on obscenity much
as they wanted, as not to impair the corporate access providers from enjoying a free ride in terms
of liability.  The purpose of the legislation was to hold content providers of obscene cybersmut
criminally liable, while not unfairly punishing those entities whose only connection with the
obscenity was to serve as an Internet access provider.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>
<p> Congress wisely removed much of the
confusion in the area of vicarious liability for mere access providers.  However, the question of
smaller BBS' liability for pictures and correspondence by its members posted to public bulletin
boards which it operates still remains.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>
<p>     Eventually, the Supreme Court will have to deal with
whether or not the  Decency Act is constitutional.       

<p>To illustrate this point, consider CompuServe's liability when stacked up against a small BBS. 
CompuServe would have a good defense to liability in the area of vicarious liability for
connecting the user to the sight which contained the obscene material, such as the Thomas' BBS,
Amateur Action BBS, "The Nastiest Place on Earth".  Similarly, CompuServe might not be able
to avoid liability if obscene materials were posted on one of CompuServe's local boards by one
of its members. There are questions concerning whether it had an internal practice of screening
images and correspondence, or if it simply allowed individual members to freely post.  The old
question of whether or not an access provider is vicariously liable for connecting a user to a site
posting obscene material has been addressed by the Congress in the section, yet numerous
questions remain about interpretation of the statute as applied.  The issues are so new that no
cases have ripened as of yet to be able to determine the depth of protection granted by this
legislation. 

<p>Another important issue is the potential liability for those who download obscene images.
Matthew Siderits provides the following working definition for uploading and downloading:

<p>Uploading is a process whereby a user sends a message or file via modem to an on-line service,
which is essentially another larger computer system. Once uploaded, the message or file can be
read by other users of the service. Downloading is the inverse process: selecting a file located on
the on-line service and retrieving it via modem to the user's personal computer.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>When considering the fact that many users are unfamiliar with the technology that they are using
in the first place it could be virtually impossible to show that a person with actual intent stored
and transported an image outside of his premises, thereby violating the law concerning transport
of obscenity beyond the protected confines of one's own residence.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>
<p>  This type of problem
exemplifies how far removed this problem is from the type of cases pondered earlier this century
by the Court.        

<a name="tech5"><p align="center"><strong>V. THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN OBSCENITY
STANDARD: THE ROTH TEST</strong></a>

<p>Several cases will be addressed to detail the amorphous nature of the obscenity standard.  Many
working definitions have evolved over time which all were supposed to operate as a means by
which courts and juries would be required judge the moral attributes of a particular work.  The
very fact that the Court took it upon itself to dictate morality is disturbing. The crime of
purveying obscenity is an anomaly in American criminal jurisprudence due to the fact that one
may face criminal penalties for thoughts that give rise to productions which  offend the public's
artistic or moral sensibilities.<em></em>

<p><em>Roth v. United States</em><a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>
<p> was<strong> </strong>the first case in an ongoing series of decisions that<strong> </strong>held obscenity
was not constitutionally protected speech or press.  Both the state and federal government can
ban such speech even though the regulation would be based upon content.<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>
<p>  The Court
previously had eluded to the fact that obscenity was not protected under the First Amendment. 
However, this was the first case which held that it was not protected<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>
<p>   The Court frowned on
any protections for obscenity in the early phases of constitutional development.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Roth </em>developed as a result of the Court unequivocally rejecting many of its past holdings. The
Court preferred a more objective formulation in its analysis instead of the English "most
susceptible persons" <em>Hicklin</em> test.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>
<p>  While<em> Roth </em>provided a better definition than previous
decisions, the flaws inherent with its version of what constituted obscenity were readily apparent. 


<p>The Court temporarily required the following test to be used when determining if something is
obscene, "whether  to the average person applying community standards, the dominant theme of
the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest."<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>
<p>  In <em>Manual Enterprises Inc. v.
Day,</em><a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>
<p>  the Court included in its laundry list of elements the requirement that the material be
patently offensive. It is evident that the Court and society are incapable of agreeing on what
constitutes obscenity.  What constitutes prurient interests is  difficult to determine, so when the
entire question is posed to a jury no rational outcome can be expected from case to case and
jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  This pattern of disparity will only grow more obvious with time and
inattention.  Therefore, how can citizens living under the law created by this body comply in
good faith?  The Supreme Court could remove itself from part of this problem by allowing free
speech to flow unrestrictedly. 
<P><a name="tech6"><p align="center"><strong>VI. A HINT OF ENLIGHTENMENT: THE MEMOIRS TEST </strong></a>

<p>A plurality of the Court, in <em>Memoirs v. Massachusetts</em><a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>
<p> included the famous "utterly without
redeeming social value" language.   The early progeny of <em>Roth </em>defined obscenity as the merger of
three elements: "(1) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient
interest in sex; (2) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community
standards; and (3) the material is utterly without redeeming social value."<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Difficult as it might be to believe, this definition ultimately proved dissatisfying to the Court.  In
fact, it never commanded a majority.  From this historical crossroads, the Court started making
case by case decisions on what constituted obscenity. This fiasco is what lead to Justice Potter
Stewart's famous quote:

<p>I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of materials I understand to be embraced
within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so.  But
I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that."<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Justice Stewart's quote should lead any observer awe struck.   The real impact is on the criminal
defendants who are tried as if a lottery system were in effect in the U.S. system of justice.<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>
<p>  
</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech7"><p align="center"><strong>VII. THE MILLER TEST</strong></a>

<p>Ultimately, in 1973, the Court in <em>Miller v. California</em><a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>
<p><em> </em> provided a new test for obscenity which
shifted the balance of responsibility back to the jury to decide what is and is not obscene. The
trier of fact must consider: (1) whether "the average person, applying contemporary community
standards" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;  (2)
whether the work depicts or describes in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically
defined by the applicable state law; and (3) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>
<p>  The <em>Memoirs </em>"utterly without redeeming social
value" language was rejected as unworkable.<em><a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>
<p> </em>  Today the <em>Miller</em> test still functions as the
guideline used for instructing a jury what standards they must use when applying the obscenity
statute to the individual being tried.  The <em>Miller</em> test fosters a level of subjectivity that is
intrinsically unfair to criminal defendants.<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a>
<p>  The value of the status quo definition in <em>Miller</em> is
severely strained when communities that otherwise had only independent phone connections
between callers now offer obscene material vis-&agrave;-vis the Internet.

<a name="tech8"><p align="center"><strong>VIII. THE STANLEY EXCEPTION</strong></a>

<p>In 1969 the Court held in <em>Stanley v. Georgia,</em><a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a>
<p><em>  </em>"that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit making the mere private possession of obscene material a crime."<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>
<p>  The Court further reasoned that, "Whatever the power of the State to control public dissemination of
ideas inimical to public morality, it cannot constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability
of controlling a person's private thoughts."<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a>
<p>  Yet that is exactly the effect of the Court's ruling. 
As a caveat it is important to understand that the Court's rule in<em> Osborne v. Ohio</em><a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>
<p><em> </em>which held
that this protection does not apply to possession of child pornography.<em>  </em>

<p>There are other exclusions to the <em>Stanley</em> exception.  For example, in <em>United States v. Orito</em>,<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>

<p>the Court sent a clear signal that the international importation of obscene material is not
lawful,<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>
<p> even if for recipient's personal use and possession was lawful.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>
<p>  In light of the
decision in <em>Bowers v. Hardwick</em>,<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a>
<p> one can only guess how the Court would have ruled on
<em>Stanley </em>if it were presented today for the first time. In <em>Bowers </em>the Court concluded that sexual
relationships between gays are not constitutionally protected forms of expression.   Aside from
all the clutter of past Supreme Court decisions, one should appreciate <em>Miller</em> is the authoritative
case involving the obscenity standard.<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>
<p>  In<em> New York v. Ginsberg</em>,<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>
<p>  Justice Black remarked
"obscenity exists only in the minds and emotions of those who believe in it, and is not a quality
of a book or picture."  His logic reflected the level of understanding and respect for the
Constitution missing in much of the modern debate.  Black's statement sheds light onto the
argument for discontinuing the criminal regulation of obscene material.  The subjective nature of
the debate makes it impossible for the Court to legislate morality effectively and fairly.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech9"><p align="center"><strong>IX. CONTEMPORARY CASE LAW</strong></a>

<p>In <em>Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co.</em>,<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>
<p> where Prodigy found itself being sued for
allowing some of its users to post defamatory statements, the court held Prodigy vicariously
liable.  The court noted it thought that, "computer bulletin boards should generally be regarded in
the same context as bookstores, libraries and network affiliates."<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a>
<p>   This line of reasoning
certainly threatened the growth of the Internet because it would have meant a steady stream of
criminal actions against access providers.  Essentially, an access provider would have been
criminally liable for merely offering its customer a link to the Web.   The most important case in
the area of obscenity is <em>Thomas</em>.<em><a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a>
<p> </em> In <em>Thomas</em>,<em> </em>the court applied the community standards test
with the result of sending a husband and wife to jail for transmitting obscene material for
profit.<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>
<p>  The Thomases decided to post pornography which they had purchased at a local adult
bookstore in their California community.<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>
<p> They scanned the pictures and charged individuals a
fee by credit card for the right to access their hard drive and download pornographic images.<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a>
<p> 
In <em>Thomas</em>, though the filth they purveyed, none of which was actually proven to be child
pornography,<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a>
<p> was relatively innocuous in comparison to the filth disseminated by the Socrates
in relative terms.  The same pictures that landed the Thomases in jail still exist on the Internet
due to the fact that every person who visited the Amateur Action BBS downloaded the illegal
images and presumably did not promptly delete them.  The obscene relationship between
government abuse in his situation and the Thomas' is striking.  The age changes, but the song
remains the same.   

<p>Once the order was received, a voice verification phone call was placed to insure minors were
not fraudulently gaining access to the adult material.<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a>
<p>  Even after they took extraordinary
precautions, before the mandatory requirements to screen out children, they still fell prey to the
antiquated doctrine of community standards fostered by <em>Miller</em>.<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>Reportedly, the Thomases where thriving in their business endeavors. Local authorities,
including the District Attorney and Attorney General said the "Nastiest Place on Earth" did not
violate California's obscenity standard. While the Thomases were acting in good faith and in
compliance with the law of California, they were in violation of federal law as applied in the 4<sup>th</sup>
Circuit.<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a>
<p>  To adhere to an ever shifting subjective standard dependent on a community in time
and space is not practical.  It also overly burdens the rights of people who want to communicate
by way of modem through the Internet.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a>

national standard in the vacuum of a clear super majority opinion of what constitutes obscenity .   
 

<p>In the absence of statutory or case law, the Court must define that which equity requires binding
resolution, especially if an ongoing societal burden is involved.  In this case, the Court could
keep the <em>Miller</em> test while striking down the artificial constraints as defined in <em>Miller</em>.<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a>

<p>  Generally,
individuals make the connection between individual responsibility and freedom.  Nevertheless,
many of the same people who cry out for individual responsibility for issues they favor, switch
positions on issues like taking individual responsibility as a parent.  If people are legally
mandated to get out of the gutter of Welfare, concerned parents will not be overly burdened to
insist that their service provider incorporate a child block program which customers could
download once on-line without charge.  By the cyber community taking responsibility, it can
potentially ward off future attacks by the those who do not value the free flow of information.

ANALYSIS:  THE ARTISTS' RESPONSE TO THE CHARGE OF CORRUPTING SOCIETY'S MORALS </strong></a>

<p>If there is a less restrictive means available, the Supreme Court could opt for that alternative
ultimately, especially if it is already in use within the interested and affected computer user
population. Individual responsibility is touted by many when discussing the appropriate role of
the individual welfare recipient to take personal responsibility for his or her own life.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>
<p>  Is it not
hypocrisy for those same concerned citizens not to take personal responsibility for their own
households' Internet viewing habits?   Those desiring to suspend the First Amendment's
applicability to the Internet need only look in the mirror to find the answer to the question why
American society should reject calls to government censorship.

<p>Does one really want to be governed by someone in this area of personal taste?  What is obscene
to one man is a symbol of worship and adoration to another.  How far from happiness and
community acceptance must Socrates have been when Plato wrote, "There are a great many of
these accusers, and they have been accusing me now for a great many years, and what is more,
they approached you at the most impressionable age, when some of you were children or
adolescents; and literally won their case by default, because there was no one to defend me."<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a>
<p> 
Many feel they know the truth, yet the hubris of a knowing man has greater impact than the
impact of ignorance on the fool.   

<p>The Supreme Court of the United States by default and reliance on stare decisis, accomplished
what Justice Brennan argued should have been done in 1973 under <em>Miller</em>, which was to create a
workable national standard for obscenity.<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a>
<p> The new standard post <em>Thomas </em>is de facto Zero-Tolerance, with only the <em>Stanley</em> exception to curtail more governmental abuse as a result of the
community standards test announced in <em>Miller</em>.<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a>
<p>  This legacy of default is a shameful blow to
the Constitution.

<p>If the government is allowed to erode rights piece by piece, only a shell of the Constitution will
eventually remain.   Standing up for the right to engage in free speech is often difficult and not
always popular.  With popular speech there is no need to defend its right to exist.  However, the
mark of our democracy will be whether it can increase tolerance, or constrict it even further. 
American culture is steadily moving toward a Hegelian slide into fascism or some other
socialistic state of totalitarianism.<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a>
<p>  The assault could come from either the left or right.  The
problem is that once the government establishes hegemony over the Internet it can then dictate
conduct of the users.  Some people love government control, that is until their art is checked off
the list of acceptable items.    Unpopular speech is scorned and ridiculed.  Therefore, protection
of this disfavored speech is where the battle begins.  Obscenity itself is not to be defended per se,
whatever obscenity is.  However, the right to be free from government intrusion into such a
sensitive area is of great importance to the individual who might have different tastes and desires
than the majority.  What harm is there except in the hurt feelings of the dominant elite that the
rules have been broken?

<p>The struggle for freedom was fraught with many heartaches and failures.  As with any social or
political movement leadership is essential.  However, what if along the way one realizes that
nobody remaining cares about the truth?  In Gregory Armstrong's, <em>Protest: Man against Society,</em>
he wrote concerning Ibsen's <em>An Enemy of the People</em>,

<p><em>An Enemy of the People</em> is the story of the education of a revolutionary. At the beginning of the
play, Ibsen's hero, Dr. Stockmann, overflows with naive faith in the natural goodness of man.
His first disillusionment comes when his brother, the mayor, attempts to suppress a report
exposing the organic pollution of the waters of the local spa.  Undaunted he next pins his hopes
on the press, which in turn forsakes him for its own selfish interests.  They prove to be sheep,
easily manipulated by the political leadership of the town.  Only when Dr. Stockman is forsaken
by the entire community does he realize, as every hero and rebel must, that the only ally he can
count on is himself and his own conviction of the truth.  From the realization that "the strongest
man in the world is the man who stands most alone. <a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>Dr. Stockman finally gains the necessary strength to  . fight.  Like so many other agitators in life,
Dr. Stockman learned that the truth was something few desired to learn.

<p>The most eloquent dissertation on the role of the artist as dissenter was give to society through
Francoise Gilot in <em>Life with Picasso</em>.<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a>
<p>  Picasso suggests the necessity of absolute opposition
between the state and the artist regardless of the nature of the government.  He said:

<p>The point is, art is something subversive. It's something that should <em>not</em> be free. Art and liberty,
like the fire of Prometheus, are things one must steal, to be used against the established order. 
Once art becomes official and open to  everyone, then it becomes the new academicism ." I 
[Francoise Gilot]  reminded him that Malherbe had said a poet is of no more use to the state  than
a man who spends his time playing ninepins.  "Of course," Pablo said.  "And why did Plato say
poets should be chased out of the republic?  Precisely  because every poet and every artist is an
antisocial being.  He's not that way  because he wants to be; he can't be any other way.  Of
<em>course</em> the state has the right to chase him away--from its point of view -and if he is really an
artist it is in his nature not to want to be admitted, because if he is admitted it can only mean he is
doing something that is understood, approved, and therefore old hat--worthlessbut the right to
free expression is something one seizes, not something one is given.<a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On censorship he quipped,  "Art is never chaste. It ought to be forbidden to ignorant innocents,
never allowed into contact with those not sufficiently prepared...Yes,   art is dangerous.  Where it
is chaste, it is not art."<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>  Picasso's insight on the subject of art as a means of political expression
illuminates why government attacks on "obscenity" cause repression, not redemption or
salvation. 

<p>When obscenity standards are applied to conduct based speech, society must be aware there is a
corresponding price for freedom surrendered.  It is difficult to let others do as they choose, yet
the more the United States encourages freedom, the stronger the nation becomes as an ideal
democratic unit.  Confidence in the basic decency of man is a prerequisite for letting a society
mature properly.  A new standard based on the views of the end-user community is the
appropriate basis to judge these cases.  <em>Ginsberg </em>exemplifies the proposition that the Court has
already built in a variable community standard based on who is the likely viewer of the material
being challenged as obscene<em>.</em><a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a>
<p>  Preferably this new standard would be used in a graduated way,
always using as its guide for what is or is not obscene the community standard of the affected
group. 

<p>In <em>Ginsberg </em>the Court reasoned by analogy that the community standard is to be judged by the
community it is intended to impact.<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a>
<p>  In practice, this means if it is an exotic dance club at
issue, then obscenity would be judged from that group's standard.  Complaints would have to
come from the community itself to even warrant investigation.  The first two prongs of the<em> Miller</em>
test use community standards to arrive at the conclusion of whether or not the work as a whole
appeals to a prurient interest in sex or describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way. 
When this standard is applied to the community of Internet users its frailties become even more
apparent. 

<p>With respect to the third element of the <em>Miller</em> test, which asks the trier of fact to determine
whether or not the entire work lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, the trier
is asked to make a subjective judgment call.  Nevertheless, a reasonable person standard is used,
as set forth and described in <em>Pope v. Illinois</em>.<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>
<p>  However, a national standard of reasonableness
is conveniently avoided.  Consequently, the most  intolerant communities will, by default,
determine what the Internet community can transmit.<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>If an individual in the community is proximately harmed by obscene speech, the speech should
be curtailed. It is often said that the law was not designed to protect groups, but rather
individuals.  Why do the proponents of this type of individualism stand up on this issue as well? 
On the Internet, obscenity should not be regulated by communities remote to the server, and
arguably servers should not be controlled by bureaucrats. A nexus of intolerance exists in our
people and leaders which cause the market of violent  pornography to exist in the first place. <em>  </em> <em> </em>

<p>How can anything two consenting adults do be obscene, except in the mind of the person who is
offended by the consensual act?<a href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a>
<p>  This is not a partisan issue.  Both major parties are especially
inept when dealing with issues involving sex.<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a>
<p>  It is shocking that an individual could go to jail
for "obscene" photos not involving children.            

<p>The emotional appeal of those decrying the ill effects of obscene speech becomes redundant and
ultimately serves to limit constitutional guarantees.  Very few people are actually in favor of
obscenity, whatever they think it is might be in their mind, so protecting obscene speech is not
high on the political agenda for most politicians.  In the past, community standards worked to a
certain degree.  However, because of the burgeoning Internet culture, Congress will inevitably
need to overhaul the entire definition as it pertains to obscenity.  It should use the 'virtual
community" standard test if the language of <em>Miller</em> is still to be utilized.  What would constitute
the community is what would change.  Once this overhaul occurs, the society as a whole will
receive increased protection from unwarranted government intrusion.  Of course, there is always
the risk that Congress would further erode the Constitution if it were to move on this issue. 

<p>Nevertheless, because obscenity is based on community standards, what is obscene in one
jurisdiction would be permissible in another.  Because <em>Miller </em>encourages this splintering effect,
users are overly burdened by remote communities that are not active  parts of the Internet culture
in question.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a>
<p>  

<p>It is politically expedient to wave the banner of decency.  It is like apple pie, baseball and Sunday
school.  Who could be against it?  What kind of devil is not for a clean environment, ending
homelessness and peace on earth.  Society, and in particular the government, should not suspend
the Constitution in the name of protecting children.  Punishing adults for exercising their
constitutional rights will not make up for the harm suffered by children at the hands of child
pornographers. The correlation between Socrates' situation and the modern day obscenity
defendant is striking. While it is clear that the filth which Mr. and Mrs. Thomas purveyed was
not close to the intellectual "filth" Socrates espoused, the intolerance today is far more
reprehensible today than in 399 B.C.<a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>
<p> There seems to be a latent element of frustration and
tension that exists between those who are free spiritually and those who are cloistered and living
in the fear of absolute punishment. The so called "moral majority" have a deep longing to destroy
and punish the heretic, not unlike Mrs. Prynne, in the <em>Scarlet Letter</em>.<a href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a>
<p>   On confession
Hawthorne wrote, "We must not always talk in the market-place of what happens to us in the
forest."<a href="#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a>
<p>   Their illicit affair was obscene in the community which they lived, yet there conduct
was innocent.  Hawthorne's protagonists were struggling with the need to feel guilt for
something that one need feel no shame.  Though sexual expression offended the prevailing
"reasonable person" standards of the community in which they lived, neither he nor Hester
Prynne felt the shame they were required to feel.<sup> </sup><a href="#N_107_"><sup>(107)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The shame Hester felt was for the community because of its unchristian, judgmental and
hypocritical reaction to what in their eyes was obscene sexual behavior.  The common reaction to
Hawthorne's work is repulsion at how the community mistreated Hester Prynne.  In terms of
hypocrisy have things really changed much since the 1600's? 

<p>The modern left and right merge in a hybrid partnership of paternity concerning the issue of
obscenity regulation.  These groups put much of their political strength in regulating what free
women see and hear.  Why do these individuals fail to practice the American ideal of tolerance in
their own lives. These proponents of regulation use the government as their vehicle.<a href="#N_108_"><sup>(108)</sup></a>  The
government becomes a vehicle of moral imposition.    The most eloquent response to the alleged
piety of these individuals is best described in a retort by Socrates to the swollen headed of his
generation:

<p>Well I am certainly wiser than this man. It is only too likely that neither of us has any knowledge
to boast of; but he thinks that he knows something which he does not know, whereas I am quite
conscious of my ignorance.  At any rate it seems that I am wiser than he is to this small extent,
that I do not think that I know what I do not know. "<a href="#N_109_"><sup>(109)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>Catharine MacKinnon advocates censoring pornography<a href="#N_110_"><sup>(110)</sup></a>
<p> while others suggest the Internet
should be treated like a printing press.<a href="#N_111_"><sup>(111)</sup></a>
<p>  The Supreme Court has avoided its responsibility to
provide adequate guidance to help secure some uniformity by creating a national standard for
obscenity to be applied equally in all cases.  The disparate outcome in cases like <em>Thomas
</em>demonstrates why regulation must be changed, or else all Americans will eventually suffer by
loss of proportional relative freedom.<a href="#N_112_"><sup>(112)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Today, a national standard exists on the Internet created by the less than tolerant elements of
American culture. Politics make strange bed fellows.  Regarding the issue of political power
Plato in the <em>Republic </em>quoted Socrates as having said: 

<p>Until  philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of
philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who
pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities [states] will never
have rest from their evils--no, nor the human race.<a href="#N_113_"><sup>(113)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Politicians today are further from philosophers and closer to warped caricatures of snake oil
salesman.  No rhetoric could describe adequately the betrayal of our constitutional rights by
"elected" politicians.

<p>In the preface to the special 1984 commemorative edition of  George Orwell's <em>1984, </em>Walter
Cronkite made one of the most insightful comments on the state of changing political culture. 
Cronkite wrote:

<p><em>1984</em> is an anguished lament and a warning that we may not be strong enough nor wise enough
nor moral enough to cope with the kind of power we have learned to amass.  That warning
vibrates powerfully when we allow ourselves to sit still and think carefully about orbiting
satellites that can read the license plates in a parking lot and computers that can tap into
thousands of  telephone calls and telex transmissions at once and other computers that can do our
banking and purchasing.And we hear echoes of that warning chord in the constant demand for
greater security and comfort, for less risk in our societies.  We recognize, however dimly, that
greater efficiency, ease, and security may come at a substantial price in freedom, the law and
order can be a doublethink version of oppression, that individual liberties surrendered for
whatever good reason are freedom lost.  Still, the warning has been effective; and every time we
use one of those catch  phrasesrecognize Big Brother is someone, see a 1984 in our
futurenotice something Orwellianwe are listening to that warning again.<a href="#N_114_"><sup>(114)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This echo is gaining more resonance with time. The government authorizes and implements
policies fostering the legal victimization of drug users, gays and lesbians, women, people of
color, trade union activists, civil libertarians, the uneducated non-favored male majority and
other non-dominant sexual, social, political or religious non-majorities. Does this sound like
<em>1984</em>, or has society just grown so desensitized it can not react to the vice grip being applied by
the dominant political elite?  Freedom is a luxury and the Constitution is a technicality.  The
debate is about having your voice, your art, and your sexuality not declared illegal.  It is about
expanding the capacities of the human being, not restricting them. 

<p>Some conduct based speech is very unpopular.  When women burned their bras this was a protest
against the established male patriarch.  When gang members wear their colors this should be a
protected form of expression, though it be more than pure speech.  Notice the natural tendency to
recoil when such ideas are introduced.  To this day many people are offended by unpopular forms
of rebellious expression.  Instead of judging these activists, look at the message they speak.  The
message could be vile, but it is real and one must understand it exists.  In other words, society
can not wish the obscene expression away by legislating it out of existence.  Gang members will
be gang members with or without colors. For example, should sign language be only allowed for
deaf non-gang members?  Regulation of such things is ridiculous, as in the case of obscenity. 
When did America become so comfortable with its intolerant composition, so comfortable with
its newly found piety? 

<p>Of course, any person that reaches a level of tolerance to be able to accept others different than
herself is capable of avoiding sites on the World Wide Web that might be offensive. Because
some are unwilling to turn the channel all are at risk of losing freedom. Others believe that the
loss of freedom will not impact on them directly.  This is probably true if their preferences are
left untouched by censorship.         

<p>Why can the people of Tennessee not avoid questionable sites if they are so offended by its
content?  Obviously they could, but rather the problem is with politicians who want to make
points with voters by getting tough on indecent people, as if they have a monopoly on chastity. 
Some well intentioned politicians left, right and center unwittingly betrayed the people and the
Constitution by working to restrict the freedom of speech for whatever noble purpose they may
have been inspired.

<p>The force of inertia propels our forefathers' bigotry and sexual repression into our own lives. 
Relating back to good intentions, politics and the laws of our ancestors Thomas Jefferson wrote:

<p>Yet our lawyers and priests generally inculcate this doctrine, and suppose that preceding
generations held the earth more freely than we do; had a right to impose laws on us, unalterable
by ourselves, and that we, in like manner, can make laws and impose burdens on future
generations, which they will have no right to alter; in fine, that the earth belongs to the dead and
not the living.<a href="#N_115_"><sup>(115)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>Few politicians thrive if they stand up for the rights of people like Mr. and Mrs. Thomas.  Recall
Socrates' discussion on  how lonely it is to stand for things not popular with the majority.  Once
again, why can a few puritanicals dictate criminal norms to the secular society at large? Why do
the rights of people in Tennessee trump the rights of those in California?  In essence, the most
liberal jurisdictions, as well as the most conservative jurisdictions will control what providers
can and cannot put on the Internet. One must be careful when discussing obscenity because the
examples used to demonstrate the fine line might be construed as obscene.  This is the unreality
of the whole debate.  There is no other issue at law which is so subjective as obscenity.  It would
be helpful in terms of honest and open analysis if "obscene" images and utterances could be
disseminated for discussion to demonstrate the subjective nature of analysis that obscenity
analysis engenders in practice.

<p>Does morality really matter?  Socrates said, "A system of morality which is based on relative
emotional values is a mere illusion, a thoroughly vulgar conception which has nothing sound in it
and nothing true". <a href="#N_116_"><sup>(116)</sup></a>
<p>  It is not that Socrates was morally indifferent, it was that the level of
hypocrisy he faced made him speak out to show the obvious contradictions he was presented
with during his twilight years.  

<p>Plato's <em>Apology</em> summarizes the importance of individual choice and intellectual freedom: 

<p>If I tell you that I would be disobeying the god and If I tell you that I would be disobeying the god
and on that account it is impossible for me to keep quiet, you won't be persuaded by me, taking it
that I am ironizing.  And if I tell you that it is the greatest good for a human being to have
discussions every day about virtue and other things you hear me talking about, examining myself
and others, and that the unexamined life is not livable for a human being, you will be even less
persuaded.<a href="#N_117_"><sup>(117)</sup></a>
<p> 

<p>The Internet represents many things about us as a nation.  Either we will accept the difference of
others, or we will try to regulate those who hold different and sometimes disgusting views.  The
net result is always the same when we trade liberty for security.

guilty of obscenity charges more easily if it is found that the dissemination was for monetary
gain.  This result is not surprising since the Court feels a duty to save the public from its own
desire for cybersmut, as well as traditional forms of  obscenity such as poetry and performance
art.

<p><a name="N_43_">43. </a><em>See id.</em> The text of the statute makes no attempt to define what passes legal muster for
obscenity.  The thrust of this law is not to prohibit legal conversations between adults and
minors.  It was designed to criminalize the dissemination of pornography and obscenity to
children.  This only becomes relevant in cases where the adult conveys literary information that
some find offensive or classical works of art that include nudity.  Something can be obscene
without necessarily possessing the qualities associated with pornography.  Just as not all child
pornography is necessarily obscene legally.

"There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and
punishment of which have never been though to raise any Constitutional problem.  These include
the lewd and obscene." ; <em>see also</em> Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250, 266 (1952). Here the
Court wrote, "Certainly no one would contend that obscene speech, for example, may be
punished only upon a showing of a clear and present danger."   This is exactly what many are
proposing be done by requiring a showing of actual damages or at least a clear and present
danger before a remedy could be sought in the form of an injunction or damages.

test is a superior analysis under the Constitution because it at least moves away from the most
susceptible standard.

Constitution, as well as the Court.

of the specific purposes of this section is to overrule Stratton-Oakmont v. Prodigy and any other
similar decisions which have treated such providers and users as publishers or speakers of
content that is not their own because they have restricted access to objectionable material.  The
conferees believe that such decisions create serious obstacles to the important federal policy of
empowering parents to determine the content of communications their children receive through
interactive computer services."  Simply, vicarious liability shall not be imputed to service

made in the Constitution.  This is even more true in light of the potential threat to the Stanley
exception's place in the obscenity debate.  Stanley solidifies this right to privacy.  In fact the
court said the right to possess obscenity does not rest on the freedom of speech but rather on a
separate portion of the Constitution.

<p>In the late 1960's a television show that was destined to change the face of Science Fiction
opened the door of people's imagination to what the future might look like.  But not even the
early episodes of Star Trek<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> could have predicted the explosion of information that the Internet
has made available to every person with a computer and a modem.  And all of this has occurred
in the last gasp of breath of this decade, indeed of this millennia.  The "Internet", "Cyberspace",
the "Web", and the "Information Superhighway" have all become household words in just a few
years.  Today, a user<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> can sit down at his/her computer in Lubbock, Texas, and carry on a real
time conversation with people as close as next door to as far away as Australia or China.  The
Internet, which is literally a web of smaller networks, can connect a user locally, nationally, or
even globally.  People can "log on" for fun, for research, or for business purposes.  Through the
use of Electronic Bulletin Boards (BBS) and "chat rooms" a user can post a message for anyone
in the world to read, or can limit that message to those who have access to a particular BBS or
chat room.

<p>Just two hundred years ago the swiftest means of sending a message was by horseback.  That had
been the fastest form of communication, aside from smoke signals for thousands of years.  The
past two centuries have seen the advent of the telegraph, the telephone, broadcast radio signals,
then satellite communications, and now the full access to the world that the Internet allows.  Each
of these advancements has raised new and novel legal questions.  Society has struggled with the
legal consequences of each new technological advance.  Through the struggle some very creative
answers have arisen over the years.  Today our society is presented with a whole host of novel
legal questions by the use of the Internet.  These new questions challenge societies ability to
answer the question with even more creative answers than have been seen in the past.

<p>   To first approach these new issues, the courts must determine if they even have jurisdiction to
hear the case, and if so, what law should be applied to that case.  The second determination is the
choice-of-law question.  While this determination is the same question that has been asked for
many years in other types of cases, the underlying facts of the Internet dispute are completely
different from anything the courts have faced in the past.

<p>No law has been developed that can control or govern the Internet.  The question of what law to
apply to an Internet based legal issue, the choice of law question, will be addressed in this article. 
The reason this is such a difficult question for the courts to answer is because, until now, choice
of law doctrine has been based on geographical locations, principles tied to land, territories, and
borders.  The Internet is in effect a web of webs that exists in domains, hosts, and networks,<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> all
of which are foreign to the geographically based concepts that form our modern law.  It is
virtually impossible to tie the Internet down by drawing lines on a map.

<p>At this point it should be noted that this article is limited in scope to discussing the Choice of
Law issues.  Therefore it will be assumed that both subject matter jurisdiction and personal
jurisdiction have been established and are not an issue.  Jurisdiction merely establishes whether
or not a particular court can hear a case before it.  Once it is established that a particular court can
hear a case, the court must determine what law is applicable to the action before it.  For example,
if a California resident were to post some derogatory comments on a BBS stationed on a server in
New Mexico about a resident of Texas.  The Texan could probably file suit against the
Californian in Texas, California, or perhaps even New Mexico, but whatever court hears the case
will not necessarily be applying its own state laws because it is unclear where, geographically
speaking, the "harm" took place, although it is clear that at least either the Texas or the
Californian courts could hear the case.  Therefore the rest of the article will discuss the choice of
law issues.

<p>In addressing the choice of law issues this paper will first examine the current state of the law. 
Then follows an analysis of several suggested solutions to the current problems.  These solutions
range from contract solutions to adopting a new international law, based on Admiralty Law or on
the ancient Merchant Law, and concluding with a self-governing model.  Finally, the article will
end with a forecast of an incremental progression to a new form of international law.

<a name="tech2"><p align="center">II. Current State of The Law</a>

<p>In order to look to the future, we must know where we currently stand with respect to the current
legal standard.  We must analyze the current state of the law in order to predict where the future
might take us.  Anytime a tort occurs on the Internet, where the parties involved are not in the
same jurisdiction, the court where the suit is filed must try to find what law to apply.  Of course
the answer is simple where all parties reside within the same jurisdiction or even if the laws of
the different jurisdictions are substantially similar.  The problem arises where a person of one
jurisdiction desires to sue a party in a completely different jurisdiction, particularly one that is
outside the territorial influence of the suing party's judicial district.  For example, if a citizen of
Texas wished to sue a citizen of Chile, whose law would apply?  Currently no multinational
agreement exists that can tell us what the choice-of-law will be for torts that occur in Cyberspace. 
Courts therefore are applying, as best they can, "traditional" choice of law doctrines.  Those
traditional doctrines include the <em>lex loci delicti</em> approach from the First Restatement of Conflict
of Laws and the "most significant relationship" approach from the Second Restatement of
Conflict of Laws.  However, as David Post observed in his October article in <em>The American
Lawyer</em>, "we no longer strictly apply the law of 'the place' where an event or transaction takes
place - - remember <em>lex locus delicti</em> and <em>lex locus contractu</em>? - - but look increasingly to where
the effects of those events are felt for the source of applicable law."<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  

<p>A brief look at the <em>lex loci delicti</em> doctrine will help to serve our understanding of why the
traditional models are no longer working, at least in regard to cyber-torts.  The <em>lex loci delicti</em>
doctrine applies the law of the place where the wrong took place.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  The "place of the wrong" is
generally the place where the last event necessary to make a party liable for the tort takes place.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> 
With a cyber-tort the difficulty lies in trying to ascertain, geographically speaking, where exactly
that last event occurred.  Because the Internet exists across jurisdictional boundaries, there is no
one particular geographical place that can be pinpointed as being the place where the last event
occurred.  With the publication of a magazine, a somewhat similar problem exists.  The tort
occurs when a person reads a slanderous comment, but the magazine, at least in theory, is read
simultaneously all across the nation.  In <em>Keeton v. Hustler Magazine</em>, the Supreme Court allowed
a local court to apply its state's law to a nationwide libel.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>  The court reasoned that because the
location was in effect everywhere, the state court should be able to apply its own law.  Because a
tort in Cyberspace occurs everywhere simultaneously, a court could reason that it could apply its
own state law every time.  However, if the state court were allowed to always apply its own laws,
this would clearly encourage forum shopping.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>  Forum Shopping, as a matter of public policy, is
generally discouraged.  If Forum Shopping is allowed or permitted, then one particular area
might start to "cater" their laws in favor of service providers.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>  Therefore, the laws of that
particular district would be more "relaxed" than the laws of the rest of the country.  This would
be unfair for the average consumer who would expect the law of the area where he is to be, at
least substantially similar, to the law that will be applied in any suit initiated by him.  

<p>Next, we look to the Second Restatement's "most significant relationship" test.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  This test
allows for the consideration of a variety of contacts.  Among them is the place of the injury, the
place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, the place of domicile or residence of the
parties, and the place where the parties' relationship is centered.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>  These contacts are all tied to a
geographical location, however the Internet exists in a non-geographical environment.  While the
Second Restatement's relationship test is more flexible than the First Restatement's location of
the last event test, the contacts listed for consideration by the Second Restatement are all tied to a
"place", similar to the test in the First Restatement.  Therefore, neither the First Restatement nor
the Second Restatement can answer the question of which law to apply.  

<p>The traditional models of choice of law doctrine are all tied to land, to place, to some
geographical location.  In Cyberspace one can send a message to any physical location in any
physical jurisdiction without any distance-based degradation or delay.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  Traveling or "surfing"
the Internet, a user does not get cues that they have crossed a national border, or some other
geographical line on a map.  The Internet "enables simultaneous transactions between large
numbers of people who do not know, and in many cases cannot know, the physical location of
the other party."<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>  In Cyberspace one is nowhere and everywhere all at the same time.  Because
of these characteristics the traditional choice of law doctrines fall short of answering the question
of what law to apply.  Existing Doctrines fall short because they are all tied to land and
geographical locations while Cyberspace is not tied to a geographical location.

<p>One typical cyber-tort is defamation.  "Defamation is that which tends to injure reputation; to
diminish the esteem, respect, goodwill or confidence in which the plaintiff is held, or to excite
adverse derogatory or unpleasant feelings or opinions against him."<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  In other words,
defamation is saying something false about someone that makes that person look bad.  This can
occur through any number of forums on the Internet.  A person could post a message on a BBS,
send an e-mail message to someone else, or even just post a note on a "homepage" that ultimately
defames another person.  

<p>Other examples of cyber-torts would be hate speech and threats.  For a look at what some would
describe as that sort of conduct, one could view the Aryan Nation's Homepage, or the homepage
of the Ku Klux Klan.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>  In Canada, it is illegal to circulate racially offensive literature, in the
United States that same speech probably would be protected by the First Amendment.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> 
However, a Canadian citizen sitting at a computer in Toronto, Canada could very easily access
such material which is legally located and operated on a server in the United States, whether or
not a tort has occurred will depend on whether Canadian or U. S. law will apply.

<p>There are also the cases of business cyber-torts where one business invades the files of another
business via the Internet, or where one business tampers with the files of another company. 
However, there are national laws and international treaties against such actions and, furthermore,
big businesses are better able to protect themselves than can an individual.  For these reasons,
this paper will focus on the more personal ramifications of choice-of-law and Cyberspace.

<p>Helen Shin noted three consequences of the absence of a coherent choice of law doctrine.  First,
inconsistent application of the law and inconsistent results encourage forum shopping.  Second
there is a diminished predictability of result because of the difficulty in ascertaining what law
will apply.  Third, because of the uncertainty as to the applicable law, and the reduced deterrence
of no set policy, individuals are forced take risks.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>

<a name="tech3"><p align="center">III.  Resolution By Contract</a><P>
The future may hold solutions that can help resolve the choice-of-law dilemma.  One solution
may be found in Contract law.  Both individuals and companies can contract for the choice of
law and the choice of forum in their cyber-transactions.  In any sales or service agreement, the
parties involved can circumvent the dilemma that the courts are facing with Choice of Law
Doctrine by simply deciding amongst themselves what law they want to apply.  Generally, the
decision that the parties arrive at will be enforced, so long as that agreement does not conflict
with the basic underlying policies of the forum state.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>  Therefore, a court would not enforce a
choice of law clause that would make it legal to do something that would be illegal within that
forum state.  

<p>On the user side, the user's contract with a service provider<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a> could incorporate a choice- of-law
clause.  Therefore, any dispute the user had with the service provider would be controlled by the
choice of law clause designated in the contract.  Matthew Bernstein proposed that the service
providers may contract amongst themselves for choice of law clauses.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>  If this were the case
then, if a customer of service A wanted to sue a customer of service B, the choice of law clause
between service provider A and service provider B would control which law to apply.  

<p>An article by Gary Moore and David Hamden, proposes application of an on-line version of the
"shrinkwrap" license to resolve the choice of law issue.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>  Their proposed model would have on-line service providers direct anyone seeking to access their service through a series of screens
that would present the user with certain choices.  Ultimately the user would have to affirmatively
agree to a choice of law clause presented on one of the "pages".  Of course there would have to
be a "reasonable basis for the parties choice, and application of the chosen law could not violate a
fundamental policy of the state whose law would otherwise be applicable and has a materially
greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue."<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>  Both Moore
and Hamden recognize that if the site of the provider's server becomes a critical question, then
the provider would be inclined to put their server in a forum with more favorable laws than that
of the provider's principal place of business.  In other words, this program could lead to forum
shopping.

<p>Raymond Nimmer noted that "[f]or consumer contracts, the law hinges validation on whether the
choice deprives the consumer of protection that would be applicable in the country in which the
consumer resides.  Absent a contractual choice of law, the applicable law is the country in which
the consumer is habitually a resident."<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>  Of course the courts will look at the bargaining
position of each party to determine if the contract was too one-sided.  It is an important point to
note that the user could always choose to move to another service provider if they did not like the
contract terms supplied by the first service provider.  In effect there is genuine negotiation
between the user and the provider because the user does have a choice of which provider with
whom they would like to contract.  As long as there are numerous service providers, this choice
remains guarantied. 

<p>Matthew Bernstein summed up the utility of choice of law clauses very well when he stated,
"Forum selection clauses can bring order and stability to cyberspatial contracts by substituting the
highly-developed real-space legal order for the uncertain and almost haphazard regime likely to
result if courts are left to choose law in cyber-disputes."<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>  This section clearly emphasizes to the
user as well as to the provider the utility of using forum selection and choice of law clauses. 
Although a forum selection clause, or a choice of law clause, does not guarantee that in all
circumstances the courts will not have to address choice of law issues, they do provide stability
of result in most cases.  The true problem is that not all situations can be covered by choice of
law clauses.  Even if the parties do enter into a contract that sets the choice of law by a provision
in the contract, a dispute still might arise over the choice of law provision or some other area of
the contract that might fall outside the choice of law provision.  If such a conflict arises, then we
find ourselves right back where we started, with no discernible international standard for choice
of law disputes.  

<a name="tech4"><p align="center">IV.  A New Multinational Law Based on Admiralty Law</a><P>
Eventually there will have to be some sort of international accord on choice of law issues.  But if
such an accord is to be developed, what will it look like?  What kind of provisions will get the
support of all nations?  Few nations will be willing to sacrifice part of their sovereignty over the
communication medium of the future.  In looking to the past for a model, some authors have
recommended the adoption of an international cyber-law that would be patterned after modern
maritime law, or admiralty law.  The model would have to be one that has been generally
accepted by most nations, such as admiralty law.  The model would have to be non-geographically based, such as admiralty law.  If two ships were to collide in the middle of the
ocean, there is no particular point of land that can be pointed to as being the "place" of the
accident.  The seas are not divided up with lines drawn to show whose part of the ocean anyone
is on at any particular time.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>  In fact, there are many similarities, in a purely legal sense,
between a dispute following two ships colliding and the dispute that two Internet users might
develop.  Matthew Bernstein has explored the option of an international cyber-law based on
maritime law in his note, "Conflicts on the Net."<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>  The first step is to determine whether or not
the dispute is truly related to the Internet.  This would be determined much the same way as
whether or not an issue is truly a maritime issue.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>  Provided that the dispute has the
characteristics of a cyber-law issue, then the international cyber-law would be applied to resolve
the dispute.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>

<p>On a conceptual level, many similarities can be drawn between the oceans and Cyberspace.  Both
are areas that are not controlled by any particular government.  Both are areas that are beyond the
control of any particular government.  Both are areas in which people of completely different
nations might "run into each other," or develop a legal dispute.  

<p>In admiralty law, much deference is paid to the flag that the ship flies.  A ship normally flies the
flag of the nation where it is registered.  For example, the Norwegian Cruise Line (N.C.L.) has all
of their cruise ships registered in Oslo, Norway.  Therefore, if a N.C.L. cruise ship were to have
an accident at sea with another ship from Norway, Norwegian law would apply despite the fact
the N.C.L. cruise ships are operated out of U.S. ports and that the hypothetical accident occurred
in the Gulf of Mexico, many miles from Oslo.  In the same manner, Cyberspace users could carry
the "flag" of the jurisdiction where their server is located.  For example, a user in Oklahoma that
logs onto the Net via a server in Texas would "fly" a Texas flag.  Therefore, the same principles
of choice of law in Admiralty would apply to choice of law in Cyberspace.

<p align="center"><a name="tech5">V.  A New Multinational Law Based on The Law of Sovereignness Regions</a><p>
Cyberspace is not the only "place" where the potential exists for legal disputes to arise with no
discernible law to help decide those disputes.  One could envision, in the not so distant future, a
civil tort being committed between two people of different nationalities on a space station that is
orbiting the Earth.  If the space station was a multinational "joint effort", whose law would apply
to that tort?  If the station was built with funds from several countries, do each of these countries
get to apply their laws to life on the station?  Of course, there are those that could make a lawyer
joke out of these questions, but it is an interesting prospect, space-law, the new frontier.  Of
course, eventually space could be divided and partitioned into "places" that would fit the modern
choice of law theories.  However, for the time being, space is not "claimed" by any particular
nation, and all current indicia is that it will take a multinational effort for the people of Earth to
move into the stars.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>

<p>The same questions can be asked about a much more foreseeable tort between two people of
different nationalities who happen to be exploring Antarctica.  Although unlike cyber-space,
Antarctica is a geographical location.  However, like Cyberspace, there still is no law of the
domain to apply.  Antarctica does not have its own governing body nor its own set of laws, nor
for that matter its own permanent population.  The treaties that govern public international law
issues, do not govern torts or contract disputes.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>  So, in effect, this geographical area is without
any geographically based laws to apply.  Therefore Antarctica and Cyberspace do have a lot in
common in terms of the choice-of-law issue. 

<p>Jonathon Blum noted that in suits brought over torts occurring in Antarctica, the courts have
applied the law of the jurisdiction where the suit was filed.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>  For example, an Air New Zealand
airplane that crashed in Antarctica spawned a lawsuit that was filed in a Washington D.C.,
district court.  The D.C. Circuit Court held that because there was no alternate legal system to
choose from, because Antarctica has no legal system, the law to be applied would be the law of
the district where the suit was filed.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>

<p>The problems facing Antarctica-law are the same that face Cyber-law.  Mr. Blum suggests that,
the nations that were party to the Antarctic Treaty should create a new law to resolve Antarctica's
choice of law problem.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>  Unfortunately, in Antarctica, just as in Cyberspace, no country wants
to give up its sovereignty.  However, Cyberlaw is much more immediate than Antarctica. 
Interest and use of Cyberspace is increasing daily.  Legal issues that confront Cyberspace today
will only grow larger with time.  Antarctica on the other hand can afford to remain fairly obscure. 
Nevertheless, there are international treaties dealing with some of Antarctica's governance issues,
so it would not be an altogether new process for the nations to enact similar policies in
Cyberspace.  Of course, unlike the present Antarctica treaties, the treaties dealing with
Cyberspace should contain a choice of law clause.  After all, without a choice of law clause, the
purpose of the treaty would remain dubious.

<a name="tech6"><p align="center">VI.  A New Multinational Law Based on The "Law Merchant"<P></a>

<p>Matthew Bernstein suggests another possible basis for a new multinational law based on the
medieval <em>lex mercatoria</em>, the Law Merchant.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>

<p> "The Law Merchant was a collection of customary practices among traveling merchants in
Medieval Europe and Asia that was enforceable in 'all the commercial countries of the civilized
word.'  The Law Merchant existed 'in some sense apart from and in addition to the ordinary rules
of law that applied to non-merchant transactions."<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>

<p>The Law Merchant is really little more than the shared legal understandings of the countries
involved.  Much of the same thing could exist in Cyberspace.  Over time, as each country begins
to experience the problems that can develop through Internet use, they will develop some
common understandings.  These "understandings" would become similar to the American term
"Industry Standard."<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>  Eventually, these understandings could present the basis for a new
multinational law.  Unfortunately, it will be many years until such understandings can become
the global standard.  The Internet has questions that need to be answered now, not in the distant
future.  Until the Law Merchant can become the "Law Cyberspace", choice of law issues will still
remain.  Nevertheless, the concept for which the Law Merchant stands could be very useful for
the Internet users and service providers as the Internet continues to develop its own standards,
rules, and procedures.  This theme of the Internet developing its own rules will be addressed infra
in this article under the Self-Governing Section.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>

<a name="tech7"><p align="center">VII.  	A Multinational Accord</a><P>

<p>An alternative to the formation of a new international set of laws is for countries to enter into a
treaty that establishes a set rule for choice-of-law issues.  This would require that the
participating countries adopt a choice of law clause in a multinational treaty.  This treaty, or
international accord, would not be unprecedented.  For example, the international community has
created an accord regarding the applicable law to a traffic accident among nationals of different
countries.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>  This accord on traffic accidents could lay a clear precedent for modern nations to
follow in their efforts to develop a new multinational accord for choice-of-law issues on the
Internet.  Inevitably, the future will see "[e]xisting sovereigns enter[ing] into international
agreements to establish new and uniform rules specifically applicable to conduct on the Net."<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>
The first step to those uniform rules is to establish an international choice of law doctrine.

<p>The concern that some sovereigns might have over giving up some of their control over the
Internet would be compensated for by the increased certainty that citizens would experience
when taking an on-ramp to the Information Superhighway.   Internet users would know that their
transactions are protected under a stable, proscribed set of laws.  They would be comfortable that
they would have a method for redress even when dealing with an Internet user located in a
foreign country.  Clearly, the loss of sovereignty would be much less in an multinational accord
than with the establishment of an international set of rules and laws governed by some sort of
"new international organization (along the lines of the World Trade Organization)", an
alternative that David Post has suggested.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>  Nations around the world have come together on a
variety of issues ranging from the treatment of prisoners of war to how to determine the status of
an alien.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>  The Internet stretches across every nation on Earth.  Every nation has some sort of
interest in how the Internet is to be governed.  The United Nations should call for an international
summit to be held to identify the problems and to propose at least certain minimal solutions.  The
first step would be to establish Choice-of-Law doctrines that would not infringe too far into any
nation's sovereignty, while still meeting the goals of predictability and stability in legal dealings
on the Internet.  Ultimately, someone will be treated unfairly, but this is a fact of life and
although lawmakers cannot make the world perfect, they can lay down the ground rules that
would establish a fair playing field.

<a name="tech8"><p align="center">VIII.	  A Self-Governing Model</a><P>

<p>One of the reasons the Founding Fathers had for establishing the United State was because the
British Colonists wanted to be able to govern themselves.  In establishing their new form of
government, these new Americans elected to have a republic style of government that relied on
the people being able to vote and send their representatives to make the laws that would control
the people's lives.  In the beginning there was a great deal of anarchy.  No one really knew how
this new system was going to work, or if it even was going to work.  Certain analogies can be
drawn between the legal questions that the early colonialist faced to the legal questions that the
Internet colonist faces today.  How does this system work?  Who really controls what happens on
the Internet?  The answer is simple, the answer is that we the people control the Internet.  In the
beginning of this nation the "we the people" only numbered in the thousands, while the "we the
people" of the Internet number in the tens of millions.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>  The issues are more complicated simply
because of the broader interests at work in Cyberspace.  But the ultimate conclusion is that "we
the people" are the ones in control of the Internet.  

<p>This line of thought would lead to a conclusion that Cyberspace can control itself, it can dictate
its own laws, not by the force a multinational treaty, but by the economic factors that drive the
global economy; by the same spirit of cooperation that helped to found the United States of
America in the first place.  But to understand how this might occur, we must first look at what
makes up the Internet.  On the base level is the common user.  A person who accesses the
Internet for fun, business, or even curiosity.  This is the largest level on the Internet.  This is the
level that can control the basic functioning of the Internet by the use of the dollar.  The next level
is the service providers.  Someone has to have servers that allow users to access the Information
Superhighway.  It is here that the difference can be made.  Most of these service providers some
fee for the "privilege" of accessing the Internet through them.  There are a large number of
service providers that  range from educational institutions to commercial companies such as
America On-Line and Compuserve.  Finally, the top level are the information sources.  These
sources can be anything from an individual's homepage, to a complex information provider run
by some branch of the government, to a commercially run site that charges money for the user to
access the company's  information.  The key is the middle man, the service provider.  Without the
service provider, individuals could not make their way to the information providers.  This self-governing law must center on the service providers.

<p>As David Post noted, this would not be the first time that the service providers have had to unite
to make a major policy decision.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>  No one told the Internet community what communication
standards would exist.  Several volunteer groups got together and came up with some proposed
communication standards that eventually became the "law of the Net".<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>  The point is that these
communication standards were not set by some international treaty or accord.  There was no
International Internet Committee sanctioned to act on behalf of the nations of the world.  There
was simply the individual system administrators who voluntarily adopted one particular set of
proposed rules.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>  While different internal networks may operate on a wide variety of different
communication standards, if any of them want to connect to the Internet, they must adopt the
communication standards that have become the "industry standard" for the Internet.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>  This type
of cooperation has set a precedent.  It has been proven that even such a diverse group as those
involved with the Internet can function on their own without any form of local or international
governmental influence.  This type of pioneering spirit is not unlike the drive that led the early
American colonist to step away from the government that they knew to establish their own type
of government based on "the people."  A type of government that would not and could not
function without the consent of the people.  

<p>The next step is to see if this self-governing process can move beyond the technical and scientific
to control the often unpredictable human social behavior.  To approach this stage, we must bear
in mind that the Internet is not tied to land and particular places like our federal form of
government.  Rather, the Internet exists only on a plane of Cyberspace, not set by geographical
limitations.  In Cyberspace, it is not the state governments that are the governing unit, but the
network administrators.  Citizens of Texas as well as citizens of New Jersey could find
themselves on the same service provider and therefore under the same network administrator
while remaining subject to two different geographically tied sets of laws. 

<p>Network administrators would be the ideal seat of governance power in the self-governing model
of Cyberspace.  It is the network administrators that set the policies under which access to their
service is provided.  The network administrator could set, as a corporate policy, that all disputes
that arise as a result of accessing the Internet via their servers must go to a form of arbitration. 
With such a policy in place, the user would not have to address the choice of law issues, unless
arbitration was contested for some reason, this being only a rare occurrence.  Under this system,
the network administrator would become the "law-giver" for those that choose to utilize that
service.

<p>Because there are numerous service providers out there, it can be assumed that the network
administrator at each service provider would set their own rules regarding use of their service,
and despite some overlapping, there would be some real material differences in the rules
governing their individual service provider contracts.  With a variety of servers to choose from,
the user would be able to "vote" for the service of their choice based in part on the rules that the
Internet provider imposed on the user.  For example, it is foreseeable that a parent of a young
child might select the Internet provider that bans access to all information that might be
characterized as "adult" or "violent" in nature.  Some providers could offer anonymous use, while
others would identify the user.  Some providers could allow "junk e-mailings",<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a> while other
providers would prohibit such "mass e-mailings".  The user would be able to select those options 
most important to their needs, then choose the Internet provider that best meets that criteria.  In
effect, the user would be declaring their "cyber-nationality" by selecting the particular Internet
provider.  In the end, a citizen of Quebec, Canada, could belong to the same "cyber-nationality"
as a citizen of Texas.  For any Internet disputes, the choice-of-law would be that which is set out
by the Internet provider of choice.

<p>Ultimately, as David Post noted, this type of "cyber-nationality" could lead to the formation of
"multiple network confederations."<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>  This would carry out the concept of a self-governing
Internet because the stronger confederations would be able to control some of the worst material
that might otherwise make its way onto the Information Superhighway.  The confederations
might also set up dispute resolution services, such as arbitration,  for their customers as well as
set the choice of law by contract.  

<p>The only way that self-governance will come about is if the Internet service providers start to
recognize the potential that awaits them.  In the face of an international community that is
unwilling to risk giving up individual control over the communication medium of the next
century, the private sector must react.  The future of the Internet is still very uncertain, but
through the use of contract clauses that select choice of law and choice of forum, and that make
arbitration the primary dispute resolution scheme, service  providers could open wide a door
which is not yet fully released because of the legal uncertainties that await an Internet user.

<a name="tech9"><p align="center">IX.	  Arbitration As An Answer to Choice Of Law</a><P>

Throughout this article arbitration has been referred to as an option or an accessory to deciding
the choice of law issues.  In reality, arbitration is, and will be even more so, a very useful tool for
the modern citizen and company.  Arbitration is a non-judicial form of dispute resolution, the
parties do not have to appear before a judge.  In arbitration, the two parties will meet and present
their arguments before an impartial arbitrator.  Then the parties will try to work out a settlement
that is mutually agreeable.  If the parties can reach the settlement agreement on their own then
there is no need for the arbitrator, except as an arbitrator of the discussion.  The agreed upon
settlement is then drafted up into a contract form.  Both parties sign the contract and then the
contract becomes the equivalent of a court ruling.  A violation of the settlement contract would
be treated as a breach of a contract.

<p>If the parties are unable to reach a settlement on their own, the arbitrator can decide the case for
the parties.  The arbitrator's decision is final.  If either one of the parties wish to appeal the
arbitrator's findings, then that party is free to file suit in a regular judicial court; of course, choice
of law then becomes an issue.  If the parties agree to the arbitrator's decision, then the decision is
drafted into a contract that each party signs.  

<p>The chief advantage of arbitration is that it is generally quicker than the normal judicial process. 
Arbitration allows for an arbitrator who specializes in the area of a particular dispute, as opposed
to the average judge, who although highly educated, is generally not a specialist in particular
areas of law.  Arbitration is generally less expensive than going to court, because there are fewer
lawyer hours involved, no court costs and less money spent on preparation for trial.  Of particular
interest to this article, arbitration allows the parties to circumvent any particular set of laws,
thereby circumventing the entire choice of law issue.

<p>David Post introduced cyber-arbitration in a recent article in <em>The American Lawyer</em>.<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>  Under
Post's model, the cyber-arbitration is set up over the Internet, the two parties do not even have to
ever meet face-to-face.  The parties present their respective sides to a mediator via the Internet. 
This cyber-arbitration model involves an on-line arbitration system set up by the Cyberspace Law
Institute, the American Arbitration Association, Villanova Law School, and the National Center
for Automated Information Research.<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>  The entire proceedings only exist in Cyberspace.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a> 
This method presents a new and interesting alternative to traditional arbitration, which is in and
of itself an alternative to a traditional judicial decision.

<p>One of the advantages of this cyber-arbitration is the amount of money that could be saved in
addressing a dispute between two parties that are half-way around the world from one another. 
This method eliminates travel expenses of parties and their attorneys.  The parties could find a
highly qualified mediator or arbitrator, and would only have to pay that person's fee, again no
travel expenses.

<p>Of course, as with all pros, some cons must also exist.  Strictly on-line discussion does not afford
either party the opportunity to evaluate the physical reaction of the other party.  One party can not
see the facial reactions of the other party.  Sometimes such nonverbal cues play an important role
in knowing when to settle and when to fight for more.  However, this drawback could be
reversed in the next couple of years through the use of video-teleconferencing.  Video-teleconferencing is the closest thing that a person could ask for without actually having to be at
the physical location of the other party.  

<p>While on-line dispute resolution has great potential, there are a number of uncertainties.  Just as
Cyberspace is a place without a geographical location, the cyber-arbitration is a courtroom type
of setting, but without the actual people there.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>  While there are some unanswered questions
regarding this medium of dispute resolution; cyber-arbitration and the "Virtual Magistrate" are
both going to play an important role in the future development of dispute resolution and the
Internet.

<a name="tech10"><p align="center">X.  Conclusion</a>

<p>The choice of law question is a difficult one to answer in the real world, and is even more
difficult with a jurisprudence that is tied to boundaries and borders.  The Internet defies being
classified and limited to real-space boundaries.  Trying to answer the choice of law question has
challenged our courts to find a new mind-set.  The courts are forced to leave the comfort of well
established principles and precedents and to venture out "where no court has gone before."<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a> 
Cyberspace challenges the world to somehow reconcile a geographical real-space with a
nongeographical cyber-space.  In venturing out into the unknown space of legalities and
Cyberspace, authors have suggested that an entire new set of international laws should be
developed based on admiralty law or the old <em>lex mercatoria</em>.  Other authors have argued that the
Internet will develop, on its own, a new type of self-governing federalism establishing a new set
of standards that would become the laws of the Internet.  Finally authors have recommended
courses of actions for companies and individuals to follow until the choice of law question can be
answered.  

<p>As we turn our eyes to the future, the next several years will produce a number of incremental
steps taken by both the courts and the individuals.  The use of forum selection clauses and choice
of law provisions should become commonplace.  The courts will keep this in check by
recognizing only those clauses that are reasonable.

<p>When disputes arise with no built-in choice of law clause, the parties will make increasing use of
arbitration both on-line and in-person.  Arbitration allows individuals to fill the gap in choice-of-law doctrine that currently exists in our modern courts system.  Eventually, after enough
arbitration agreements are reached and published on the Net, a type of common-law will develop
based on these arbitration agreements.  A common-law that will be based particularly on those
arbitration agreements that stand the test of judicial review.  A common law that would resemble,
in application, the American term, Industry Standard.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>

<p>As the Internet becomes more commonplace in day-to-day commercial transactions, the
international community will have to forge treaties.  These treaties will probably first recognize
the enforceability of Arbitration Agreements, then expand to actually establish a set of laws
much like those that exist in admiralty law.  Following these treaties, the international cyber-common- law will develop further to be based on international judicial decisions as well as
arbitration agreements. 

<p>Eventually, the individual nations may be forced to give up their sovereignty over Cyberspace to
some new international body.  The duty of this international body will be to regulate and govern
Cyberspace.  This new international body will establish courts of their own.  These courts will
exclusively hear cases that arise out of cyber-law disputes and issues.  It is possible that this
information based cyber court system will be the basis, or catalyst, for an eventual breakdown of
all international borders  allowing for the free flow of people and goods to follow the free flow of
ideas and words now pouring across those borders via the Internet.<P>

<a name="tech1"><p align="center">I. Introduction</a>

<p>Since the dawn of time, attorneys have belatedly embraced evolving technology.  Critics claim
that attorneys benefit from maintaining the status quo.  The truth is apt to be that attorneys tend
to be technically inept, and the technically inept rarely perceive the immediate benefits of new
technology.  Unfortunately, time is on the side of technology.  

<p>Ever since the "Pony Express" days the government and the business sector have endeavored to
improve communication.  In the past decade, communication technology has rapidly advanced. 
First came the fax machine, then the cellular phone, and now the Internet.

<p>The Internet is a worldwide network of computers.  The Internet facilitates the electronic publishing of text, images, and voice on an international scale.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
<p>  Since 1990, the Internet has become a
conduit for public and private information.  The newest technology focuses on further utilizing
the Internet's capabilities. 

<p>Communications technology will continue to progress, as more and more people begin utilizing
the Internet.  Clients will eventually expect their attorneys to use the Internet just as they now
expect them to have a fax machine.  Of course there will be a few attorneys who will never use
the Internet, just as there are those who refuse to use computers.  However, our clients will be
using the Internet and we should be there to greet them.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech2"><p align="center">II.  How Attorneys Can Use the Internet</a>

<p>The Internet has many applications in the practice of law.  In order to determine all the possible
applications, I decided to seek information from the sharpest minds on the Internet.  As part of
my research, I sent questionnaires to a sample of firms that have already established a web page
on the Internet.  The responses were intriguing. 

<p>All of the firms that I surveyed use the Internet for research.  The United States Federal Courts,
including the U.S. Supreme Court, are not currently publishing their opinions on the Internet. 
However, the Villanova Law School maintains a web page called "The Federal Court Locator"
where attorneys can view the most recent opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Federal
Circuit Courts.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  Additionally, a few state courts have set up their own web page to publish court
information and case opinions.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  
Federal and state agencies also publish their statutes and
regulations on the Internet.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  There are even some municipalities throughout the country that are
publishing their local regulations, city ordinances and general information about the city, the
people, and the climate.

<p>Attorneys can also access the U.S. Senate's<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
and the U.S. House of Representatives'<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>
web pages to see what bills are before Congress, where in the legislative process a particular bill may
be, and in some cases, even get some idea of whether the bill is expected to pass.  The
Congressional web pages are updated daily while Congress is in session.  Attorneys can also take
a virtual tour of the White House, view White House archives and even leave a message for the
President.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
<p>   

<p>There are also private web sites such as Law Journal Extra<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
that provide up to date information
on many precedent setting cases including recent decisions affecting the Internet.  Another site,
Find Law, Internet Legal Resources, provides a list of all the law related resources on the
Internet.  This one web page has links<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>
to statutes and laws, judicial opinions, federal
government resources, state government resources, foreign and international resources, law
student resources, consultants and experts, law firms and lawyers, legal employment, legal forms,
law schools, law reviews, legal publishers, legal associations, and even continuing legal
education (CLE).<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>
 

<p>A wealth of information can also be found on many law school web pages.  Villanova's<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>
and Yale's<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>
 web pages provide links to law related sites and publish articles written by faculty, law
students and attorneys.  Some law schools even publish their Law Review articles on the Internet.

<p>Law firm web pages are another source of information that is often overlooked.  Most of the law
firm web pages that I viewed had links to federal and state government information, municipal
information and even industry information.  One site in particular, Bricker and Eckler,<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>
has a list of links catalogued by practice area, so that their attorneys can go to one site to start their
research.  Web pages with numerous links are popular starting points for research attorneys. <a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Attorneys are doing more than just research on the Internet.  Most of the firms I surveyed use e-mail to communicate with clients or potential clients.  Larger firms, with distant offices, used e-mail extensively for interoffice communications and distributing firm information to all associate
attorneys.  Practically all of the firms I surveyed expressed reservations about discussing private
issues via e-mail because of security concerns.  However, most of the firms felt that e-mail was
vital for setting up meetings and maintaining contact with distant clients.  One attorney even
stated that he extended his workday by answering his e-mail after office hours from the comfort
of his home. 

<p>A few attorneys felt that an e-mail address was essential in order to gain or keep clients who are
becoming more and more technology dependent.  In a world where efficiency reigns supreme,
some clients may decide it is impractical to retain a law firm that lacks an e-mail account.  Soon,
clients may expect their attorney to have an e-mail address just as they now expect their attorney
to be listed in the yellow pages. 

<p>E-mail is not the only way to communicate on the Internet.  In fact, the Internet offers remarkable
communication capabilities.  Firms with offices located in different cities can now use new
software<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> to share documents and conduct interoffice staff meetings over the Internet.  This
new software enables a firm to conduct meetings through the Internet with video and sound
(video conferencing).  For about $500 per site, a firm can conduct video conferencing with
distant offices or clients.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>   Firms could easily save thousands of dollars in travel and long
distance charges by video conferencing over the Internet.

<p>Another interesting use for the Internet that only a few firms mentioned, is discovery.  Attorneys
can actually use the Internet to investigate a case.  While there is a vast amount of information to
be discovered on the Internet, the most innovative use that I have seen is with regard to expert
witnesses.  Apparently, many experts publish articles on the Internet.  Attorneys can use the
Internet to find articles related to a case they are handling.  Once the firm finds an article that
supports their case, they can contact the author to see if he is willing to testify in their client's
behalf.  Attorneys should always check the Internet to make sure their expert witness has not
published any articles contrary to their claim because an opposing attorney can use article to
impeach or discredit the expert's testimony.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>
An astute attorney can probably find countless
other ways to use the Internet for discovery.

<p>Incidentally, the Internet can also be used to look for plaintiffs or witnesses in a class action suit. 
Attorneys can post questions or information about the proposed suit and then wait for people to
respond.  For example, suppose a client wants to pursue a tort claim against a major automobile
manufacturer for injuries he received when the brakes on his car failed.  The manufacturer is
claiming that the client's accident was an isolated incident and should only have to pay actual
damages.  The attorney investigates locally, but is unable to find any similar incidences with the
type of car the client owns.  Rather than give up, the attorney posts a message on the Internet
asking if anyone who owns the same type of car has had brake problems.  The message is then
accessed by people around the world, and, within a few weeks, the attorney has found enough
injured parties to file a class action suit against the manufacturer.  By using the Internet, the
attorney can satisfy his client, find more plaintiffs, and save thousands of dollars in discovery
costs.

<p>One interesting idea that was not mentioned by any of the firms I surveyed, is the completion of
depositions over the Internet.  This would be particularly useful where expert witnesses or other
parties live a long distance from the firm. With the advent of video conferencing,<sup> </sup><a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>
even deposing a hostile witness is possible.  However, Internet security will be a concern when the
case involves sensitive information. 

<p>The most interesting and efficient use of the Internet is for court document filing.  Court
document filing is only available in a few jurisdictions, but almost all the firms surveyed said
they would use it if it became available in their area.  The Northern District of Ohio Courts<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>

<p>have been operating an online filing system since January 1996 for asbestos related claims.  New
York Bankruptcy Courts are currently testing the possibility, and a few other states are
considering it.  Unfortunately, the speed at which a particular court will pursue electronic filing is
determined by the judge in that jurisdiction.  Just like practicing attorneys, some judges readily
embrace the new technology while others continue to ignore its existence.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>
  It may be some time before a significant number of courts allow electronic document filing.

<p>Surprisingly, some courts are considering other Internet possibilities besides just electronic
document filing.  Houston, Texas courts have looked into the possibility of allowing traffic
offenders to plead and pay their fine over the Internet.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>
  Any attorney who has ever been to traffic court in Houston, or in any other large city, understands how much easier an electronic
system would be for everyone.  Fortunately, these "ideas" will soon become reality.

<p> The most prolific use of the Internet has been for advertising.  Practically every site on the
Internet has some form of advertising, and law firms are no exception. Virtually all of the firms I
surveyed had originally set up their web page for advertisement.  Firm web pages advertise to
both potential clients and other attorneys.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>
  However, most of the web pages I viewed did more than just advertise the firm.

<p>The law firm web pages that I viewed contained a variety of information.  Nearly all of the firms
published their firm's history and the areas of the law that they specialize in.  Many also
published brief resumes of the partners and associates, and a few published a list of their major
clients and any precedent setting cases they had won.  Some firms announced permanent
employment opportunities, and even discussed their summer associate programs.  There was
even one site that displayed a map describing how to find the firm's office.

<p> One of the most interesting sites I discovered was Haynes and Boone's web page.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>
<p>  In addition to information about the firm, this web page also contained geographical information on all the
cities where an office of the firm was located.  The geographical information included the
weather and climate of the area, and the entertainment and cultural spots located within the area.
Haynes and Boone's web page also included sports information on all the college and
professional teams located in the area.  To top it all off, this web page even included links to
other interesting Texas web sites.

<p>A few firms are also publishing their internally produced articles on their web page.  For
instance, some firms, which specialize in one area of the law, have published documents that
answer the most frequently asked questions or give law advice.  A few firms even addressed
computer and Internet related law on their web page.  By educating the public and potential
clients, the attorneys are making their job a little easier.  For example, a municipal law firm in
Pennsylvania<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> uses their web site to educate the public on all the constraints that the local
government works under.  Even though they only reach a small percentage of the public, these
attorneys are convinced that they are improving their business.  Of course, firms that publish
advisory documents must be careful in order to avoid liability for incorrect information.  It is
probably a good idea to include a caveat in all "advisory" type documents warning users that they
should consult with an attorney before relying on any information contained on the firm's web
page.  

<p>In addition to publishing internally prepared articles, some larger firms are using their web page
to publish their firm newsletter.  The cost of publishing the newsletter online is substantially less
than sending out printed copies.  As more clients procure e-mail addresses, this feature will
become even more beneficial.  The firm could then broadcast their newsletter to every client with
an e-mail address within seconds. 

<p>A few attorneys are also using their web page to make political statements.  These statements
serve two purposes: to inform the public and to advertise the firm's philosophy in order to attain
like-minded clients.  Attorneys have always been at the forefront of every political issue. 
Attorneys are vocal about their beliefs,  especially when they are unconventional beliefs.  An
Internet web page allows politically active attorneys an enormous public forum.  However, a firm
publishing political information may seriously limit their ability to gain clients who have
conflicting political beliefs. 

<p>Since the purpose of most law firm web pages is to reach potential clients, almost all of the web
sites have an e-mail program embedded in the web page so that users can e-mail someone in the
firm just by pressing a "hot" button.  This "hot" button pulls up the e-mail program with the
firm's e-mail address already in it.  All the user has to do is enter their message and then hit the
"send" button.  If the sender has entered their e-mail address, a member of the firm can respond
quickly to most questions, and perhaps acquire a new client. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><a name="tech3">III.  Future Benefits of the Internet</a>

<p>In the future, the Internet could have a dramatic impact on the efficiency and workload of law
firms.  Law firms will one day be able to find, engage, and collect from clients located all over
the world.  Law firms can already collect their fees over the Internet by allowing their clients to
pay their bill by credit card.  However, without some type of encryption,<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>
collecting money over the Internet is dangerous to your client's financial health, because other Internet users can easily
copy the information and then use it fraudulently.  Consequently, firms should discourage clients
from transmitting any private information over the Internet. 

<p>The next technological step in collecting fees will be electronic banking.  Fortunately, the
banking system in this country is already using electronic transfers to move money quickly. 
Once they have perfected their system, it is just a matter of time before it becomes available to
everyone.  When it becomes available, clients will be able to electronically transfer money from
their bank account directly to the firm's bank account.  The new electronic banking system will
allow attorneys to readily collect their fees.

<p>Attorneys who are currently using the Internet realize the future possibilities, but most are
concerned about information security and confidentiality.  Encryption technology may solve
many confidentiality problems.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>
  However, signatures, which are necessary to legally bind
parties to a contract or engagement agreement, pose a more significant dilemma.  

<p>Obviously, it is virtually impossible to prove that someone agreed to a contract without some sort
of "electronic signature."  One suggested method of dealing with this is to assign everyone a
unique code.  This code would identify them and be proof of their assent to a contract or
engagement agreement.  However, before the coding method becomes a reality, a serious point of
contention must be resolved:  Who will be responsible for issuing, storing and securing the
codes?  At this time, no one has answered that question.  

<p>If the technology gurus establish an electronic signature system, attorneys will be able to send
and receive over the Internet all the documents they currently use.  Even interrogatories and
admissions could be handled over the Internet without losing their evidentiary value.  Once
encryption and electronic signature technology are perfected, the legal possibilities for the
Internet are endless.     

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech4"><p align="center">IV.  Internet Access Costs</a>

<p>There are two ways to gain Internet access:  Direct Internet access and indirect Internet access. 
Direct access is achieved by hooking your computer directly into the Internet communications
network.  Indirect Internet access is obtained by dialing into a server<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> 
that is tied directly to the Internet.  Internet access is relatively inexpensive if you choose indirect Internet access by renting
time through an Internet provider.  Most large cities have a number of companies offering
Internet access.  These Internet Service Providers charge anywhere from $20 to $1,000 per month
depending upon how many data lines you need and how much space you want to reserve on the
provider's server.  The majority of the surveyed firms only spend around $40 per month for
Internet access.  In most cases, the access fee also includes the space needed to publish a web
page.  However, there are a few larger firms who spend more than $1,000 per month for Internet
access.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>

<p>For large firms, direct access may be less expensive over the long run.  The initial set up fee for
direct Internet access is $20,000-30,000.  By eliminating indirect access fees and by renting
access to other parties,<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>
 a firm can defray a large portion of the costs and even make a profit. 
One of the larger firms surveyed rents Internet access time to their clients and then helps them set
up their own web page.  By offering this additional service, the firm has strengthened the client's
connection to the firm.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>
  However, for the majority of firms, it will be more economical to rent
access to the Internet through an established Internet Service Provider.

<p>In addition to the cost of obtaining Internet access, firms must also purchase Internet access
software.  The software conforms the complicated Internet programming language into a more
manageable Windows based format.  Most of the software available is easy to use and costs less
than $100.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>
 

<p>Compared to Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis access, indirect Internet access sounds inexpensive. 
However, WestLaw's and Lexis-Nexis' databases are more comprehensive and more organized
than the Internet.  At the present time, the Internet is so unorganized that you can literally spend
days researching one issue.  Additionally, only a small percentage of court opinions are published
on the Internet.  At this time, it is questionable whether all the courts will ever publish their
opinions on the Internet.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>
<p> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><a name="tech5">V.  Cost of Initiating and Maintaining a Web Page</a>

<p>Web pages come in all shapes and sizes.  In order to determine how much a web page will cost,
two questions need to be answered:

<p>1. Does the firm have anyone employed who is capable of setting up and running a web site?

<p>2. How sophisticated (graphics, links, etc.) will the web page be?

<p>Outside experts generally costs more than an in-house employee to design and initiate a web
page.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>
  The more sophisticated the web page, the more time required to program it, and thus,
the higher the initial cost.  These two factors determine the initial expense of a web page, and as
a result, the initial cost will vary greatly from firm to firm.

<p>The smaller firms,<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>
 either by necessity or by choice, usually have an in-house attorney who sets
up and maintains their web page.  While the cash investment may be low, the actual cost in this
situation is the attorney's time invested in the web page multiplied by their billing rate.  The time
spent programming or changing the web page is time that cannot be billed to a client.  According
to my survey, the firms that set up their own web page spent an average of six hours to design
and program<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>
 their web page.  While programming time varied depending upon the level of
sophistication chosen for the web page, learning how to construct the page appears to have been
the most time consuming.  There are many programs available to help inexperienced web page
designers build a web page.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>
  Most design software uses picture files to build the web page. 
The designer can use files that have already been saved to disc, or they can be downloaded from
the Internet.  A lot of web page designers use pictures downloaded from the Internet.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>
  The Harris County Courts in Houston, Texas, freely admit in a statement posted on their web site that
almost all of the graphics included on the page were downloaded from other sites on the
Internet.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While most of the graphics on the Internet are free, designers need to be aware that pictures
displayed on some sites may be copyrighted.  In addition, some sites may be illegally using
pictures that are copyrighted by other entities.  Before web page designers download pictures
from the Internet, they need to verify that it is not copyrighted material or a trademark.

<p>Rather than use in-house attorneys, the large law firms I surveyed used on-staff computer
engineers to design and maintain their web page.  Prior to adding a web page, the larger firms
had already hired computer engineers to maintain their networked computer systems.  If the
firm's computer network is large enough to keep a computer engineer busy, it is cost effective to
hire an engineer full time.  However, a few firms did contract with independent computer design
companies to set up and maintain the firm's web site.  

<p>Interestingly, the larger firms' web pages were generally not any more sophisticated than many of
the smaller firms' web pages.  Nonetheless, my survey of firms revealed that large firms spent
substantially more than the smaller firms to initiate their web page.  A few firms paid as much as
$6,000 to have their web page professionally built.  The best advice I can offer is to quote
Bradford A. Bleier: "Do it yourself! [create a web page]  Drafting a page like a yellow page add
takes almost no time, and [it] is vastly cheaper than the various rip off artists who prey upon the
technical inability of the legal profession." <a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The amount of time that firms spent to maintain their web page each month varied consistently
with the time invested in designing and initiating their web page.  The more sophisticated the
web page, the more time firms spent each month updating it.  The firms that published their own
newsletter or other articles on their web page frequently updated their site with new information. 
However, the firms that only published their brochure<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>
 or another short advertisement, rarely spent any time maintaining it.  I found several law firm sites on the Internet that had not been
updated in over six months.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>
  Nonetheless, on average, the firms spent about three hours a month updating their web page.

<p>As mentioned before, a firm that publishes vast amounts of information will spend more time
each month maintaining their web site.  However, even though it cost more, a web site with a lot
of content may be worth the additional cost.  

<p>To find information and new web sites on the Internet, you have to use a search engine.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>
  A search engine uses the key words you have entered to search all the sites on the Internet.  The
search engine will then rank the sites found according to how many of the key words are present
in the site.  Since your web site will not be discovered without the key words that the search
engine is looking for, it makes sense that the more information you publish on your web site, the
more "hits" your page will receive.  Another reason to put up content is that people are tired of
reading advertisements.  If your web page consists only of a firm brochure, most web browsers
will never give it a second glance, provided they find it at all.  In one respect a web page is
similar to a trial.  If you can get the audience's attention you have a lot higher chance of selling
them your version of the facts or, in this case, your firm's expertise.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><a name="tech6">VI.  The Demise of the Traditional Office</a>

<p>In the near future, attorneys will be able to find new clients and collect fees over the Internet. 
They will be able sign contracts and file court documents over the Internet as well.  Since
attorneys will be able to access the Internet from home, will the traditional office disappear?  

<p>For some attorneys, the traditional office has already disappeared.  The Thierman Law Firm<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>
 is a true Internet based law firm.  This firm is composed of 14 attorneys located around the country
and their specialty is computer and Internet law.  They use the Internet to communicate with
clients and with each other.  Most of the attorneys work on a contract basis from their own office
or home.  Firm announcements are posted on the firm's web page so that all attorneys can stay in
touch.  The Thierman Law Firm operates as a national referral network, thus making the
traditional law office obsolete.

<p>Individual attorneys could easily work from their home if they are not interested in litigation. 
Attorneys who want to prepare briefs on a contract basis will be able to research and send
documents over the Internet from their home.  Attorneys could prepare contracts, wills, or other
documents at home as well.  They could also communicate with and collect money from clients
located thousands of miles away.  

<p>However, most attorneys need the traditional law office.  No matter how technologically
advanced the rest of the world becomes, there will always be some clients who want to talk to an
attorney face-to-face.  Besides, most attorneys know that 75% of all human communication is
transmitted through body language.  Attorneys need face-to-face communication to know when
they are getting the full story from a client or witness.  

<p>Body language becomes particularly important when taking depositions.  Good attorneys can tell
when they have a witness backed into a corner.  Without an office, how are depositions going to
be handled?  An attorney cannot read body language over the Internet.  Video conferencing<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>
will help, but it may not be good enough in some cases.

<p>Another reason to keep the traditional office is to have a place for attorneys to meet and discuss
large or important cases.  To think effectively, attorneys need a place that is comfortable.  An
office is ideal because it brings everything they need together in one place.

<p>Additionally, Most firms need a working environment for the attorneys and staff.  The problem
with working at home is that there can be too many interruptions.  Some people do not work well
from their homes because they need a working environment in order to get anything
accomplished.  Many attorneys and staff members also enjoy the socialization and camaraderie
that develops in the traditional office setting.  The traditional office provides the working
environment necessary to promote camaraderie and maximum staff efficiency.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech7"><p align="center">VII.  Conclusion</a>

<p>The possibilities for the Internet are endless.  Many attorneys have already begun embracing this
new technology in hopes of gaining some benefit.  None of the firms I surveyed had maintained a
web page for more than three years.  However, approximately half of the surveyed firms had
sustained their web page for more than one year.  One-fourth of the surveyed firms had
established their web page within the last six months and the rest had initiated their web page
between six months and year ago.  Realistically, only a small portion of the firms in this country
have their own web page.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>
  Nevertheless, more firms are connecting to the Internet and building
their own web page every day.  

<p>As more attorneys and courts gain Internet access, the demand for better and more sophisticated
software will mushroom.  The computer software companies will continue to turn out new
programs to meet the growing demand.  If the computer industry continues to advance at the
speed it has the last few years, we will have virtual reality court rooms by the end of this century.  

<p>In a virtual reality courtroom, jurors could participate in the trial from the comfort of their own
home.  The attorneys could make their arguments in their shorts while virtual reality shows them
dressed in their best Armani suits.  Plaintiffs and defendants could participate in the trial without
leaving their jobs and the media could tune in without interfering in the trial.  This may sound
farfetched, but this technology already exists.  

<p>At the end of my survey, I asked all the firms if they had any advice to give attorneys who might
be considering a web page.  Overwhelmingly, the firms said that every attorney should have an
Internet presence.  At the bare minimum, all attorneys should have an e-mail address.  Practically
all of the surveyed firms used the Internet for research. Without Internet access, you are at a
disadvantage if you have to face one of these firms in the courtroom.

<p>Most of the firms believe that their web page has enhanced their business.  Some firms reported
having over 2,000 "hits" per day.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>  The only disadvantage mentioned  by any firm was the time
it took to maintain the site each month.  With so little to lose and so much to gain, all attorneys
need an Internet presence.

<p><a name="N_14_">14. </a>The reason web pages with links to other related sites are so popular is because it is sometimes tedious to do
research using the search engines.   Search engines facilitate Internet information searches by allowing you to enter
key words which are then used to find Internet sites containing the key words.  The two problems with the search
engines are one, they are slow, and two, identical searches on separate days can result in different sites to peruse. 

<p><a name="N_15_">15. </a>I visited the CompUSA store in Lubbock, Texas to find out what software was available for video c onferencing over the Internet.  All of the programs I examined allowed document sharing, video e-mail messages, and "real
time" audio and video through the Internet.  Video Phone, by Connectix, retails for around $60; AudioVision, by
Smith Micro, retails for around $100; and Enhanced CU-SeeMe, by White Pine, retails for around $70.  Enhanced
CU-SeeMe will support up to eight people video conferenced together at the same time.  Additionally, in order to
use any of the above programs, you must have Internet access, a sound board, a 28.8k modem, and a digital camera.
Connectix produces a digital camera, Quickcam, that will work with all of these programs.  The color version of
Quickcam retails for around $230 and the black and white version retails for around $120.

<p>      While video through the Internet is "real time," motion will appear to be "jumpy" because of
the delay caused by slow transmission speeds.  Even the newest 34k modems cannot transmit
data over a standard phone line fast enough to prevent "jerky" motion.  However, there is a solution: ISDN.  ISDN is the newest and fastest modem.  An ISDN modem can transmit information
at speeds up to 128k per minute.  Unfortunately, a standard phone line cannot keep pace.  In order to use an ISDN modem, the local telephone company has to replace your standard phone line
with two ISDN phone lines.  An ISDN modem at CompUSA retails for around $350.     
Southwestern Bell, Lubbock's local telephone service provider, charges $58 per month plus any
long distance charges, and a one time installation fee of $250 for ISDN service.  Long distance
charges should be minimal if you have local Internet access.  As a side benefit, ISDN also
increases the amount of information that can be downloaded from the Internet. 

<p><a name="N_16_">16. </a>"Traditional" Video conferencing units can be found in many medical schools, law schools, and company
boardrooms.  These video conferencing units use a dedicated digital phone line to transmit information between
locations.  The set-up costs for these units is $30,000- 50,000 per location.  Additionally, the phone company will
charge $1500 or more per month for the dedicated telephone line.  Video Conferencing via satellite is even more
expensive.  Internet video conferencing is substantially less expensive than "traditional" video conferencing. 

<p><a name="N_17_">17. </a>For example, suppose an expert witness in the petroleum industry has been retained by an oil company which
is a defendant in a tort claim.  Prior to the accident, the expert has published an article on the Internet which details
the safety procedures to be followed by a refinery.  The plaintiff's  attorney expects this expert to testify that the oil
company followed reasonable procedures to prevent the accident.  The plaintiff's attorney  then discovers the expert's article and establishes that the oil company did not follow the guidelines in the article.  If the expert then testifies in trial that the oil company followed all the guidelines necessary to prevent the accident, the firm can impeach
him with his own article.

<p><a name="N_20_">20. </a>In all fairness, budget and time constraints in some courts hamper the judges' ability to study the feasibility of
new technology.  

<p><a name="N_21_">21. </a>Traffic offenders will be able to pay their fines by credit card.

<p><a name="N_22_">22. </a>For instance, suppose a law firm which specializes in commercial contract litigation has a valuable client wanting to press a tort claim.  If the firm does not want to handle the claim, they can search the Internet for a nearby law
firm which specializes in tort claims.  By helping their client find a competent firm, they have garnered favor with
that client.  The next time that client has a commercial contract dispute, he will most likely seek the firm which has

<a name="tech1"><p align="center">I.  Introduction</a>

<p>The Employment Retirement Income Security Act, otherwise known as ERISA, was enacted in
an effort to ensure that employers neither would reduce nor terminate employment benefits
arbitrarily after extending them to their employees.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  Congress found that, despite the growth in the number of employers which were providing benefit plans, many employees with lengthy years of service still were losing anticipated retirement benefits.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  Clearly-defined standards
were needed.  Therefore, in its quest to assure the equitable character and financial soundness of
these plans, Congress created ERISA in 1974.  Notwithstanding its relatively long existence,
however, those responsible for following its mandates still struggle, not seeming to understand
much of what is required.  The result has been a surge in litigation in an area where employees
formerly were not as aware of their rights.  Although ERISA was designed specifically to deal
with long-standing abuses in the administration and investment of private pension plans, it also
applies to fringe benefits such as medical and hospital care benefits; benefits which cover
sickness, disability, unemployment, or death; child care benefits; prepaid legal services; and
other benefits allowed under section 3(1) of ERISA.

<p>ERISA contains a substantial preemption provision.  It, not state law, governs the regulation of
pension and benefit plans<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> except for in a few statutory-defined instances.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>
  Still, deciding whether ERISA or state law controls has not been always clear-cut, and thus, a large number of cases have addressed the issue.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  One of the greatest disappointments benefits claimants have faced in recent cases is having their state law claims preempted by ERISA only to learn afterward that they could expect no sort of relief whatsoever.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  Nevertheless, as the Act continues to evolve, employers and plan administrators will be forced to stay abreast.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>One way plan administrators can avoid some of the pitfalls is by managing their benefit plans
electronically.  Through a combination of retirement income planning software and the myriad
resources available on the Internet, plan administrators can increase their awareness and track
changes in the applicable laws more efficiently.  The planning software will help them to develop
a baseline formula for each employee.  Then, as contributions are being made on the employee's
behalf, administrators can put that information on-line to be accessed by the employee at the
employee's convenience.  No longer will the level of each individual's benefits be shrouded in
mystery.  Moreover, with all of the government and non-governmental sponsored resources on
the World Wide Web ("WWW" or "Web"), employers and plan administrators should have an
easier time staying abreast of ERISA by learning exactly what is required of them and what
assistance is available to them.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech2"><p align="center">II.  ERISA:  The Basics</a>

<p>Employers sponsor benefit plans for their workers in hopes of decreasing staff turnover, fueling
employee morale and retaining only the most efficient in their pool of employees.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>  Another
advantage of employer-sponsored benefit plans is that, in the long run, they reduce individual
dependence on government programs.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>  Theoretically, excellent benefits facilitate the
replacement of older, less productive workers with younger, more productive ones.  Senior
workers whose "golden years" are well-provided for are more inclined to retire, and as they leave
the work force, room is made for their younger counterparts.  As a result, operating efficiency
supposedly is maintained or increased.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>ERISA does not require that employers provide pensions or other benefits, nor does it specify at
what level those benefits should be provided in the event the employer decides to provide them. 
Instead, its objective is to establish minimum standards to protect employees from breach of
benefit promises made by employers.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  Employers thus are required to consult ERISA, as well as the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC" or "Code"), in order to determine what are those minimum
standards.

<p>The absence of "vesting"<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> provisions in pension plans often left employees vulnerable to the caprice of their employers.  Since they had no idea as to when they became entitled to receive or what constituted cause for terminating their benefits, there was substantial opportunity for abuse.  Therefore the concept of vesting, whereby an employee's rights in his "accrued benefits"<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> are rendered "nonforfeitable,"<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>
 became a cornerstone in the creation of ERISA.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  No longer are
employers free to determine eligibility and forfeiture criteria on a whim.<a ref="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>
  ERISA offers only a few options, and the employer's plan must conform to one of them.  The Act's three (3) basic options are as follows:

<p><strong>1.</strong> An employee who has completed at least five (5) years of service has a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of his accrued benefit which has been derived from employer contributions.  This is referred to as five-year cliff vesting.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.</strong> An employee has a nonforfeitable right to a percentage of his accrued benefit derived from
employer contributions determined according to the following table:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Years Nonforfeitable</strong>

<p><strong>of service percentage</strong>

<p>3 20

<p>4 40

<p>5 60

<p>6 80

<p>7 or more 100

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A plan under this schedule is referred to as seven-year graded vesting.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>3.</strong> An employee who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement described in ERISA section 3(37)(A)(ii) and who has completed at least ten years of service has a nonforeitable right
to 100 percent of his accrued benefit derived from employer contributions which have been made
to a <strong>multi-employer plan</strong>. <a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>
<p>  (Emphasis added.)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>An employee's rights in his accrued benefit derived from his own contributions remain
nonforfeitable always.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>
  While it is important to note that ERISA does permit plans to vary
from the formats offered in section 203(a)(2), an employer also should note that its plan will
comply only if the benefits vest earlier and in greater amounts than are required under law.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Three government agencies are responsible for administering ERISA.  The Pension and Welfare
Benefits Administration ("PWBA"), a subdivision of the Department of Labor, is committed to
educating and assisting plan sponsors, administrators, participants, and beneficiaries in order to
promote voluntary compliance and to facilitate self-regulation.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>
  The agency's mission is to:

<p><strong>1.</strong> deter and correct violations of the relevant statutes;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.</strong> develop policies and laws that encourage the growth of employment-based benefits;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>3.</strong> assist workers in getting the information they need to protect their benefit rights; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>4.</strong> assist plan officials in understanding the requirement of the relevant statutes in order to meet
their legal responsibilities.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The PWBA fulfills its mission by helping plan sponsors to define their plans and by investigating
suspension and termination of benefits.  It also is responsible for all record-keeping and reporting
to the Department of Labor.  Plan administrators which commit violations under ERISA face
civil penalties<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> as well as criminal ones.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") of the Department of the Treasury cooperates with the
Department of Labor in enforcing ERISA's minimum standards provisions.  When it was
creating ERISA, Congress found that pension and benefit plans have a significant effect on tax
revenues because of the preferential tax treatment they receive.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>
  Therefore, plan sponsors and
administrators are required to be aware not only of the mandates under ERISA, but they also
need to be aware of the plan qualification rules outlined in the IRC.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>
  Plans which comply with
the Code benefit employers and employees alike.  First, employees are not taxed on their accrued
benefits until the funds are disbursed at retirement.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>
  Second, employers receive a current
income tax deduction for all moneys they contribute toward the benefit fund.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>
  Finally, the investment income earned by the fund is completely exempt from taxation.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>
  Plans which fail to comply are disqualified and lose their tax-favored status.  As a result, employees are required to pay tax on future retirement benefits before actually receiving them; employers receive no tax
deductions for contributing toward the fund; and the investment income earned by the fund is
subject to immediate taxation.

<p>The third government agency responsible for administering ERISA is the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC").  The PBGC, which protects the retirement incomes of nearly
42 million workers participating in defined benefit plans,<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>
 was established under ERISA as a means of insuring against an unacceptable level of risk of failure among firms with under-funded pension plans.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>  However, although it acts in the capacity of an insurer, it does not observe the formalities of one.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>  The agency is responsible for paying monthly retirement benefits to retirees who participated in terminated plans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech3"><p align="center">III.  The Plausibility of Electronic Management</a>

<p>Managing benefit plans under the mandates of ERISA and the Code requires considerable
diligence on the part of plan administrators.  Therefore, a number of sources has arisen over time
with the goal of simplifying the rules and guiding practitioners through the maze which ERISA
has become.  Numerous books and articles have been written, but now, an increasing number of
resources are being found on the Internet.  Organizations dedicated to advancing the knowledge
and understanding of employment benefits issues are providing an abundance of information on-line.  Some organizations engage purely in research and information dissemination.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>
  Some
concentrate their efforts on political lobbying.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>
  Other on-line sites offer various resources on
subjects ranging from politics, business, and finance to aging, health care, and labor issues to
legislative publications and activities.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Americans in growing numbers are becoming increasingly concerned about what form their
financial condition will take during their retirement years.  This anxiety is attributed to the rising
costs of medical care, poor retirement preparation, and the uncertain future of Social Security and
Medicare.  While some current and prospective retirees feel confident that they will have
sufficient money to live comfortably for the duration of their retirement, others are not at all
certain.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>
  Thus, in light of the critical role employment benefits play in the economic future of
our nation, it becomes necessary to manage them in the most efficient manner possible.  One
possible solution is to manage benefit plans electronically.

<p>Employers can utilize electronic media to administer benefit plans by combining the analytical
capabilities of retirement income planning software and the speed of modern
telecommunications.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>
  By gathering investment-return data from the Internet on a routine basis,
plan administrators can track the progress of the plan's portfolio.  That way, the administrator of
a "defined benefit plan" will be in a better position to maximize the plan's assets and thus be able
to rest assured that the plan will pay for itself.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>
  For employers which maintain a "defined contribution plan,"<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>
 each employee will be able to access his own retirement account to
determine what changes he must make in order to maximize his personal retirement income.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>  At least one defined contribution plan is utilizing the Internet as a means of communicating with each employee.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>
  Employees now are able to use the Internet to access information about their
accumulated benefits and to conduct financial transactions.  The plan also provides prospectuses
on-line.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Employers stand to benefit tremendously from electronic management.  For one thing, the
volume of paperwork created which must be stored is drastically reduced.  Furthermore, for the
employer which is considering implementing a benefit plan, the Internet is replete with actual
plans from other organizations which can be used as models.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>
  By examining other plans, that
employer can decide what may and what may not work for its business.  Employees also stand to
benefit because information on their prospective retirement income will be more accessible to
them.  Once the plan administrator puts the benefits information on-line, employees will be able
to access the information from their computer work stations or, using a modem, from their home
computers.  That way, they can check the progress of their accumulating retirement benefits and
make any necessary adjustments.

<p>Government agencies<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>
 as well as non-governmental organizations<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>
 regularly post legislative
material and other official publications on the Web.  After the employer puts its plan on-line, it
could create links from each provision in the plan to the corresponding section(s) in ERISA, the
IRC, and the pertinent Labor and Treasury regulations.  That way, the employer (or plan
administrator) can remain circumspect of any changes in the law and adjust the provisions of the
plan accordingly.  Plan administrators need to be aware, however, that the information presented
on-line may contain inaccuracies rendering it unreliable.  Moreover, if the administrator winds
up violating ERISA as a result of having relied on the information it derived from an on-line
source, the provider of that information may not be held liable since most, if not all of them,
disclaim liability for any damage arising out of using the information they provide.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>  That applies both to government and non-governmental sites.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<a name="tech4"><p align="center">IV.  Preparing Plan-Related Documents for On-Line Publication</a>

<p>All text, graphics, video, and sound to be published on the Web first must be formatted in
HyperText Markup language ("HTML").<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>  Although most Web browsers<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a> will display
documents which have been written in plain text, an HTML document offers formatting,
graphics, and links to other documents.<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>  The result is a far more user-friendly on-line
publication.

<p>Before a plan administrator can post the plan's documents on a Web site, the documents first
must be translated into the language of the Web which is HTML.  HTML is not a hard-core
computer programming language.  It employs a set of instruction codes which, when placed into
the document, makes the document look on-line as it did in its fully formatted hardcopy version.

<p>Creating a very basic HTML document requires only a few commands.  These commands appear
in different formats depending on whether they are "containers" or "separators."  "Containers"
usually have an opening command and a closing command.  They appear in this format:

<p>&lt;command name&gt; . . . &lt;/command name&gt;<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<P>"Separators," however, do not require a closing command.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The first and most important set of commands is "&lt;html&gt; . . . &lt;/html &gt;."<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>  This lets Web
browsers know what type of file is being read.  If this command is not placed properly, Web
browsers will not recognize the file as HTML and thus will not recognize other HTML
commands imbedded in the document.  The "&lt;html&gt;" must be placed at the beginning of the
document, and the corresponding "&lt;/html&gt;" must be placed at the end.  If the document has a
title, the command "&lt;title&gt; . . . &lt;/title&gt;" should follow "&lt;html&gt;," with the text of the title
appearing between the opening and closing "&lt;title&gt;"commands.  The opening command
"&lt;body&gt;" should follow the "&lt;title&gt; . . . &lt;/title&gt;" commands and be placed where the main body
of the document will begin.  The closing "&lt;/body&gt;" probably will appear just before the closing
"&lt;html&gt;."  Within "&lt;body&gt;" and "&lt;/body&gt;," however, the author of the Web page will need to
include separator as well as container commands among the text to indicate formatting options
such as paragraph breaks ("&lt;p&gt;"), line breaks ("&lt;br&gt;"), alignment ("&lt;center&gt; . . . &lt;/center&gt;"), and
formatting ("&lt;bold&gt; . . . &lt;/bold&gt;" for bold or "&lt;i&gt; . . . &lt;/i&gt;" for italics), for example.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At any point within the document, the author also may elect to install links to other documents
available on the Web.  A hypertext link enables the user to access other Web publications with a
simple click.  By associating simple words with a Universal Resource Locator ("URL"),

<a name="tech5"><p align="center">V.  Preserving Plan Information On-Line from Unauthorized Alteration</a>

<p>Because employers which offer pension and welfare benefit plans are required to communicate
the details of the plan to their employees and to maintain the plan in written form,<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a> two
questions arise:

<p><strong>1.</strong> Does a plan which is maintained strictly in electronic media fulfill the requirements of a
writing? and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.</strong> How can all interested parties be certain that the on-line plan is not susceptible to tampering?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Welfare and benefit plan documents typically are very long and technical.  Therefore, ERISA
requires employers to condense the actual plan document into a "summary plan description"<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>

<p>("SPD")which explains the circumstances which could result in disqualification, ineligibility,
denial, or loss of benefits<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a> in a manner that is calculated to be understood by the average plan
participant<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a> and which cannot be perceived as misleading, misinforming or failing to inform
participants and beneficiaries.<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a>  The SPD should contain all or substantially all of the information the average participant would deem crucial to a knowledgeable understanding of his benefits under the plan.<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Under the principles of electronic data interchange <a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a> ("EDI"), a SPD which has been placed on-line could fulfill the requirements of a writing.  Courts have been known to place a higher evidentiary value on paper because its contents cannot be altered without betraying signs of
tampering.  On the other hand, data that is stored and managed electronically can be altered
without leaving any sign in the medium.  EDI strives to build data structures such that the data
itself will show evidence of tampering.<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>  It is essential that an on-line SPD not be susceptible to unauthorized alteration since if there is any conflict between the SPD and the terms of the formal plan, the SPD controls.<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>  In EDI, when the electronic message arrives at its destination, the sender gets a "functional acknowledgment" which attests that the data arrived in the same condition in which they were sent.<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>  If the sender and receiver are the only parties involved in the transmission, however, there is no fool-proof method of resolving a controversy which may arise between them as to the content of the transmission.  Only when a third party network is used to link communicating parties can disputes be resolved more reliably since the network may have a copy of the transmission.  The network also tends to have its own audit trail showing when the signals were transmitted and received, and whether the transmission arrived in the
condition in which it was sent.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>  Therefore, a printout of the transmitted document accompanied by the network provider's "report" should be sufficient to constitute a writing since EDI "tags" the data being sent at every stage the of transmission.<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Most individuals are highly sensitive about having their personal and financial data accessible to
the public.  Therefore, to preserve privacy, security measures become indispensable.  EDI is but
one option.  Another option available is encryption.  Encryption works similarly to EDI in that it
"tags" the data with special codes as they are being transmitted.  It too makes forgery difficult,
exposes tampering, and fulfills the requirements of a writing.<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The technology behind encryption is highly technical.<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>  Using a series of mathematical
formulations, it is possible to derive two numbers:  one which converts regular text into a secret
message and another which is capable of reconverting the secret message into regular text. 
When two parties communicate using encryption techniques, the result is similar to one person
sending mail to another's locked mailbox for which only the recipient holds the key.  In the final
analysis, utilizing encryption for communicating on-line results in tamper-resistant messages and
protects the privacy of the communicating parties.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>

<a name="tech6"><p align="center">VI.  Conclusion</a>

<p>Although employers are under no obligation to provide benefits to their workers, many do so as a
means of attracting and retaining a talented work force.  Offering these benefits, however, brings
the employer within the ambit of ERISA, a convoluted body of rules and regulations which set
forth the minimum standards to which benefit plans must conform.  ERISA was created to
remedy the abuses of employers which often would lure individuals into long-term working
relationships under the promise of a retirement pension, only to renege on that promise later on. 
To assist in fulfilling ERISA's goals and enforcing its mandates, Congress designated three
government agencies to administer the Act:  the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration of
the Department of Labor; the Internal Revenue Service; and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation.

<p>Because ERISA is very complicated and dynamic, managing employment benefit plans on-line is
but one avenue to simplifying compliance.  Employees can access the summary plan description
at any time in order to keep abreast of any changes to their entitlements under the plan.  No
longer will they have to worry about "losing that little booklet they got from work."  They will be
able to access personal retirement data at their convenience in order to keep informed as to how
much money they have stored up and whether they will need to make any adjustments in order to
maximize their accumulated benefit.  They also will be able to conduct financial transactions
using their personal computer, with little or no inconvenience, from their work stations or in the
privacy of their homes.  Employers likewise stand to benefit by managing their benefit plans
electronically because, for one thing, the volume of paperwork involved is greatly reduced. 
Moreover, with the host of legislative and other official materials available on-line, employers
and plan administrators can learn very quickly of any changes in law which can affect their
benefit plan(s).  Because the government and non-governmental organizations which publish
these materials on-line openly disclaim all liability for any inaccuracies or damage resulting from
use of the information they dispense, administrators should verify their findings against the
corresponding official printed publications.  Simply put, the ultimate responsibility for
complying with the mandates of ERISA remains the responsibility of employers and plan
administrators.

<p>Modern security techniques such as EDI and encryption render the on-line benefit data and
information free from unauthorized access and alteration.  Thus, the privacy of all concerned is
preserved.

<p>One thing is certain:  managing an employment benefit plan electronically is a viable alternative. 
However, the employer would be left to decide several fundamental but equally important issues
such as providing training for employees who are technologically challenged.  After all, of what
value is a powerful tool if no one knows how to operate it effectively?

<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a><em></em>  <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts</em>, 471 U.S. 724 (1985) addressed the question of
whether a state statute which required that specified minimum mental health care benefits be
provided was preempted by ERISA.  The Supreme Court consulted section 514(b)(2) of the Act
and noted that it contained an insurance saving clause which was intended to preserve any state
law "which regulates insurance, banking, or securities."  Therefore, the court held that the state
law was not preempted by ERISA as it applied to insurance contracts purchased for plans subject
to ERISA.  <em>See also Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux</em>, 481 U.S. 41 (1987) (finding that state tort and
contract claims were preempted by ERISA and noting how strongly legislative history favored
preemption) <em>and Guarino v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em>, 915 F. Supp. 435, 442 (D. Mass. 1995)

to be exclusive.").</sup>

ERISA, notwithstanding its lack of a remedy.</sup>

<p><a name="N_7_">7. </a>  "Employer" and "Plan Administrator" are not mutually exclusive categories.  When an

in-house, "Employer" and "Plan Administrator" are one and the same.

"participation" and "vesting").  Under ERISA, employers are required to allow their employees
to participate (i.e. begin accumulating benefits) in the plan after the employee completes one year
of service.  However, under section 202(a)(1)(B), a plan which does not allow employees to
participate prior to completing two years of service also must provide that such employee will
earn a 100 percent nonforfeitable right to his accrued benefit upon completing those two years. 
The result of this trade-off against delayed participation is a two-year cliff vesting schedule -- far
more generous than any five-year cliff or seven-year graded vesting plan options.</sup>

<p><a name="N_39_">39. </a>  In a defined benefit plan, the employer commits itself to paying each retired employee a set
monthly benefit based on years of service.  Since the employer bears all risks associated with the
investment of plan funds, it is important that the administrator manage those funds responsibly so
that the employer does not have to wind up paying the benefits out of pocket.

<H2> Automatisierung in der Kunststoffextrusion</H2>

<H2>Das Fachgebiet</H2>

Das Fachgebiet Regelungstechnik besch&auml;ftigt sich schwerpunktm&auml;ssig 
mit der Automatisierung verfahrenstechnischer Prozesse.Insbesondere im 
Bereich der Kunststoffverarbeitung (Extrusionstechnik) kann dabei inzwischen 
auf eine langj&auml;hrige Erfahrung zur&uuml;ckgegriffen werden, die sich von
eher theoretischen Arbeiten der mathematischen Modellierung bis hin zu 
industrienahen Kooperationen im Bereich der Proze&szlig;regelung 
und -f&uuml;hrung erstreckt. Die Forschung wird somit in Zusammenarbeit mit 
der Industrie, mit Forschungsorganisationen sowie in Kooperation mit anderen
Hochschulinstituten durchgef&uuml;hrt.<P>

<IMG SRC="../GIF/extdv3.gif"><P>

<B>Bild</B>: Einschnecken-Plastifizierextruder<P>

<H2>Die Forschung im Bereich Extrusion</H2>

Kunststoffverarbeitungsmaschinen - s. Bild - bilden eine wichtige Klasse 
verfahrenstechnischer Prozesse. Man geht davon aus, da&szlig; etwa 
60% der Kunststoffe vor einer endg&uuml;ltigen Verarbeitung einen 
Extrusionsproze&szlig; durchlaufen haben. <P>

Aufgabe der Automatisierungstechnik in diesem Bereich ist das Anfahren, 
das Halten und das &Uuml;berwachen eines nach verfahrenstechnischen Aspekten
eingestellten Betriebspunktes, um eine optimale Produktqualit&auml;t 
sowie Produktion zu erreichen.<BR>

Unter diesen Aspekten wurden in den letzten Jahren innerhalb von 
Arbeitsschwerpunkten insbesondere Verfahren zur Proze&szlig;f&uuml;hrung 
und zur adaptiven Regelung entwickelt. Weiterhin hat die mathematische 
Modellbildung und die Simulation in diesem Bereich st&auml;rkere 
Bedeutung erlangt, da die Entwicklung anspruchsvollerer 
Automatisierungskonzepte einhergeht mit der Entwicklung genauerer 
mathematischer Beschreibungen. Die Arbeiten werden im folgenden kurz 
dargestellt.<P>

 <HR>

<H2> Modellbildung und Simulation instation&auml;rer Extrusionsprozesse</H2>

Voraussetzung f&uuml;r die &uuml;ber den Stand der aktuellen Technik 
hinausgehenden Automatisierung von Extrusionsanlagen ist eine vertiefte 
Kenntnis des dynamischen Proze&szlig;geschehens. Aufbauend auf einem 
modularen Modellkonzept wird derzeit eine Modellbibliothek auf der 
Grundlage mathematischer Modellbildung f&uuml;r den Extrusionsproze&szlig; 
erstellt, so da&szlig; inzwischen weite Teile des Prozesses modelliert und 
simuliert werden k&ouml;nnen. <BR> 

Gleichzeitig wird eine Modellierungs- und Simulationsumgebung - 
<A HREF="cam_info.html"><IMG SRC="../GIF/hand.gif"></A><I>CAMEx</I> - 
entwickelt, die den Ingenieur bei den speziellen Modellierungsaufgaben 
unterst&uuml;tzen soll. Die Arbeiten werden auf SUN-Workstations 
(Sparcstation 10/40, Multiprozessorsystem) durchgef&uuml;hrt, um dem 
gro&szlig;en Rechenbedarf bei den sich ergebenden Simulationen gerecht 
zu werden.<P>


<H2>Identifikation und adaptive Regelung</H2>

Die genaue F&uuml;hrung der Temperatur als wichtigstem Proze&szlig;parameter 
ist mitentscheidend f&uuml;r die Produktqualit&auml;t. Auf der Grundlage 
eines neuen robusten Verfahrens zur Identifikation im geschlossenen 
Regelkreis konnte ein adaptiver Temperaturregler entwickelt werden, 
der hohe Anforderungen an das Einschwingverhalten und die 
station&auml;re Genauigkeit erf&uuml;llt. Die Arbeiten wurden dabei an 
einem zum Fachgebiet geh&ouml;renden Laborextruder durchgef&uuml;hrt.<P>


<H2>Merkmalsbasierte
Proze&szlig;&uuml;berwachung</H2>

Ein besonderes Problem bei der &Uuml;berwachung des Extrusionsprozesses 
liegt darin, da&szlig; viele Qualit&auml;tsmerkmale nicht direkt 
me&szlig;bar sind. Deshalb wurde ein Verfahren entwickelt, das 
&uuml;ber die Dynamik der wichtigsten Systemgr&ouml;&szlig;en 
bei der Extrusion, Schmelzetemperatur und Extrusionsdruck, Aussagen 
&uuml;ber den Proze&szlig;zustand und die Produktqualitaet erm&ouml;glicht.
Das entwickelte Verfahren arbeitet dabei mit Methoden der digitalen 
Signalverarbeitung und der Mustererkennung.An dem Laborextruder konnte 
eine gute &Uuml;bereinstimmung der berechneten Proze&szlig;merkmale 
mit den pysikalischen Gr&ouml;&szlig;en nachgewiesen werden.

<TITLE>CAMEx - Kurzbeschreibung</TITLE>

<H2>CAMEx - Ein experimentelles Werkzeug zur
rechnerunterst&uuml;tzten Modellbildung in der Kunststoffextrusion</H2>
<HR>

<H3>
Automatisierungstechnische Problemstellungen in der Kunststoffextrusion
</H3>

Kunststoffverarbeitungsmaschinen bilden eine wichtige Klasse 
verfahrenstechnischer Prozesse. Man geht davon aus, da&szlig; ca. 60% 
der Kunststoffrohstoffe vor einer endg&uuml;ltigen Verarbeitung einen 
Extrusionsproze&szlig; durchlaufen haben. Bild 1 zeigt eine h&auml;ufig 
verwendete Klasse von Extrudern.<P>
<IMG SRC="../GIF/extdv3.gif"><P>
<B>Bild 1</B> Einschnecken-Plastifizierextruder<P>
 
Aufgabe der Automatisierungstechnik ist hier das Anfahren, Halten und 
&Uuml;berwachen eines nach verfahrenstechnischen Aspekten eingestellten 
Betriebspunktes, um so eine m&ouml;glichst hohe Produktqualit&auml;t sowie 
Produktion zu erreichen. F&uuml;r die Entwicklung und Optimierung 
automatisierungstechnischer Konzepte gewinnt die Modellierung und die 
Simulation des dynamischen Extrusionsprozesses eine immer gr&ouml;&szlig;er 
werdende Bedeutung.
<BR>

Zwar existieren bereits eine Reihe unterschiedlichster
Simulationssysteme f&uuml;r dynamische Prozesse , doch kann f&uuml;r
den Bereich der Extrusion noch nicht auf bestehende, konsistente
Modellbibliotheken zur&uuml;ckgegriffen werden, so da&szlig; die
Analyse dynamischer Proze&szlig;vorg&auml;nge mittels detaillierter
Modelle zur Zeit nur wenig durchgef&uuml;hrt wird, zumal der
Modellierungsvorgang viel Proze&szlig;wissen erfordert und sehr
zeitaufwendig ist.<P>


<H3>
Aufgaben und Ziele des Arbeitsschwerpunktes im Fachgebiet Regelungstechnik
</H3>


Der Arbeitsschwerpunkt besch&auml;ftigt sich mit der Entwicklung eines 
Werkzeuges zur rechnerunterst&uuml;tzten Modellierung 
von dynamischen Extrusionsprozessen, mit dem unabh&auml;ngig von der 
sp&auml;teren Simulatonsplattform Modellbibliotheken angelegt und 
verwaltet werden k&ouml;nnen. <BR>

Ziel dieser Arbeiten war die Realisierung eines Systems, das
<ul>
<li>den Ingenieur bei den verschiedenen Modellierungsaufgaben 
unterst&uuml;tzt,
<LI>fehleranf&auml;llige Teilschritte (Programmierarbeit, 
algebraische Umformungen) automatisiert durchf&uuml;hrt,
<LI>die Wiederverwendung von Modellbausteinen erm&ouml;glicht und damit
<LI>den Weg vom technischen Proze&szlig; hin zur Simulation und Analyse 
desselben verk&uuml;rzt.
</UL>

<H3>Entwicklung von Modellbibliotheken</H3>

Mit Hilfe dieses Modellierungswerkzeuges werden zur Zeit innerhalb des 
Fachgebietes Regelungstechnik verschiedene Teilprozesse von 
Extrusionsanlagen modelliert und in Modellbibliotheken zusammengefa&szlig;t.
Diese Bibliotheken umfassen sowohl verfahrenstechnische Anlagenkomponenten 
sowie Stellglieder und regelungstechnische Systeme.<BR>

Die Modellierung selbst basiert auf bestimmten konzeptionellen 
&Uuml;berlegungen, die unter dem Stichwort verkopplungsorientierte 
Modellbildung [1,6] zusammengefa&szlig;t worden sind. 
Der erste Schritt bei der Modellierung eines Extrusionsprozesses besteht 
hierbei immer in der hierarchischen Strukturierung des Prozesses, 
um die Modellbildung auf einfachere Teilkomponenten zur&uuml;ckf&uuml;hren 
zu k&ouml;nnen.<BR>

Diese Submodelle werden dann modular aufgestellt, wobei die mathematische 
Beschreibung dieser Teilkomponenten unter Umst&auml;nden verschieden sein 
kann. Die Modelle werden in einer Bibliothek abgespeichert und 
k&ouml;nnen durch Verkopplung der Bausteine (Aggregation) wieder zu 
einem Proze&szlig;modell zusammengef&uuml;gt werden. Die 
Verkn&uuml;pfung der Modellbausteine orientiert sich an den 
physikalischen Verkopplungen der entsprechenden Teilprozesse, 
z.B. Masserhaltung.<P>

<H3>Rechnerunterst&uuml;tzung bei der Modellbildung durch 
<I>CAMEx</I></H3>


Da diese Schritte recht komplex, zeitaufwendig und fehleranf&auml;llig sind, 
ist im Rahmen des Arbeitsschwerpunktes ein Rechnerwerkzeug (<I>CAMEx</I>) 
zur Modellbildung, Simulation und Analyse von Extrusionsprozessen 
entwickelt worden, das im wesentlichen auf dem Computeralgebrasystem 
Maple V (Release 3) basiert. Bild 2 zeigt den schematischen 
Aufbau dieses Werkzeuges und demonstriert gleichzeitig die 
unterschiedlichen Einsatzgebiete von Computeralgebra.<P>

<IMG SRC="../GIF/camdv3.gif"><P>
<B>Bild 2</B>: 
Aufbau der Modellierungsumgebung <I>CAMEx</I> in der Version 2.3.<P>

Grundlegend f&uuml;r die Verwendung eines Computeralgebrasystems ist die 
deklarative, simulationssystems-unabh&auml;ngige Beschreibung der 
Modelle und die M&ouml;glichkeit, gro&szlig;e algebraische Umformungen 
vornehmen zu k&ouml;nnen. Da <I>CAMEx</I> wie eine toolbox unter 
Maple verwendet wird, ist es dem Modellierer m&ouml;glich, seine 
Umgebung einfach zu erweitern, z.B. durch Analysewerkzeuge. 
Gleichzeitig ist eine Code-Generierung in C oder Fortran erlaubt, 
so da&szlig; Verkn&uuml;pfungen zu existierender Analyse- oder 
Simulationssoftware (z.B. Matlab/Simulink) einfach zu realisieren sind.<P>

Der Modellierungsumgebung CAMEx liegen folgende Konzepte zugrunde:
<UL>
<LI>Verwendung objektorientierter Konzepte (Klassenbildung, Aufbau 
von Hierarchien durch Abstraktion und Aggregation, Modularit&auml;t, 
Kapselung),
<LI>deklarative Beschreibung unterschiedlicher mathematische Modelle, 
insbesondere Handhabung von Systemen hoher Ordnung,
<LI>eine an der Physik orientierte Verkopplung von Modellen,
<LI>Trennung von Modellbildung und Simulation,
<LI>Generierung von Code aus den symbolischen Proze&szlig;modellen 
f&uuml;r verschiedene Simulatoren (zur Zeit: Ankopplung an NAG-Bibliothek) 
und
<LI>M&ouml;glichkeiten zur Portierung der Modellbibliotheken.
</UL>

Angestrebt wird eine Portierung der Modellbibliotheken auf 
unterschiedliche Plattformen, um so die Verbreitung und 
Wiederverwendbarkeit der Modelle zu erh&ouml;hen. 
So wurde eine Anbindung an das Modellierungswerkzeug Dymola 
bereits verwirklicht. <BR>

CAMEx ist ein rein experimentelles System, das zur Zeit nur dem 
Fachgebiet Regelungstechnik zur Verf&uuml;gung steht. 
Eine gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Verbreitung der Software ist nicht angedacht, 
doch sollen die Modelle verschiedenen Nutzern zug&auml;nglich 
sein.<P>

<H3>Verwendete Soft- und Hardware</H3>

Zur software-technischen Umsetzung der verschiedenen Methoden zur 
Modellierung und Simulation werden im wesentlichen UNIX-Workstations 
der Firma SUN (SPARCstation 10/40 MP) eingesetzt, die unter Solaris 2.3 und 
OpenWindows 3.1 laufen.<BR>
Neben entsprechenden Compilern und OpenWindows-Dienstprogrammen stehen 
weiterhin die Programme Matlab 4.1 zur Visualisierung der Simulationen 
und Maple V Release 3 als Grundlage des Modellierungswerkzeuges zur 
Verf&uuml;gung. Die integrierte Dokumentation und Implementation der 
Modellbausteine wird zuk&uuml;nftig auf der Grundlage eines HTML-Formates 
aufgebaut sein, das mit Hilfe eines WWW-browsers, z.B. Mosaic, 
gelesen werden kann.<P>
<HR>
<H3>F&ouml;rderung / Kooperationen</H3>

Die Entwicklung der Modellbibliothek erfolgt in Zusammenarbeit mit Prof.
Dr.-Ing. S. Dormeier von der FH Bielefeld, 
Fachgebiet Regelungstechnik, innerhalb eines DFG-Forschungsprojektes.<P>

<H2>Diagnostisches Probleml&ouml;sen in der 
Pr&auml;ventiv-  und Leistungsmedizin</H2>

<H3>Forschung im Bereich Medizin/Biologie</H3>
Der Forschungsbereich Medizin/Biologie des Fachgebiets Regelungstechnik
umfa&szlig;t die Anwendung von systemtheoretischen Methoden auf nicht 
technische Aufgabenstellungen aus der sportmedizinischen Forschung und Praxis.
Dem interdisziplin&auml;ren Charakter entsprechend besteht eine enge 
Kooperation mit dem Sportmedizinischen Institut (Prof. Dr. med. H. Liesen) 
der Universit&auml;t-Gesamthochschule Paderborn.<BR>

Es lassen sich zwei Forschungsschwerpunkte unterscheiden:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Entwicklung neuartiger Verfahren zur Leistungsdiagnostik 
durch die Anwendung systemtheoretischer Methoden der quantitativen 
Modellbildung und Simulation (Modellgest&uuml;tzte Diagnostik)</LI>
<LI>Automatisierung routinem&auml;&szlig;iger Entscheidungsaufgaben im 
Rahmen der &auml;rztlichen Untersuchungspraxis in der 
Pr&auml;ventiv- und Leistungsmedizin mit Hilfe moderner Verfahren der
Wissensverarbeitung (Wissensbasierte Systeme)</LI>
</UL>

Die Forschungs- und Entwicklungsprojekte werden in Kooperation mit 
externen Wissenschaftlern durchgef&uuml;hrt und durch Drittmittel finanziert.

<H3>Modellgest&uuml;tzte Leistungsdiagnostik</H3>  

Die Modellbildung und Simulation von dynamischen Vorg&auml;ngen in 
technischen und nicht technischen Anwendungsbereichen hat in den 
vergangenen Jahren zunehmend an Bedeutung gewonnen. 
Diese Entwicklung wurde sowohl durch methodische Fortschritte bei der 
mathematischen Beschreibung von komplexen Systemen, wie auch durch die 
Entwicklung der Rechnertechnik vorangetrieben. 
Auf diese Weise k&ouml;nnen bekannte Problemstellungen besser 
gel&ouml;st oder &uuml;berhaupt erstmals untersucht werden. 
Die Simulationstechnik ist hierdurch in den Rang einer wichtigen 
Querschnittstechnologie ger&uuml;ckt, die immer mehr unterschiedlichste 
wissenschaftliche Disziplinen betrifft.
In der Pr&auml;ventiv- und Leistungsmedizin haben mathematische 
Modelle - beispielsweise &uuml;ber Belastungs- und Anpassungsreaktionen 
des Energiestoffwechsels - bislang eine geringe Bedeutung. 
Gleichwohl besitzen sie einen hohen erkenntnistheoretischen Wert und 
k&ouml;nnen experimentelle Forschungs- und Untersuchungsmethoden 
sinnvoll erg&auml;nzen. Dies gilt insbesondere unter folgenden 
Gesichtspunkten:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Studien zu inneren Proze&szlig;vorg&auml;ngen:<BR> 
Einer der wesentlichen Vorteile mathematischer Modelle besteht darin, 
da&szlig; sie eine Berechnung des Verhaltens im Innern des Prozesses 
erm&ouml;glichen. Im Sinne einer modellgest&uuml;tzten Diagnostik 
lassen sich zus&auml;tzlich nicht me&szlig;bare 
Proze&szlig;gr&ouml;&szlig;en bestimmen, die eine vertiefte Einsicht 
in das Proze&szlig;geschehen erm&ouml;glichen.</LI>

<LI>Vorbereitung experimenteller Studien:<BR>
Experimentelle Untersuchungen in der Humanleistungsphysiologie sind 
&auml;u&szlig;erst zeit- und kostenintensiv. Hier bietet ein 
mathematisches Modell die M&ouml;glichkeit einer besseren Vorbereitung 
derartiger Studien, so da&szlig; die Freiheitsgrade eines Studiendesigns 
wirkungsvoll eingeschr&auml;nkt werden k&ouml;nnen.</LI>

<LI>Nachbereitung experimenteller Studien:<BR>
Experimentelle Befunde k&ouml;nnen durch Simulationsstudien erg&auml;nzt 
werden und zu einer umfassenderen Interpretation der Befunde oder auch 
weiterf&uuml;hrenden Hypothesen f&uuml;hren.</LI> 
</UL>

In der Arbeitsgruppe werden zu den drei genannten Anwendungsschwerpunkten 
Untersuchungen zur verkopplungs-orientierten Modellbildung und 
Identifikation von leistungsspezifischen Modellparametern des 
Belastungsstoffwechsels durchgef&uuml;hrt. Prim&auml;re Zielsetzung
ist die Entwicklung eines "Proze&szlig;beobachters", der die individuelle 
Beobachtung interner, nicht me&szlig;barer Proze&szlig;gr&ouml;&szlig;en 
w&auml;hrend der routinem&auml;&szlig;igen Belastungsuntersuchung 
erm&ouml;glicht und als Grundlage einer differenzierteren Diagnostik 
genutzt werden kann.<BR>

<H3>Wissensbasierte Systeme</H3>

Prim&auml;res Ziel der Entwicklung wissensbasierter Systeme ist die 
Modellierung abgrenzbarer Wissensbereiche des Menschen in einem 
rechnergest&uuml;tzten System. Von besonderem Interesse sind wissensbasierte 
Systeme f&uuml;r Entscheidungsaufgaben, die nicht in analytisch geschlossener
Form oder mit Hilfe numerischer Verfahren in ein quantitatives Modell
(Berechnungsproblem) &uuml;berf&uuml;hrt werden k&ouml;nnen.<BR>

Im Bereich der Pr&auml;ventiv- und Leistungsmedizin existieren zahlreiche diagnostische 
Entscheidungsaufgaben, die bisher manuell gel&ouml;st werden. 
Hierzu z&auml;hlt das Erfassen und Bewerten von Daten, die das 
k&ouml;rperliche Leistungsverm&ouml;gen bzw. Leistungsbeeintr&auml;chtigungen
kennzeichnen, ebenso wie das Festlegen geeigneter Handlungsempfehlungen 
durch einen Therapie- oder Trainingsplan. F&uuml;r die Automatisierung 
derartiger Aufgabenstellungen werden in der Arbeitsgruppe moderne Verfahren 
der Wissensverarbeitung untersucht.

Dabei entstanden bisher zwei konkrete Systementwicklungen:<BR>
Einerseits ein System zur pr&auml;ventivmedizinischen Trainingssteuerung 
in wichtigen Breitensportarten und andererseits ein System zur
Laktat-Leistungsdiagnostik im Leistungssport (Spielsportarten). 
Das notwendige sportmedizinische und trainingsmethodische Wissen wird 
jeweils explizit in einer sogenannten Wissensbasis abgsspeichert.
Die Systementwicklungen wurden in einer Kooperation von Ingenieuren,
Medizinern, Sport- und Ern&auml;hrungwissenschaftlern durchgef&uuml;hrt.


<H3>Kooperationspartner</H3>

Zus&auml;tzlich zur hochschulinternen Zusammenarbeit mit dem 
Sportmedizinischen Institut werden die Forschungs- und Entwicklungsarbeiten 
zu wissensbasierten Systemen in hochschul&uuml;bergreifender Kooperation mit

<H2>Forschung im Bereich Fuzzy-Control</H2>

Seit Mitte 1991 werden im Fachgebiet Regelungstechnik Untersuchungen
zur Wirkungsweise und zum Einsatz von <I>Fuzzy-Logik</I> in Regelungen und
Proze&szlig;f&uuml;rungskonzepten durchgef&uuml;hrt.<P>

Hauptziel der theoretischen Arbeiten ist es, die heute &uuml;bliche
Vorgehensweise, eine Fuzzy- Komponente intuitiv f&uuml;r eine
Einzelapplikation zu entwerfen, durch systematische und
verallgemeinerbare Entwurfsrichtlinien zu ersetzen. Dieses betrifft
sowohl die innere Struktur und die Parameter der Fuzzy-Logik-Einheit
als auch deren Integration in ein Regelkonzept, f&uuml;r die sich die
Anwendung von <I>Fuzzy-Hybrid-Strukturen</I> (Kombination von
Fuzzy-Komponenten und konventionellen Reglern) als besonders g&uuml;nstig
erweist. Besondere Bedeutung kommt hierbei der Frage nach dem
dynamischen Verhalten und der Stabilit&auml;t eines Regelkreises mit
Fuzzy-Komponente zu.<P>

Anwendungsorientierte Arbeiten werden im Bereich der Kraftfahrzeugtechnik 
(Fahrwerksregelung, Innenraumtemperaturregelung, Robotik)
und der Verfahrenstechnik (Regelung von Bioreaktoren, Regelung eines 
Ozonungsreaktors) als Kooperationsprojekte durchgef&uuml;hrt. Sowohl
die breite Streuung der Anwendungsgebiete als auch die Kontakte zur 
Industrie erlauben eine Einsch&auml;tzung der M&ouml;glichkeiten und Grenzen 
beim praktischen Einsatz von <I>Fuzzy-Logik</I>.<P>

<H2>Automation in the field of polymer extrusion </H2>

<H3>The department </H3>

Mainly, the Department of Control Enineering deals with the automation 
of technical processes. Especially in the file of polymer processing 
(extrusion), the researchers can look back on many years of experience, 
an experience that comprises theoretical works in mathematical modeling 
but also cooperations with the industry in the field of process control. 
Thus, the research is done in cooperation with the industry, with 
research organizations and other university departments.<P>

<IMG SRC="../GIF/extdv3.gif"><P>

<B>Figure</B>: Single screw extruder<P>


<H3>Research in extrusion</H3>

Machines for polymer extrusion  - cf. figure - form an important 
class of technical processes. Supposingly, about 40% of the polymer 
raw materials have gone through an extrusion process before finally 
being processed. <P>
The automation is concerned with the starting up, the holding, 
and the control of an operating mode that has been set according to 
technical aspects; thus the highest quality possible and a high 
production rate can be guaranteed.<BR>
In consideration of these aspects, especially methods for process 
control and for adaptive control have been developed in recent years. 
Besides, the mathematical modeling and the simulation has gained in 
importance because the development of complex automation concepts 
entails the development of more exact mathematical description. 
The projects are presented in the following. <P>


<H3> Modeling and simulation of dynamic extrusion processes </H3>

A deep knowledge of the dynamic processes is required for an 
automation of extrusion systems that surpasses the latest state of 
engineering. Starting from a modular model concept, a model library 
is being created, which is based on mathematical modeling for 
extrusion processes so that large parts of the process can be modeled 
and simulated. <BR> 
At the same time, a modeling and simulation environment - 
<A HREF="cam_info.html"><IMG SRC="../GIF/hand.gif"></A><I>CAMEx</I> - 
is developed, which supports the engineer with his/her modeling attempts. 
This is done on SUN workstations (Sparcstation 20, multi-processor system) 
to meet the computation required for these simulations.<P>


<H3>Identification and adaptive control</H3>

The exact control of the temperature as the most important process 
parameter is crucial for the product quality. Based on a new and 
robust identification method within a closed-loop control, 
it has been possible to develop an adaptive temperature controller 
which meets the high demands concerning the transient behavior and 
the stationary accuracy.<BR>
This has been done by means of a laboratory extruder belonging to 
the department.<P>


<H3>Process control by means of pattern recognition</H3>

A special problem at controlling the extrusion process is that a 
direct measurement of many quality features is not possible. 
Therefore we have developed a method that allows statements about 
the process state and the product quality in consideration of the 
dynamic behavior of the most important system variables, 
i.e. the melting temperature and the extrusion pressure. <BR>

The developed procedure uses methods of digital signal processing 
and pattern recognition. We were able to prove a high conformity 
of the computed process features and the actual physical values.

<H2>CAMEx - An experimental tool for computer-aided modeling 
in the field of polymer extrusion</H2>
<HR>

<H3>Automation problems in the field of polymer extrusion</H3>

Machines for polymer extrusion form an important class of technical 
processes. Supposingly, about 40% of the polymer raw materials have 
gone through an extrusion process before finally being processed. 
Figure 1 shows a frequently used class of extruders. <P>

<IMG SRC="../GIF/extdv3.gif"><P>

<B>Figure 1:</B> Single screw extruder<P>
 
The automation is concerned with the starting up, the holding, 
and the control of an operating mode that has been set according 
to processing aspects; thus the highest quality possible and a high 
production rate can be guaranteed. For the development and the 
optimization of automation concepts the modeling and the simulation 
of the dynamic extrusion process is gaining in importance.<BR>

Athough there are already a number of various simulation systems for 
dynamic processes, consistent model libraries for the field of extrusion 
are not yet available, so that today dynamic processes are rarely analyzed; 
this can also be attributed to the great process knowledge that 
is required for the modeling and the high expenditure of time.<P>

<H3>Tasks and objectives of the research group in the 
Departement of Control Engineering </H3>

The research group deals with the development of a tool for 
computer-aided modeling of dynamic extrusion processes. 
This tool shall be used for the design and administration of libraries, 
regardless of the simulation platform. The project's aim was to 
realize a system
<UL>
<LI> that supports the engineer with the different modeling tasks,
<LI> that sees to an automated execution of  error-prone subprocesses 
(programming, algebraic transformations),
<LI> that allows a reuse of mdel components and thus 
<LI> reduces the expenditure from the technical process to its 
simulation and analysis.
</UL>

<H3>Development of model libraries</H3>

Currently, this tool is used by the Department of Control Engineering 
to model various subprocesses of extrusion systems and to collect 
them in model libraries. These libraries comprise technical system 
components as well as control elements and systems.<BR>

The modeling itself is based on certain conceptions, which can be 
summed up by the notion of interconnection-oriented modeling [1,7]. 
The first step at modeling an extrusion process is the hierarchical 
structuring of the process, in order to apply the modeling to simpler 
subcomponents.<BR>

These submodels are set up in a modular way; the mathematical 
descriptions of these subcomponents may however vary.
The models are stored in a library and can be combined again to a 
process model by coupling the components (aggregation). 
The linking of the model components conforms with physical couplings 
of the corresponding subprocesses, e.g. conservation of mass.<P>

<H3>Computer-aided modeling by means of <I>CAMEx</I></H3>

Since these steps are quite complex, time-consuming, and error-prone, 
a computer tool (<I>CAMEx</I>) has been developed for modeling, 
simulating, and analyzing extrusion processes; this tool is mainly 
based on the computer algebra system Maple V (Release 3). 
Figure 2 shows the schematic structure of the tool and demonstrates 
the diverse fields of application for computer algebra.<P>

<IMG SRC="../GIF/camev3.gif"><P>

<B>Figure 2</B>: 
Structure of a modeling environment <I>CAMEx</I> in version 3.0.<P>

A declarative description of the model, which is independent of the 
simulation system, is a fundamental feature for the use of a computer 
algebra system, as well as the possibility of making complex algebraic 
transformations. Since <I>CAMEx</I>is used like a tool box under Maple, 
the modeler can easily extend his/her environment, e.g. by analysis tools. 
At the same time, a code generation in C or Fortran is possible so that 
links with existing analysis or simulation software (e.g. Matlab/Simulink) 
can be realized easily.<P>

The modeling envrionment CAMEx is based on the following concepts:
<UL>
<LI> use of object-oriented concepts (classification, setting up 
hierarchies by means of abstraction and aggregation, modularity, 
capsulation),

available on SUN-workstations in the Department of Control Engineering. 
A PC version for the operating system LINUX is being developed.<P>

<H3>Used software and hardware</H3>

In order to realize the different methods for modeling and simulation 
with regard to software, UNIX workstations by SUN (SPARCstation 20), 
which are operated under Solaris 2.4 and OpenWindows 3.4, 
are generally used. In addition to corresponding compilers and 
OpenWindows service programs the programs Matlab 4.2c and 
Maple V Release 3 are available for the visualization of the 
simulations and as a basis of the modeling tool, respectively. 
In the future, the integrated documentation and implementation of the 
model components will be based on an HTML format, which can be read 
by means of a WWW browser, e.g. Mosaic or netscape.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Sponsoring / Cooperations</H3>

The model library is developed in cooperation with 
Prof. Dr.-Ing. S. Dormeier from the FH Bielefeld, 
Departement of Control Engineering, within the frame of a

<H2>Diagnostic problem solution in preventive and 
high-performance medicine </H2>
  
<H3>Research in the field of medicine/biology</H3> 

The research activities in medicine/biology of the Department of 
Control Engineering comprises the application of methods from system 
theory to non-technical problems in sports medicine - research as 
well as pratice. According to interdisciplinarity there exists a 
close cooperation between the Department of Control Engineering 
and the Institute of Sports Medicine (Prof. Dr. med. H. Liesen) 
at the University of Paderborn. <P>

There are two main fields of research :
<UL>
<LI> Development of new procedures for performance diagnostics 
by using system-theoretical methods of quantitative modeling and 
simulation (model-based diagnostics)
<LI> Automation of routine-like crucial tasks within the scope 
of the medical treatment practice on preventive and high-performance 
medicine by means of modern methods (knowledge-based systems)
</UL> 

The research and development projects are performed in cooperation 
with external scientists and are financed by means of third-party 
sponsoring.

<H3>Model-based performance diagnostics </H3>  

The modeling and simulation of dynamic procedures in the field of 
technical and non-technical fields of applications has gained in 
importance during the last years. The development has been advanced 
by methodological progresses in mathematical description of 
complex systems, as well as by the rapid progress in computer science. 
Thus, known problems can be solved much easier or can at least be 
investigated. The simulation science has therefore reached  
the status of an important "sectional technology" that concerns 
more and more different disciplines.  So far, mathematical 
models  - e.g. about strain and adjusting reactions of the 
metabolism - have not yet played an important rule in preventive and 
high-performance medicine. Still, these models supply significant 
theoretical knowlege and may thus complement experimental research 
and investigation methods. This is especially true considering 
the following aspects:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Studies about internal processes: mathematical models allow the 
calculation of behavior within a process.
In the sense of model-based diagnostics process quantities that 
cannot be measured can be determined in addition, which do then 
allow a deeper view into the process.
<P>
</P></LI>
<LI>Preparation of experimantal studies: 
Experimental research in the field of human performance physiology 
involve a high proportion of cost and time. A mathematical model 
allows a better preparation of such studies so that the degrees 
of freedom concerning studies design can be efficiently restricted. <P>
</P></LI>
<LI>Evaluation of experimental studies: 
Experimental results can be complemented by simulation studies an 
may lead to a comrehensive interpretation and further hypotheses.<P></P></LI> 
</UL>According to the main fields of interest mentioned above, 
the research group makes investigations on modeling and optimization 
of the "load metabolism". The main objective is the design of 
a "process observer" which allows the individual observation of 
internal processes that cannot be measured, during a routine "load" check, 
and which can be used as a base of a differentiated diagnostic.
<P>
</P>

<H2>Knowledge-based systems </H2>  
The modeling of limited fields of human knowledge in a 
computer-aided system - this is the principal objective of the 
design of knowledge-based systems.
Knowlege-based systems are especially interesting for decisions that 
cannot be formulated as a quantitative model, neither in an 
analytically closed form nor by means of numerical methods 
(computational problem).
<P>
In the field of preventive and high-performance medicine there are a 
lot of diagnostic decisions to be taken, which so far have been solved 
by hand. This comprises the acquisition and valuation of data which 
characterize the physical fitness and/or decrease in vitality, 
as well as the definition of recommendations by a therapy or training plan; 
in order to automate those kinds of tasks the work group analyzes modern 
procedures of knowlege-based systems. </P>
<P>
At doing this there are by now two concrete system developments: 
in preventive medicine, there is a system for training control for 
the most important mass sports on the one hand, and a performance 
diagnostics of lactate for the high-performance sports (team sports). 
The necessary knowlege concerning sports medicine and training methods 
is stored separately in a so-called knowledge base.
The systems have been developed by cooperating engineers, physicians, 
sports researchers, and nutritionists.</P>
<P>

<H2>Cooperation partners</H2> 

In addition to the cooperation between departments of the university, 
the research and development concerning knowledge-based systems is 
done in cooperation with the Sportmedizinisches Institut, 
Universitt Dortmund (Prof. Dr.med. K. V&ouml;lker) and the Institut 
fr Prvention und Nachsorge (IPN), Cologne (Dr. D. Lagerstroem). 
In the field of model-based performance diagnostic there is a cooperation 
with the Institut f&uuml;r Kreislaufforschung und Sportmedizin, 
Deutsche Sporthochschule K&ouml;ln (Prof. Dr. med. A. Mader) and 
the chair for Sportmedizin, Ruhr Universit&auml;t
Bochum (Prof. Dr. med. H. Heck). The above projects are sponsored 
by the BAYER AG (Leverkusen), the BAMER Ersatzkasse (Wuppertal), 
the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Bonn) and the Verein zur 
F&ouml;rderung der sportmedizinischen Forschung e.V. (Paderborn).

<H2>Research in the field of Fuzzy Control</H2>

Since 1991 the Department of Control Engineering is doing research 
about the mechanisms and the use of <I>fuzzy logics</I> in control 
systems and concepts for process control units.<P>

Our main objective is to replace the current proceeding, i.e. the 
intuitive design of a fuzzy component for a single application, 
by systematic and generalizing design directions. This concerns the 
internal structure and the parameters of the fuzzy logics unit as 
well as their integration in a concept of regulations; to realize 
this project, the appplication of <I>hybrid fuzzy structures</I> 
(combination of fuzzy components and conventional controllers) proves 
especially effective. The dynamic behavior and the stability of a 
control circuit with a fuzzy component thus plays an important part.<P>

There are cooperative projects for application-oriented research in 
the field of motorcar electronics (chassis control, indoor temperature 
control, robotics) and of process engineering (control of bio reactors, 
control of a ozone reactor). The complex fields of application as 
well as contacts with the industry alows the estimation of the 
possibilities and limits concerning the practical use of 
<I>fuzzy logics</I>.<P>

Principal long-range support is derived from a $50-million gift from the Annenberg Foundation as part of Walter H. Annenberg's $500-million "challenge to the nation" to improve America's schools.  All of the Institute's funding is expended on programs under its direct sponsorship or on joint projects with collaborating organizations .  The Institute does not make individual grants to outside organizations or programs.<p>The work of the Institute is guided by a board of overseers appointed by the President of Brown University.  Its first director is Theodore R. Sizer, formerly dean of the Graduate School of Education and headmaster at Phillips Academy, Andover, and, since 1984, professor of education at Brown.  Dr. Sizer is the founder and chairman of the <a href="../../ces/">Coalition of Essential Schools</a>.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="principles"><hr><h2>Guiding Principles</h2>The work of the Institute is guided by three fundamental principles.  Partners inalliance with the Institute are in agreement with these principles.<p><h3>Every child is special and every child can and must learn.</h3>This dictum cannot be a mere slogan; it is the duty of schools to make good learning happen for ALL children, without exception.  To do this, schools must be prepared to know each student well, and to teach her in ways appropriate to her individual development.  Schools are for educating, not for sorting the presumed haves from the apparent have-nots.  If resources beyond the school are necessary to assist the pupil and his family or to prepare the young child to enter school, they must be marshaled.<p><h3>Rigorous intellectual performance is expected of every student</h3>Academic standards must be high for each child, and each child's performance must be presented through the active demonstration of real work - public exhibitions, portfolios and projects - not only displayed but actively explained and defended as well.  Intellectual habits are the ultimate goal - young people who live their lives in thoughtful, actively informed ways.  To promote these habits, schools must conduct themselves as models of a thoughtful life and must commit themselves to helping students develop such habits, however long it may take for any particular student.<p><h3>Educational policy in support of each child's learning must reinvigorate democracy and authority at the child's immediate community level.</h3><p>Schools live in a "policy context" of budgets, laws, regulations and codes which affect their efforts to reform, but they are even more profoundly influenced by their local community cultures and the blessings or hardships of their immediate neighborhoods.  Education policy must not merely tolerate but actively elicit the participation of parents and community members in the work of school reform; their voices must be heard by the schools and must carry authority.  Communities which are engaged in the happenings of their schools are more likely to support those schools than to hold them suspect or resist efforts to change.  Further, teachers are more likely to stay in schools where they have legitimate authority over the substance and standards of their trade, and it is teachers who ultimately set the tone for learning in the classroom.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="how"><hr><h2>How Will the Institute Work?</h2>Several key notions will characterize the work of the institute during its early years.  All of its work will be attentive to one or more of these ideas.<p><h3>"Fault line"</h3>The Institute seeks purposely and self-consciously to straddle the between educational theory and classroom practice.  The work of its professional staff will focus on ways in which theoretical <i>concepts</i> about teaching and learning and the everyday <i>realities</i> of schooling inform and offset each other.  It is only at this often controversial and troubled "fault line" between theory and practice that truly substantive change can emerge.<p><h3>"Alliances"</h3>Given the difficulty of carrying forward serious education reform, unity among those engaged in it is not merely desirable but essential.  Unity, however, does not mean group-think: reasonable people can constructively disagree about important matters, even as they agree on fundamental directions in which to proceed. Alliances are central to the progress of Authentic reform.  The Institute will be clear about its own basic principles and aggressive in making alliances, bringing together in a variety of collaborations those who share key convictions and are making substantive contributions to the shape of school reform.<h3>"Interwoven Strands"</h3>Everything of importance in a school affects everything else of importance.  This truism has been demonstrated time and again in school reform.  Pedagogy affects the daily schedule, which affects how students work, which affects assessment, which affects standards, which affect policy.  So it is in the school reform movement as well.  The change process does not proceed neatly, element by element.  Each strand is interwoven with every other strand: professional development and research, assessment and technology, leadership and student achievement, policy and pedagogy.  The Institute is designed to bring the various elements of the school reform work together and to pay attention to their influences and interactions.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="focuses"><hr><h2>Focuses of Institute Activities</h2>The Institute will focus its work in four broad areas.  Each of these areas will "straddle the fault fine" between theory and practice; each will involve Alliances among several education reform efforts, and each will address a number of the interwoven strands within the educational structure.<p><h3>A Cadre of "Lead" Schools</h3>The school reform movement must have "places" - schools and clusters of schools and communities - that can demonstrate a dramatically more appropriate and more effective form of learning for America's young citizens.  Practically speaking, this means amassing at least 100 "lead" schools which, in their daily practice, unequivocally testify to the power of reformed schooling.  These exemplar schools will emerge from a number of kindred reform efforts, including the <a href="../../ces/">Coalition of Essential Schools</a>.  They will ideally be clustered - either geographically or by some conceptual similarity - so as to support and encourage each other's efforts.<p>The Institute believes that schools must be viewed in the full context of their surrounding communities.  Hence, there will be a concerted effort to include the agencies and activities beyond the school walls that affect youngsters, particularly low income youngsters, without weakening the reform movement's emphasis on a serious intellectual education for all children.<p>Two examples already in place are the <a href="http://www.naschools.org/greatsch/atlas/atlas.htm">ATLAS Communities</a> project and the Center for Collaborative Education.  ATLAS (a collaboration among Harvard Project Zero, the School Development Project at Yale, Education Development Center in Newton, MA and the <a href="../../ces/">Coalition of Essential Schools</a>) involves three school systems, in Maine, Maryland and Virginia, in an innovative effort to develop K-12 pathways.  The effort includes work in curriculum and pedagogy, assessment, community involvement, leadership style, policy and more.  The Center for Collaborative Education in New York City is a network of elementary, middle and high schools that provides local support and provocation to more than two dozen Essential schools.  The Center is also working with the New York City school department to create "campuses" of small schools housed within very large school buildings.<p><h3>A National Faculty of School Reform Practitioners</h3>Sustained, rich and complex education reform will not arise merely from a theoretical "model" or from legislation or regulation.  It will arise only when a large group of well-informed, committed and like-minded folk move in concert to create and support institutions that serve youngsters well.  The Institute will sponsor a nationwide group of leading professionals - teachers, principals and others concerned with children - who, while working in different and widely dispersed communities, will promote a common idea of better schooling for children than currently exists.<p>To create such a "national faculty," the Institute will seek out hundreds of outstanding practitioners affiliated with like-minded reform efforts to serve as exemplars and coaches for the school reform movement.  They will work primarily on changing classroom practice and on strategies to enable whole-school change.  This faculty will be brought together or "connected" both for information-sharing and for professional development.  These "faculty meetings" will take place not only through such traditional devices as conferences and publications, but also through electronic communications and interactive teleconferencing.<p>Various prototypes for such a national faculty already exist on a small scale.  The National Center for the Restructuring of Education, Schools and Teaching (NCREST) at Columbia has sponsored a collaboration - the Four Seasons project - among Foxfire, Harvard Project Zero and the <a href="../../ces/">Coalition of Essential Schools</a> to train teachers affiliated with those projects in alternative assessment methods and prepare them to address the larger policy implications.  A variety of "centers" across the country - among them, the Philadelphia Teaching and Learning Collaborative, the Southern Maine Partnership, the Chicago Forum for School Change - provide settings for professional exchanges and cross-school support for faculty involved in school reform.  The 220 members of the National Re:Learning Faculty, made up of practitioners and other education professionals affiliated with Essential schools, have drawn on their experience in classrooms, districts and school boards to make significant contributions to the spread and encouragement of the school reform movement.<p>Interactive satellite teleconferencing for professional development on school reform has already been piloted by Thayer High School, in Winchester, NH.  Once a month for a two-year period, "Here, Thayer and Everywhere" offered faculty presentations and student work from a variety of schools involved in the reform movement.  A direct outgrowth of that effort, called the Educators' Guild (e.g. for short), is being set up by the Thayer project developers under the auspices of the Institute and will begin programming in late 1994.<p><h3>Research and Analysis of Ideas on School Reform</h3>The pressures and imperatives of the real world of school too often have little influence upon the broad research agenda of our universities.  At the same time, much university research, however elegant in its own right has little constructive application to the real world of growing up and learning.  A unique and key role for the Institute will be to bring together these two important worlds to give a rigorous and sustained underpinning to the practical activities of the Institute.  Hence, its work will be along the "fault line" between them, where practice can inform theory and theory, practice.<p>Such interactive inquiries will necessarily be long term, not simply "high profile" meetings but sustained gatherings over time.  The Institute's research is deliberately designed to connect closely and in a continuing forum the inevitably complex (and "messy") world of real communities and real children and real schools with the world of academic (and artificially "tidy") disciplines such as developmental and social psychology, cognitive science and philosophy.<p>The Institute will expand upon the rich research base already laid down by various school reform efforts, such as Yale professor James Comer's work on child development, associated with his School Development Program; Howard Gardner's work on assessment, intelligences and the nature of understanding, played out in Harvard Project Zero; the innovative curriculum development at Education Development Center; and the <a href="../../ces/">Coalition of Essential Schools</a>' work with schools in the New York State Compact for Learning on planning backwards, Exhibitions and the digital portfolio.  Equally important new areas - for instance, the opportunities represented by the astonishing diversity (racial, ethnic, intellectual) among the American student body - will be explored using research-and-action techniques, such as those developed for the Coalition's School Change Study in which three university research teams and five school sites worked together to both understand and forward the process of school change.<p>The Institute is also embarked upon a program of seminars, or "working parties," to bring together practitioners, researchers and other school reformers over specific topics relevant to reform.  One such working party, co-sponsored by the Educational Testing Service, is currently investigating accountability-system design at the school and district levels.  A Writing Seminar, in collaboration with the National Writing Project aims to help teachers in changing schools give voice to their experiences.  The ATLAS Seminar, an outgrowth of the ATLAS Communities project, brings together researchers and practitioners from the partner organizations and the school sites to apply their collective expertise to topics central to school reform.  Working groups will meet regularly for three years to examine issues of curriculum, professional development, personalization and organizational change.<p><h3>A Forum for Debate on School Reform, its Implications and Progress</h3> The Institute will create a national, nonpartisan forum purposely designed to accommodate the pluralistic clamor of voices in the American school reform debate, This forum will highlight the most current and wide-ranging information about reform and will serve as a resource for legislators, school board members and departments of education - thereby influencing local, state and national strategies for education - and for the public at large whom those officials serve.<p>Underlying and informing this debate will be the keeping of a "national school reform record" to take careful stock of how school reform is playing out nationally.  A small staff at the Institute will draw upon research and data collection already under way across the country, as well as designing focused studies of its own.  This "record" will periodically be made public by means of a printed report and a national (and eventually) international teleconference.  The country urgently needs an independent, nonpartisan voice of this kind that will address the issues, concerns and progress of reform from the vantage points of schools.<p>In addition to concerning itself with the short-term cross-section of "what is happening now," the Institute staff will attend to the long-term consequences and the "horizon" of school change.  To this end, they will explore the possibility of a longitudinal study of young people in fundamentally redesigned schools (matched with youngsters in "traditional" schools) in order to provide the long-view assessment of the effectiveness of such schools.<p>Helping to shape supportive "policy contexts" for school reform is of particular importance to the Institute.  The Institute, in collaboration with the A. Alfred Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions at Brown and the Education Commission of the States, has recently convened a small group of policy "activists" to explore strategies for building more local flexibility into Goals 2000 and the state plans it is engendering.<p>All of this work will necessitate the evolution of a sophisticated public communications capacity, involving telecommunications and the print media on a much larger and more carefully planned scale than has been possible to date.  It will allow the Institute to speak to the public at large, as well as to smaller forums of political and professional leaders, about the state of the school reform movement.  In so doing, it will provide an independent, informed and thoughtful basis for public consideration of education policy and practice in our nation's schools.<p><hr><h3>Contact:</h3>The Annenberg Institute for School Reform<br>Box 1985<br>Brown University<br>Providence, RI 02912<P>tel.

<H2>A Description of the Annenberg Challenge:</H2>

<P>On December 17,1993, president Bill Clinton announced the single largest
gift ever made to American public education: a five-year, half-billion-dollar
challenge grant for American public school reform. This gift, made by the
Honorable Walter A. Annenberg, former U.S. ambassador to Great Britain,
provided a badly needed boost to the nation's public schools and to the
efforts of all those endeavoring to improve public school education --
teachers, administrators, policy makers, educational reformers, community
groups, business representatives, and foundations. </P>

<P>The Annenberg grant has been termed &quot;A Challenge to the Nation&quot;
because it presents the country with a moral, political, and financial
challenge. Morally, it reminds us of our commitment as a democratic nation
to educate all students well. Politically, it calls for unity around the
importance of rearing and teaching America's youth. Financially, it asks
that local communities increase their investment in public education and
match Mr. Annenberg's gift. </P>

<P>In the months since the White House announcement, the Annenberg Challenge
has come to include several components: </P>

<UL>
<LI>grants to the New American Schools Development Corporation (NASDC),
the Education Commission of the States (ECS), and the Annenberg Institute
for School Reform to carry forward their respective programs; </LI>

<LI>sizable matching grants to some of the nation's largest urban school
systems, underscoring Mr. Annenberg's fervent plea that America not abandon
the children in their care because the systems are too big, too problem-ridden
-- too beyond repair; </LI>

<LI>a rural initiative aimed at stimulating good, genuinely rural schools
throughout the country; </LI>

<LI>an arts initiative that uses arts education as a fulcrum for school
reform, with partners and sites in both urban and rural America. </LI>
</UL>

<P>As of October 1995, virtually all of Mr. Annenberg's extraordinary gift
has been accounted for. Approximately $264 million has been awarded in
matching grants for urban, rural, and arts-driven school reform, promising
to generate an additional $443 million in new, public and private matching
investments. A total of $113.1 million has been awarded in outright grants
to NASDC, KS, and the Annenberg Institute for School Reform. Proposals
from a handful of remaining sites, which are nearing completion, will utilize
the roughly $125 million remaining from Annenberg's original pledge and
promise to generate another $200 to $250 million in matching funds. </P>

<P>The sheer size and scope of the Challenge program has captured public
attention, yet other singular characteristics distinguish it as well: </P>

<UL>
<LI>The Challenge seeks to stimulate bold reform plans centered on &quot;where
the action is&quot;: in those communities, classrooms, schools, and networks
where the resources made available by the grant will powerfully upgrade
the quality of student learning and the daily life in public schools. Those
seeking support from the Challenge have been instructed to keep a relentless
focus on children and schools. </LI>

<LI>While the approaches for stimulating and sustaining good schools among
Challenge grant recipients vary, the vision of what constitutes a good
school remains constant. In the context of the Challenge, a good school
is one which, in collaboration with its immediate community: (1) arranges
its resources so that each child is known well and then uses this knowledge
to shape each child's schooling, (2) sets uncompromisingly high academic
expectations for all children, (3) respectfully assesses the progress of
each, student by means of a careful and-continuing review of the child's
actual work, and (4) exhibits daily the ideals of acting as a democratic
and thoughtful learning community. </LI>

<LI>The Challenge encourages whole-school reform through partnerships,
in which individual schools group themselves into clusters or K-12 networks
and then pair with an external organization experienced in facilitating
change. </LI>

<LI>Although school districts have participated in the planning process
in the cities invited to submit a proposal, the plans that have emerged
for each city are the product of broad-based collaboration involving local
foundations, universities, community groups, business leaders, people working
in schools, and those active in local reform. </LI>

<LI>All grants have been awarded to an independent, nonprofit entity and
not to local school authorities. Overseeing the implementation of each
grant is a newly constituted governing board, composed locally from the
same array of groups who engaged in the planning. It is these local Challenge
governing boards that decide which schools and external partners receive
grant support within their site. </LI>

<LI>Because a basic premise of the Challenge is that strong community coalitions
are necessary to ensure sustained progress, local elected and appointed
officials must pledge their support for the Challenge publicly and must
promise to help remove obstacles to school autonomy. </LI>

<LI>Unlike the usual funding pattern in which money is given to groups
who, in turn, recruit schools interested in their own particular reforms,
Challenge money flows to schools that demonstrate the capacity and willingness
to reform and that then recruit organizations to support their efforts.
</LI>
</UL>

<P> <A NAME="grants"></A></P>

<H3>Outright Grants to Organizations</H3>

<P>The first of three major organizations to receive support from Annenberg's
$500 million pledge for school reform was the New American Schools Development
Corporation (NASDC). Begun in 1991 and led by David Kearns, former chief
executive officer of Xerox, NASDC is a private, nonpartisan, nonprofit
organization that supports nine school &quot;design teams,&quot; or collaborative
reform projects, promoting innovations in instruction, governance, and
the use of technology. A $50 million Annenberg grant allowed NASDC to complete
the piloting of these nine &quot;break the mold&quot; designs in 150 urban,
suburban, and rural schools in nineteen states. </P>

<P>The Challenge has provided an additional grant of $13.1 million to NASDC
and to the Education Commission of the States (ECS) to work as partners
in expanding the dissemination of the NASDC school designs. The mission
of the ECS, a bipartisan, nationwide, nonprofit partnership between governors,
state legislators, state education officials, and other educational leaders,
is to develop the supportive policy context necessary for ensuring serious
change within the educational system. The recognition that changing schools
-- the goal of NASDC -- requires altering attitudes and policies that impede
school change -- a goal of ECS -- makes this relationship unique and complementary.
In this dissemination effort, NASDC and ECS have received grants of $6.6
and $6.5 million, respectively. Their goal is to transform a minimum of
30 percent of the schools in ten jurisdictions (which include eight cities
and two states) into &quot;high performance&quot; designs. </P>

<P>A third outright grant, of $50 million, was made to the National Institute
of School Reform, established in October 1993 at Brown University. This
grant enables the Institute to expand its mission and provides it with
long-term support. In honor of Mr. Annenberg's gift, the Institute was
renamed the Annenberg Institute for School Reform. The Annenberg Institute
grows out of the ten-year, national experience of the Coalition of Essential
Schools, one of the country's most extensive and well-known school reform
organizations, led by Professor Theodore R. Sizer. </P>

<P>Three key ideas inform the work of the Annenberg Institute: (1) the
&quot;fault line&quot; where theory and practice intersect is the juncture
where the most critical changes occur; (2) all aspects of schools life
-- including policy, pedagogy, leadership, scheduling, and student achievement
-- are interwoven and must all be addressed to bring about serious change;
(3) forming alliances and working collaboratively are essential for achieving
fundamental, system-wide reform. Guided by these ideas, the Institute is
dedicated to promoting, sponsoring, and researching a variety of school
reform efforts. It is committed to building an ever-expanding cadre of
exceptional leaders in educational reform as well as a forum for them to
share their ideas. It carries out collaborative research projects that
bridge the gap between theory and practice. Finally, it serves as a national
forum for the debate on changing schools. </P>

<H3>Major Urban Projects</H3>

<P>In accordance with Mr. Annenberg's original mandate, the main emphasis
of the Challenge has been on developing and supporting reform initiatives
in some of the largest urban school districts in the country. The rationale
for this emphasis is that these are the places that have the highest concentration
of students and these have been some of the toughest places to provoke
and sustain reform. They present challenges in the fullest sense of the
word. On the other hand, many of these large urban school districts already
have significant experience with school reform. They provide concrete accomplishments
and coalitions, as well as traditions of corporate and foundation involvement,
upon which the Annenberg Challenge can build. </P>

<P>Nonpartisanship, diversity, and partnerships are hallmarks of the urban
grants awarded to date. While setting firm guidelines about the proposal
planning process, the Annenberg Challenge has welcomed a wide range of
reform strategies -- strategies promoted by well-known reformers (such
as James Comer, Deborah Meier, Hank Levin) as well as ideas of less-well-known
reformers; large, established reform initiatives as well as small ones
just starting up; reform groups within the established system as well as
community activist groups; and top-down as well as bottom-up approaches
to school change. </P>

<P>The major urban districts receiving Challenge grants include New York
City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area.
All of these grants are matching, although requirements differ according
to the determined ability of a site to raise matching funds. In addition,
each grant seeks to transform anywhere from one hundred to three hundred
schools, as well as promote systemic changes in the districts of which
these schools are a part. The grants to Chicago, Los Angeles, and the San
Francisco Bay Area are metropolitan in scope, in recognition that not only
inner-city schools have compelling needs for change. </P>

<H3>Rural Initiative</H3>

<P>While not part of the original vision for the Challenge, the rural initiative
grew out of compelling arguments that a comprehensive, national school
reform effort must include rural schools. Half of the nation's school districts
and a third of the nation's schools are rural, and a quarter of the nation's
students and teachers learn and teach in rural schools. </P>

<P>The $50 million <A HREF="http://www.aisr.brown.edu/aisr/challeng/rural.htm">Rural
Challenge grant</A>, to be matched one-for-one, will benefit over five
hundred schools across America. The objectives of the Rural Challenge and
the guiding principles for achieving them are similar to those of the metropolitan
grants, but the rural initiative also addresses specific needs of rural
schools: for example, to educate students for both an urban and rural future,
to overcome isolation, and to create a rich curriculum that taps the unique
strengths of the surrounding community. A newly created, national, nonprofit
corporation, the Annenberg Rural Challenge, Inc., oversees this initiative.

<H3>Arts Initiative</H3>

<P>The original vision of the Challenge included an arts initiative aimed
at fostering the arts as a vehicle for fundamental school reform and at
enhancing the role of the arts within the school curriculum. In the past
year, collaborations between various groups interested in combining school
improvement and the arts have formed around the country in response to
the Challenge. The Arts in Leaning Consortium, led by the Galef Institute
in Los Angeles and involving several partner organizations around the country,
has received a one-for-one matching grant of $10 million grant for work
it plans to undertake in approximately three hundred schools in eleven
states. Two other proposals for grants in the arts are under review. </P>

<P> <A NAME="new"></A></P>

<H3>New Developments</H3>

<P>Over the past months, the Annenberg Challenge has inspired several smaller
cities to build broad, local coalitions and to develop comprehensive plans
for reform, with or without the support of Challenge funds. As an experiment
to see what can be accomplished in smaller-sized cities, the Challenge
funded an unsolicited proposal this past spring from Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Several factors made this proposal stand out. Chattanooga citizens had
recently voted to consolidate the city and surrounding county school districts
and had tamed to the local public education foundation to create a new
blueprint for schooling. A number of reform initiatives were already under
way at the elementary and secondary levels, and a local foundation promised
$2.5 million as a match to possible Annenberg funds. Within a week after
the announcement that Chattanooga would receive a two-for-one matching
$2.5 million Challenge grant, local citizens and foundations contributed
an additional $3 million in matching funds. This outpouring of civic interest
and support in Chattanooga has led the Annenberg Foundation to consider
in the final stages of the Challenge a new, albeit considerably smaller,
initiative to fund reform in mid-sized cities. </P>

<P> <A NAME="terms"></A></P>

<H3>Grant Terms and Coordination</H3>

<P>Annenberg Challenge grants are for a five-year period. Grant contracts
are with the Annenberg Foundation, and grant payments are tied to progress.
All grant recipients, aside from NASDC, ECS, and the Annenberg Institute
for School Reform, work with an independent third-party evaluator around
a mutually agreed-upon plan for documentation and assessment. No more than
10 percent of grant funds can be spent on administration or overhead. </P>

<P>Serving as a <I>pro bono </I>advisor to the Annenberg Foundation and
the Challenge has been Brown University's president, Vartan Gregorian.
A national coordinator, housed also at Brown University, acts as a liaison
for the Challenge sites and as an information facilitator for the Challenge
and for the public. While each site is responsible for its own evaluation
and documentation, a national assessment of the overall impact of the Challenge
is being launched. Other cross-site programs, aimed at facilitating communication
among sites and at enhancing progress and documentation, are being explored.
</P>

<P>The Annenberg Institute continues to support but not to direct or oversee
the Challenge. It acts as a resource, where appropriate, to Challenge sites
-- for example, by including Challenge participants in its symposia and
conferences and by involving teachers and principals in Challenge schools
in its National School Reform Faculty. </P>

<P><A HREF="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</A></P>

<P> <A NAME="words"></A>
<HR></P>

<P>After presenting his Challenge to the nation, Mr. Annenberg expressed,
with modesty and realism, why this grant is just a beginning: </P>

<P><I>&quot;I do not believe the Annenberg Foundation's $500 million Challenge
grant over five years will do the whole job. This must be a challenge to
the nation</I>... <I>It will take individual giving, corporate giving,
and foundation giving to do the job. I believe those who control sizable
funds should feel an obligation to join this crusade for the betterment
of the</I> <I>country.&quot;</I> </P>

<P>The Annenberg Challenge, in sum, is a call to renew and deepen our nation's
investment in public schools and in the children they serve. It speaks
to the urgency of building broad, nonpartisan coalitions around a shared
set of ideas and plans for school reform and then acting with energy and
optimism. This extraordinary endeavor, in the words of one teacher, is
&quot;a grand occasion for hope.&quot; </P>

The Chicago AnnenbergChallenge will support networks consisting of three or more schoolsand an external partner -- nonprofit organization, a communitygroup, or a university -- as they strive together to improve thequality of teaching and the quality of students' work.  Schoolschosen to participate agree to address the structural issues ofisolation, time, and size: 1) to build relationships with parentsand community; 2) to make instructional time more effective andto make time available for teacher planning and professional development;and 3) to create small learning communities where students arewell-known to their teachers.  A substantial reorganization ofthe Chicago Public Schools' central administration will supportthe project.  Chicago's Challenge initiative also underwritesleadership development for parents and community members and willundertake a joint program for in-service training of new teachersinvolving city and suburban schools.  Supported by a small staff,the Chicago Annenberg Challenge is led by a governing board withoperational support from a twenty-three-member Chicago SchoolReform Collaborative.  Over sixty community organizations participatedin the selection of the latter group.<p><H3>Initial Foundation and Corporate Partners:</H3>Amoco Foundation, Arie and Ida Crown Memorial Fund, Bank of America,Chicago Community Trust, FelPro/Mecklenburger Foundation, FieldFoundation, Harris Bank Foundation, IBM Corporation, Joyce Foundation,Kraft General Foods, Lloyd A.

Unified School District and the eighty-two districtsin surrounding L.A. County.  To foster stability and consistencyfor students, schools participating in LAMP are asked to formclusters, or &quot;families,&quot; that include a high school,middle school, and elementary schools.  Schools within a familywill collaborate to develop and then carry out a plan for restructuringthat includes strategies for creating continuity and sharing amongthe family's schools.  In L.A. County, participating districtsand the schools within these districts are being chosen througha request-for-proposal.  Within the L.A. Unified School District,LEARN, the district's premiere reform organization, is a key partner. Existing LEARN schools as well as schools interested in participating in the reform effort will be invited to form families and submit proposals.  The U.C.L.A. Graduate School of Education, along withother surrounding universities and a diverse array of school reformorganizations and networks (such as the Achievement Council, Educare, High Success Network, ACE, and LAEP), will provide professionaldevelopment and other services to participating schools.

At its heart is the creation of small &quot;communitiesof reamers&quot; throughout Philadelphia's schools.

Instead, it grew from compelling conversationswith various people who argued that no national school reformmovement could be complete unless it included America's ruralschools.  This argument was a winning one: approximately halfof our country's public schools districts and a third of the nation'sschools are rural, as are a quarter of America's teachers andstudents.  Rural schools also possess certain characteristics-- smallness, strong connections with the community, and relativelack of bureaucracy -- that make them especially favorable settingsfor change.<P>The $50 million provide through the Challenge, to be matched one-for-onewith private and public funds, is the single largest private investmentever made for the reform of our nation's rural schools.  In all,more than five hundred rural schools around the country will benefitdirectly from this project.  It is hoped that these schools willplant the seeds for a substantial and lasting rural school reformmovement.  An important outcome of the Rural Challenge will beto overcome the isolation that characterizes so much of ruraleducation.<P>Like the metropolitan grants, the Rural Challenge focuses on fundamentalschoolwide reform, rather than on individual programs and projects,and promotes a similar set of educational principles and schoolcharacteristics.  Schools participating in the Rural Challenge,like their urban counterparts, will work in networks with an externalpartner experienced in promoting K-12 educational change.  However,the Rural Challenge will also encourage and help rural schoolsand communities develop a &quot;pedagogy of place&quot; that takesfull advantage of their rural qualities and that addresses thedual need of preparing students for rural and urban futures.<P>Initially, the Rural Challenge is supporting the activities ofa select group of respected regional and national rural schoolreform networks to strengthen their work, reach out to additionalschools, and work collaboratively with one another.  Concurrently,the Rural Challenge will conduct a search, primarily through asystem of regional &quot;scouts&quot; and teams, to seek out localschools, communities, and organizations that are either alreadyacting in harmony with its vision of creating &quot;genuinelygood, genuinely rural&quot; schools or seriously committed tothis goal.  The hope is to find not only those rural schools thathave gained attention and then to build upon their progress, butalso to find and support those schools whose struggle to becomegood schools has been less visible.<P>Coordinating the Rural Challenge is a new nonprofit organization,led by a board of directors drawn from foundations, universities,and organizations with long-standing involvement in rural education.<P>The Rural Challenge includes a grant awarded to the Blandin Foundationin January 1995, for a program to improve schools and reduce violencein five to eight rural Minnesota communities.  The program's keystrategy is to develop successful models for school change thatemphasize broad ties among families, schools, and communities. Under the terms of the grant, the Annenberg Foundation is providinga one-for-one cash match of $3.25 million, based upon a BlandinFoundation match of $2.5 million and $750,000 from the Universityof Minnesota.  The grant underwrites the work of the Center forSchool Change at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey Instituteof Public Affairs and the newly developed Center for ReducingRural Violence.<P>The process of raising matching funds for the rural initiativeis just beginning.  Besides the Blandin Foundation and the Universityof Minnesota, initial funding partners include the Lyndhurst Foundation,the University of Alabama, and <B>the Minnesota Initiative Funds.</B><p><hr><H3>Contacts:</H3>Paul Nachtigal, Director<br>Annenberg Rural Challenge<br>P.O.

<H3><A NAME="About the Project"></A>About the Project</H3>

<P>The project's beginnings came from the Coalition of Essential Schools'
Exhibitions Project. That project, funded primarily by the IBM&nbsp;Corporation
from 1990 to 1993, investigated how technology could help with the process
of developing exhibitions. Five schools in that study received grants of
equipment from IBM, and developed different approaches that allowed the
students and staff to develop exhibitions in new ways.</P>

<P>One promising idea developed during this time was the Digital Portfolio.
Portfolios have become increasingly widespread in schools throughout the
1990's, and several schools in the project were intrigued with how portfolios
could be useful to students and faculty. Some schools began working with
portfolios, and immediately encountered logistical nightmares; stacks of
papers and folders began to overwhelm some schools. It seemed to make sense
that technology could help here somehow.</P>

<P>IBM funded a second project, from 1994 to 1996, focusing on particular
tools for exhibitions. The project looked at three tools:&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>an &quot;<A HREF="nyac.htm">Assessment Collection</A>,&quot; which
allowed schools to describe exhibitions and alternative assessments developed
in their schools;</LI>

<LI>a &quot;<A HREF="dsp.htm">School Portfolio</A>,&quot; which allows
schools to demonstrate their progress in making reforms; and</LI>

<LI>the &quot;Digital Portfolio,&quot;&nbsp;which allows individual students
to present a richer picture of their knowledge and abilities than traditional
transcripts allow.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Six schools have been involved in the Digital Portfolio project:&nbsp;Eastern
High School in Middletown, Kentucky; <A HREF="http://top.monad.net/~conantpl/school.htm">Thayer
High School</A>&nbsp;in Winchester, New Hampshire; University Heights High
School in the Bronx, New York; and the three schools of the Croton-Harmon
(New York)&nbsp;School District:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.computer.net/croton-harmon/cet/">Carrie
E. Tompkins Elementary School</A>, <A HREF="http://www.computer.net/croton-harmon/pvc/index.html">Pierre
van Cortlandt Middle School</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.computer.net/croton-harmon/chhs/index.html">Croton-Harmon
High School</A>.</P>

<P>Each school received a grant of computer equipment from IBM. During
the study, a pilot group of students in each of the schools built their
own digital portfolios, using customized software, built for each school
by the project's researchers, David Niguidula and Michelle Riconscente.
The researchers then visited the school on a regular basis, helping the
school through this pilot phase, and observing what was required to put
the Digital Portfolio system in place.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Digital Portfolio Software"></A>The Digital Portfolio Software</H3>

<P>The Digital Portfolio software was built using a hypermedia program
called Asymetrix Toolbook. It allows students to record files from any
media -- text, graphics, audio, or video -- and organize those files into
a portfolio &quot;shell.&quot;</P>

<P>The main menu of a Digital Portfolio contains a set of goals established
by the school. These goals represent the school's vision of what a student
should know and be able to do. Over time, the students collect work that
represent their abilities and accomplishments in each of these areas.</P>

<P>A user can examine a student's portfolio by clicking on one of the main
menu's folders or buttons. The software shows a list of portfolio &quot;entries&quot;&nbsp;that
the student (typically in consultation with faculty members)&nbsp;has decided
best demonstrates his or her abilities toward meeting that goal.</P>

<P>When a user clicks on a particular entry, the user will see the student
work on the left side of the screen. Again, this may be in several media.
For example, a lab report might have a write-up of the work, a diagram
showing how the apparatus was set up, and a video showing the experiment
in action. </P>

<P>The entry also contains other information that the school wants to include
for each entry. While these vary from school to school, this information
can include the assignment, a self-reflection (describing why this entry
belongs in the portfolio) and assessments from teachers or other assessors.
Any particular entry can be linked to any number of the main menu's folders.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="Using DP"></A>Using Digital Portfolios for Reform:&nbsp;Examining
a School's Systems</H3>

<P>Putting a digital portfolio system in place requires a great deal of
planning and reflection on what a school wants to accomplish; otherwise,
digital portfolios can be just one more gimmick that a school adds to its
list of projects. For digital portfolios to truly take hold in a school,
a school has to address multiple systems.<A NAME="Systemic Issues"></A>
Below, we outline five areas of the school that need to be addressed, and
a set of questions that each school needs to take on.</P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="Vision"></A><B>Vision</B></LI>

<P><I>What should a student be able to know and do?</I></P>

<P>First and foremost, a school needs to determine what capabilities all
of its gradautes should possess. The schools in this project consulted
a variety of audiences, from those inside the building every day (students,
faculty, and administrators) to parents and community members to educational
stakeholders such as colleges, businesses, and state departments of education.
In the digital portfolios, the vision is typically translated into the
portfolio's main menu, so that each student knows what is expected of him
or her before she leaves that school.</P>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="Assessment"></A><B>Assessment</B></LI>

<P><I>How can students demonstrate the vision?<BR>
Why do we collect student work?<BR>
What audiences are most important to us?<BR>
How do we know what's good?</I></P>

<P>A portfolio should be more than a collection of documents. If we think
about how portfolios have been traditionally used in areas like photography,
a portfolio represents a set of work that shows both range and depth, and
is typically reconstituted for any given audience. That is, a student creating
a portfolio needs to think about the audience who will be reviewing it.
</P>

<P>For a portfolio to be effective, a school needs to describe the purpose
for creating the portfolio, the potential audiences who will review the
portfolio, and the criteria which describes what makes a piece of work
worth placing in the portfolio. We would argue further that the portfolio
needs to be connected tightly to the school's vision.</P>

<P>The schools involved with the Digital Portfolio study answered these
questions differently. For some schools, the primary purpose of collecting
student work was for students to take stock of their own work, and celebrate
their accomplishments. A portfolio in these places was &quot;successful&quot;&nbsp;if
it provided an interesting picture of the student and his or her work.
Another approach is to use the portfolio as an evaluation tool, to demonstrate
student achievements against some standards. One school in the project
uses portfolios as a means of demonstrating that a student has accomplished
the skills and learned the knowledge expected of a graduate. </P>

<P>As Digital Portfolios become more common place, we can expect that other
audiences, ranging from state departments of education to college admissions
and placement offices, will become recipients of these portfolios. Still,
we expect that the primary audience will remain the student and his or
her teachers.</P>

<LI><A NAME="Technology"></A><B>Technology</B></LI>

<P><I>What hardware, software, and networking will we need?<BR>
Who are the primary users of the equipment?<BR>
Who will support the system?</I></P>

<P>Putting together digital portfolios obviously requires access to hardware
and software; for the portfolios to be truly useful to an entire school
community, that hardware needs to be networked.</P>

<P>In the project, schools used different configurations, depending on
how the school operates. In one school where students and teachers spend
most of their day together as a team (consisting of about 80 students and
3 teachers), each team shared a set of six computers, at least one of which
had capabilities for capturing video and audio, a scanner, and a laser
printer. In other schools, a set of five to 15 machines were set aside
as &quot;digital portfolio&quot; stations, meaning that they had multimedia
capabilities, and were specifically reserved (for at least part of the
day) for students working on their portfolios. (The assumption is that
other machines in the school could be used for word processing or other
tasks that did not require specific multimedia software; a word processed
document, for example, could then be sent over the network to the digital
portfolio machines, or stored on a disk and walked down (using &quot;sneaker-net&quot;)
to the digital portfolio stations.)</P>

<P>The portfolios themselves were typically stored on hard disks, either
on individual machines, or on a network. As could be expected, audio and
video clips took up a great deal of disk space; without audio or video
clips, a collection of a student's year of work could be stored in about
10 megabytes. With audio and video, the number quickly balloons to 50 megabytes
or more. (One technology, introduced fairly late in the project, but proved
to be effective in transporting portfolios is the Zip drive from Iomega
technologies. A Zip disk typically contains 100 megabytes of space on a
readable and writable cartridge, and cost about US$15 each.)</P>

<P>In general, putting entries into the digital portfolio itself did not
require a great deal of time; after an hour or two of learning how to use
the digital portfolio &quot;shell,&quot; students could add an entry to
their portfolios in about five minutes. What takes time is putting work
into digital form in the first place -- word processing, scanning, or digitizing
audio or video. As the schools discovered, it was easier when students
did their original work on a computer (when appropriate); if students,
as a matter of habit, word process their papers, adding a document to a
portfolio is no big deal.</P>

<P>Access to equipment often determined who used the digital portfolios.
If teachers cannot easily get to a computer, they are not likely to look
at students' digital portfolios. One school's approach to this problem
was to put computers on as many teachers' desks as possible. Initially,
the school had about one computer for every two teachers; the school tried
to pair teachers with more computer experience with colleagues who were
less sure about the technology. The critical component, though, was (in
the words of Conrad Hilton) location, location, location. Teachers needed
to be able to go as short a distance as possible to get to the machines.
Similarly, if students did not have regular access to equipment, they were
not as likely to work on their digital portfolios. </P>

<P>Technical support is the often overlooked component of a school's technology
system. Ideally, a school's computing coordinator can be a champion for
digital portfolios, provide enough support and encouragement to teachers
and students to help them be excited and comfortable with using the technology.
At the same time, the coordinator needs to see how the digital portfolios
fit with the rest of the school, so that the project is not seen as &quot;Mr.
Techie's Project.&quot;&nbsp;It's not just about the &quot;wires and pliers&quot;&nbsp;of
using technology -- the technical support also has to have enough vision
to see how technology generally and digital portfolios in particular fits
with the school's other systems.</P>

<LI><A NAME="Logistics"></A><B>Logistics</B></LI>

<P><I>When will information be digitized?&nbsp;Who will do it?<BR>
Who will select the work?<BR>
Who will reflect on the work?</I></P>

<P>Putting portfolios together, digital or paper, requires teacher and
student time. One of the schools described the process as &quot;collect,
select, present, reflect.&quot; Students need to think about what they
entries they will collect, how to select those that best convey their abilities,
how to present those entries in a reasonably coherent fashion, and how
to reflect on what their portfolio means. Similarly, teachers need to be
engaged in the process at each step.</P>

<P>In the schools in our study, digital portfolios (unlike their paper
counterparts)&nbsp;are considered the responsibility of the students. The
expectation in every one of the schools is that students will be responsible
for digitizing the information. Now, in a couple of schools, a small group
of students did the digitizing for others, but in most cases, students
scanned and word processed their own work.</P>

<P>Similarly, students were expected to select the work for the portfolio.
The expectations of what work should be selected depended a great deal
on the purposes and audiences for the portfolio, and even among students
in the same school, the ways that students selected their work varied.
Teachers often helped to establish the criteria of what kind of work makes
sense for the portfolio, but ultimately students were given responsibility
for that decision.</P>

<P>We found that precious little time was given to reflecting on the portfolios.
Part of the reason is that, for most of the schools, this was the first
year of a technology-driven project -- simply creating the digital portfolios
is a major accomplishment. It is only now that there are examples in front
of them that the faculty and the school communities can determine what
makes a &quot;good&quot;&nbsp;portfolio. Still, schools need to allocate
time for reflecting on the work collected in the portfolio, be it through
a celebration (such as a special parents' night at one school where students
demonstrate what they have done) to a formal presentation (at one school,
students present their portfolios to a &quot;roundtable&quot;&nbsp;as part
of the requirements for advancement and graduation). Without some time
for reflection, the digital portfolio might be no different than a paper
portfolio filed away in a locked cabinet.</P>

<LI><A NAME="Culture"></A><B>Culture</B></LI>

<P><I>Is the school used to discussing student work?<BR>
Is the school open to tuning standards?&nbsp;With whom?</I></P>

<P>The school's culture is perhaps the most critical component in making
the Digital Portfolios a tool for school reform versus a technological
version of a set of file folders. The Technology, Assessment, and Logistics
systems can be represented as a set of structures, but unless the school
has developed relationships among students and teachers, those structures
can be very mechanical. </P>

<P>Discussions of student work are relatively rare in traditional schools.
What a student does in one class is rarely built upon in another class,
and then mostly through coordination of assignments among the teachers,
rather than through understanding a student's abilities and needs for intellectual
growth. </P>

<P>When a school community takes student work seriously, and allows teachers,
students, and others to reflect on what they have done, then the Digital
Portfolio has more meaning. One teacher knew that other schools in the
project were using portfolios as a requirement for graduation, and mentioned,
&quot;unless we do something like that, we are just making up reasons&quot;&nbsp;for
students to create digital portfolios. </P>

<P>This culture of reflecting on one's work not only applies to students,
but also to teachers and administrators. A few schools in the project presented
their vision statements to &quot;critical friends&quot; in an attempt to
&quot;tune&quot; their standards (much like members of an orchestra &quot;tune&quot;&nbsp;their
instruments with each other). Opening a school's vision up for scrutiny
can be threatening, but tuning standards allows a school to say with confidence
to its community that its work and its vision can stand up to scrutiny
from others.</P>

<P>Thus, the key elements of a school's culture that makes a digital portfolio
system work are the realtionships within the school, regular discussions
of student work, and an openness to discuss the school's work and its vision
with others outside the school.</P>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="What do DPs add"></A>What Do Digital Portfolios Add?</H3>

<P>Portfolio systems generally, and digital portfolio systems in particular,
require a great deal of energy, time, and resources from a school. Even
though it is very early in development, we have noted a few advantages
that digital portfolios bring to schools involved in reform. </P>

<P><I>Digital portfolios bring a school's vision and standards to life</I>.
In many traditional schools, students find the school's vision to be a
mystery. They know they need to complete certain courses, or do the work
assigned by a teacher, but it's very hard to put that work into a coherent
picture. Since the Digital Portfolio is organized around a school's vision,
it makes the vision very clear to students; each time the student opens
his or her portfolio, the work is sorted according to the elements of the
vision.</P>

<P>By making the school's vision open, it also makes it more dynamic. In
one school, a first attempt at organizing a portfolio around 19 goals quickly
made it clear that a number of those goals were not clearly distinguishable
for students or for teachers; the school engaged in a number of conversations
around what their vision for students, and changed its vision to a set
of five goals that the faculty can more clearly convey to students. At
another school, the vision was adapted from state guidelines; students
who were wondering where to insert their work in the portfolio asked teachers
what elements of the vision were demonstrated by a particular project.
Some teachers had not previously considered how their assignments fit into
the state guidelines, and being asked the question by students forced them
to think about how their own visions fit with the school's and the state's
expectations.</P>

<P>Some schools have started to use digital portfolios to explain the school's
vision to parents, school boards, or other visitors. Using multimedia,
schools can show how their vision is demonstrated by actual student work,
rather than abstract descriptions. Similarly, it allows schools to consider
what students are capable of doing, and by examining student work from
all levels of achievement, a school can consider if it needs to reset its
expectations.</P>

<P><I>Students own their portfolios</I>. Ask most faculties who knows the
most about technology in the school, and inevitably, they will answer,
&quot;the kids.&quot; In the project, students were given more responsibility
for maintaining their digital portfolios than their paper equivalents.
In talking with students, we found that they felt more ownership for their
digital portfolios than for paper portfolios. Students discussed the effort
they had put into the presentation of their work in multimedia, and the
technology skills they acquired in building the portfolios. Clearly, students
who invested time in building the portfolios took ownership for its appearance.</P>

<P>Many students in the project also noted that they wanted to create a
picture of their skills and abilities for people who were important to
them (ranging from peers to parents to prospective employers). Because
the portfolio was a reflection of their entire body of work, not just a
single course or subject area, students regularly mentioned that the digital
portfolio was presenting a more complete picture of who they are than any
other data that the school was presenting. A number of students mentioned
that one strategy for applying to college is to &quot;sell yourself&quot;&nbsp;and
describe what is unique about you; they said that the Digital Portfolio
allows them to show those attributes.</P>

<P><I>Communication is easier</I>. As Nicholas Negroponte points out in
<I>Being Digital </I>(Basic Books?, 1995), bits have great advantages over
atoms. Bits are easy to transport; atoms are difficult. In the case of
portfolios, the sheer volume of material and media makes Digital Portfolios
much easier to transport than paper portfolios. </P>

<P>Each of the schools was in the midst of networking its computers as
the project was winding down, and thus there has been little testing thus
far of how often teachers or other students would look at digital portfolios
outside of the room where they were developed. Still, the ability to look
at a student's complete portfolio, using multiple media, from any machine
within a building, was something that encouraged the schools to become
part of the Digital Portfolio project in the first place.</P>

<P>There is also the assumption that Digital Portfolios will make it easier
to transmit information from the school to other audiences. That is, students
could show their portfolios to their parents at home, or bring the portfolios
with them when they changed schools. With the technology used in the project,
this is technically more difficult, simply because the Digital Portfolio
software was written specifically to run on Windows-based machines. However,
with the advent of tools for the World Wide Web, and various other technologies
to transport multimedia data across wires and to different platforms, communication
of portfolios should be much easier in the months and years to come.</P>

<P>The specific digital portfolio software used in this project is not
commercially available. However, schools interested in working with digital
portfolios can choose from a number of software products. These fall into
two broad categories: software specifically designed for work with portfolios,
and general hypermedia software tools.</P>

<P>(Please note that this listing of software by no means constitutes an
endorsement of these products.)</P>

<H4>Software specifically for portfolios</H4>

<P>These tools are specifically designed for collecting information about
student work. The particular features vary, and thus you should carefully
consider what you want from your portfolio system, and how each tool might
help.</P>

<H4>Hypermedia software</H4>

<P>A number of schools are using hypermedia tools to build portfolios from
scratch. In a typical project, students are given some guidelines (include
five pieces of work, including the assignment and an assessment; on a front
page, include buttons to link for work in writing or that show problem
solving), and some instruction on how to use the particular software tool.
These tools allow for greater flexibility than those listed in the previous
section, but they require at least a little more time to learn and use.
</P>

<P>In addition to the hypermedia software products listed below, some schools
are considering how to create digital portfolios using web-based tools.
The assumption is that student work will be available on a school's local
intranet, rather than to the entire Internet. You may want to consider
HTML and web page editors and organizers for your development.</P>

The Digital School Portfolio is also intended to communicate the school's goals, practices and results, including samples of student work and images of teaching and learning, to a wider audience, including parents, community members, college admissions officers, and others.<p>Monroe Middle School in Rochester, New York, has been the site for development of the first Digital School Portfolio prototype.  The prototype has been developed by the Annenberg Institute for School Reform working closely with staff at Monroe, as well as with the School Quality Review team of the New York State Education Department, David Green of the Institute for Education and Social Policy at New York University, and staff of the Center for Children and Technology in New York City.  IBM has provided support for this project.<p>Over the course of the 1995-96 school year, the Monroe prototype was expanded and field-tested as several other prototypes were developed.  It is intended that the Digital School Portfolio become an effective accountability resource in schools, districts and states across the country.

<html><head><title>AISR: Projects: Math/Science Fellows</title></head><body bgcolor=#ffffff><hr><center><h1>Math/Science Fellows Project</h1></center><hr><p>In 1993, Brown University received a four-year grant from the Teacher Enhancement division of National Science Foundation for a project entitled "Math/Science Fellows:  Restructuring Mathematics and Science in Essential Schools".  The secondary mathematics and science teachers selected to participate in this program attend a one-week winter institute and a four-week summer institute in each of two consecutive years.  The first-year institutes provide the Math/Science Fellows with experiences and resources designed to expand their knowledge of science and math and to enhance their teaching practice, particularly through the use of inquiry-based learning and integrated curriculum.  The academic year program includes, in addition to teaching in their own schools, participation in conferences and regional symposia, an electronic bulletin board network, recripocal school-site visits, and on-going support from the Annenberg Institute for School Reform staff.  During the second year of training, the Fellows continue to develop their skills with respect to curriculum design and implementation, as they teach math/science courses within Brown University's summer high school.  In addition, the second year consists of an opportunity for these teachers to develop skills required to work collaboratively with colleagues in their own schools and in neighboring schools.  This experience prepares the Fellows to share ideas, knowledge, and skills with other teachers.  The second academic year program is similar to that of the first year.  Throughout the training, the Fellows are able to experiment, in a collaborative and non-competitive environment, with changes in their own knowledge and practice.<P>In the course of this work we learned some important lessons.  Professional development must be ongoing and in-depth with teachers intimately involved in both experiencing and designing the process.  The pace is critical; the process needs to be fast enough to see growth and yet slow enough to permit reflection.  Teachers need time to experience change themselves;  they need time to plan, to experiment, to redesign and to refine their practices, and then to implement the changes.  To build new professional knowledge and expertise, teachers need to engage in their own inquiry-based learning through direct observation and manipulation.  They need ample opportunities to practice new activities, hands-on laboratory investigations and field activities, all in low-risk environments.  <P>Teachers who are trying to implement changes in their schools and classrooms need the support of both the teaching and local community.  Within each school setting, it is essential to have a critical mass of practitioners with similar ideas who can provide formal/informal opportunities for peer coaching and feedback.  Schools need to establish learning communities which value and support reflective practice, creativity and collegiality.  In many schools, this scheme for providing ongoing learning experiences for teachers represents a significant change in professional development.

<html><head><title>AISR: Projects: NSRF</title></head><body bgcolor=#ffffff><hr><center><h1>The National School Reform Faculty Program</h1><h3>Critical Friends as a Route to Improved Student Learning</h3></center><hr><p>Teachers today face complex challenges.  They are expected to use unfamiliar techniques to teach new kinds of knowledge and thinking skills to students who are very different from those twenty years ago.  There is a lot of evidence that the best way to approach these challenges is to help school people work together productively on changing practice to improve student learning.  That is the basis of the National School Reform Faculty Program.<p>The National School Reform Faculty Program (NSRF)<ul><li>is rooted in local goats and integrated into the life of particular schools<li>provides a structure for school people to work together as "critical friends" who look closely at one another's practice and help improve it.<li>trains a coach, chosen by the participants, to help participants learn to work together most effectively<li>offers additional learning opportunities for coaches and group members<li>begins with work on individual practice, then builds toward whole school improvement<li>works with national school reform networks</ul>At the heart of the program is the Critical Friends Group (CFG).  CFGs consist of teachers and administrators who commit themselves to two years of working together towards better student learning.  They set up at least one two-hour meeting each month, at which they establish and publicly state student learning goals, help each other think about more productive teaching practices, look closely at curriculum and student work, and identify school culture issues that affect student achievement.  Group members also observe one another at work at least monthly and offer feedback to each other in challenging, but non-threatening ways.<p>They are helped in that process by a coach, selected from within the staff or from the ranks of trusted outsiders.  Coaches begin to learn the skills and information they need to guide this work at a six-day Summer Seminar.  At these Seminars, experienced coaches and professional development specialists work with new coaches, creating an experience where participants learn and practice new techniques while building a reflective, mutually supportive culture that is itself an example of the kind professional learning community CFGs can become.  Coaches and CFGs may later participate in a variety of advanced learning opportunities designed around issues that emerge from their work.<p>CFG members--including coaches--maintain portfolios that track the progress of their work during the two-year program.  At the end of two years (or longer, depending on individuals' choices) participants present their portfolios to a panel of peers.  'Those whose portfolios confirm their success in reaching their CFG's stated goals become National School Reform Faculty members, and will then be able to serve as coaches and consultants in their own schools and elsewhere.

<html><head><title>AISR: Projects: NSRF Evaluation</title></head><body bgcolor=#ffffff><hr><center><h1>The National School Reform Faculty Evaluation</h1></center><hr><p><h3>Study Design</h3>The primary purpose of the National School Reform Faculty Evaluation is to understand the relationship between Critical Friends Groups, teacher collegiality, changed teacher practice, and improved student achievement.  By studying selected samples of CFGs from the first three cohorts for three years each, the evaluation team will address the following overarching research questions:<UL><LI> Does the purposeful establishment of a CFG in a school create collegialityamong CFG members?<LI>Does the establishment of a CFG in a school result in improved teacherpractice among CFG members?<LI>Does evidence exist for improvement in student achievement in the classesof CFG members over a period of three years?<LI>Does evidence exist for changes over time in collegiality, teacher practice,and student achievement among CFG teachers?</UL>The evaluation will study three sample populations-each from a different cohort of CFGs-for three years each.  Each sample will address different sets of research questions in different years.  Studying three cohorts will enable researchers to examine NSRF at different levels of maturity; studying each cohort for three years will provide evidence for what happens after program intervention (two years long) ends.The work of NSRF-and the evaluation-derives largely from research conducted by Milbrey McLaughlin and Joan Talbert of Stanford University.  In a study of sixteen schools in Michigan and California, McLaughlin and Talbert discovered that test scores increased among students whose teachers met in naturally-occurring collegial groups.  This research identified a "black box," into which went collegial teacher relationships and out of which emerged enhanced student performance.  The NSRF evaluation attempts to expand current understandings of collegiality by examining deliberately-structured groups.  More importantly, this evaluation attempts to understand what goes on in McLaughlin and Talbert's "black box" by establishing concrete relationships between CFGS, teacher collegiality, and student achievement.The research questions listed above will serve as the basis for all three evaluation cohorts.  Sub-sets of questions will explore how the following variables influence collegiality, teachers' practice, and student achievement:<UL><LI> multiple CFGs in one school<LI> administrator involvement in CFG<LI> history of involvement with reform efforts<LI> coach's prior facilitation experience<LI>school conditions such as size, demographics, and locale</UL><h3>Data Collection</h3>Each phase of the evaluation will rely equally on qualitative and quantitative data.  Qualitative measures will include interviews with teachers, principals, and students; classroom observations of those teachers interviewed; and examination of written documents-including CFG agendas and participants' journals.  Both CFG and non-CFG teachers will be interviewed in order to determine what relative changes occur in CFG teachers' practice over a three-year period.A survey-based on a collegiality survey developed for McLaughlin's study and a climate survey used in Fred Newmann's study of 24 restructuring schools-will serve as the primary source of quantitative data.<h3>First-Year Insights</h3>Since the evaluation team is in the process of analyzing first-year data, it is difficult at this point to make generalizations or conclusions about the overall effects of the program.  However, several themes have emerged from the first year that will help us reformulate research questions and protocols for year two.  They include:<UL><LI> A relationship seems to exist between peer coaching and breaking downteacher isolation.<LI> In schools where administrators participate in a CFG, the ideas discussed inCFGs appear to be taking hold more quickly in the entire school community.<LI> CFGs that have explicitly articulated student learning goals have moreeasily entered conversations about student work.</UL>The first year has also provided rich examples of what CFGs look like indifferent school settings.<p><hr><p><b>See also: <a href="nsrf.htm">The National School Reform Faculty Program page</a>

<html><head><title>AISR: Projects: Research</title></head><body bgcolor=#ffffff><hr><center><h1>The Research Center</h1></center><hr><p>Research is pervasive at the Annenberg Institute for School Reform, playing a role in nearly all its activities.  The Institute's Research Center exists to foster coherence and high quality in these diverse research efforts, and to offer support in design and dissemination.  Currently, for example, it is assisting with the design and conduct of both the cross-site evaluation of the Annenberg Challenge, and the evaluation of the Institute's National School Reform Faculty.<p>In addition, the Institute's Research Center undertakes special research projects related to the Institute's highest priorities.  The current example is the Rethinking Accountability Project.  This aims to create new conceptions, practices, and tools in an area that is now central to school reform efforts in the United States.  It involves fieldwork in three states with major and contrasting accountability initiatives underway (Illinois, New York, and Rhode Island); an exploration of the accountability initiatives also underway in several major reform networks; a reconnaissance of tools useful in building capacity for accountability throughout the interlocking systems of American schooling and particularly within schools themselves; and an effort to create a new and comprehensive theory of what accountability means and of how it might best be achieved.  The project involves the participation of all the other Institute centers -- in professional development, school outreach, policy, public engagement, and the Challenge -- and is co-led by Joseph McDonald, Susan Lusi, and Margaret MacMullen.<p>Finally, the Research Center is active in disseminating new ideas in school reform.  It does this through its sponsorship and co-sponsorship of working conferences on key topics of school reform, and through its publications efforts.  It manages two ongoing publications series, and collaborates in the production of a third.  The first is a refereed monograph series that publishes theoretical and empirical work on important matters of school reform.  The series, launched in November 1996, features work by Institute researchers and also by outside researchers and practitioners, and is available from the Institute's publications office.  The second series, published in conjunction with Jossey-Bass Publishers, features short books on key problems of school reform in the United States.  The first books in this series will be available in late 1997 in bookstores and directly from Jossey-Bass.  Finally, the Research Center collaborates in the development of the longest running and most significant book series in the field, the series on school reform at Teachers College Press.

<html><head><title>CES: Principles: General Description of the Common Principles</title></head> <body bgcolor=#ffffff><hr><h1><center>A General Description of the Common Principles</center></h1><p><hr><p>What Essential schools hold in common is a simple set ofprinciples that give focus to their effort.  The Coalition offers no specific model to "plug in"; we reject the practice of top-down, standardizedsolutions to school problems on the simple ground that theydemonstrably do not work. Schools are fragile places andgain their stability from often subtle accommodation to theneeds, character, strengths and weaknesses of thecommunities in which they reside. The heart of fineeducation is the constructive confrontation of able teachersand willing pupils - a joining that cannot be mass-produced.It emerges from deft and sensible adaptation, school byschool, even classroom by classroom, and from a commitmentto learning that best flourishes when students and teachersfeel a strong sense of ownership of their particular school.<p>   The principles that provide the framework for ourcollective endeavor reveal an ideology about schooling andlearning that places "personalization" high on the list ofimperatives. A personalized education is one where studentsare known by the adult professionals in school. In mostschools, making this personalization a reality will requirethe restructuring of many institutional features. Theteacher-to-pupil ratio, for example, must be lower than wetypically find (one teacher to no more that eighty studentsis our recommendation). With a more manageable number ofstudents, teachers may be expected to orchestrate classactivities more imaginatively - finding various ways to callupon student initiative and ways to place students moreroutinely in the role of the inquiring scholar and hardworker.<p>   Such a vision, of course, presupposes certain aims ofeducation. We maintain that the focus of a secondary schoolprogram should be on helping students to use their mindswell and that a high school graduate should have the abilityto show his or her knowledge and skill - to "exhibit"mastery - in a variety of areas deemed important by localand external authorities. This suggests that the high schooldiploma should signify genuine competence, specifically inthe areas of reading, writing and fundamental mathematics.Essential schools should also be places where decencyprevails, where social and professional relationships aretypified by tolerance, generosity and fairness. This is thephilosophical bedrock of the Coalition as spelled out in thenine Common Principles.<p>Click <a href="textncp.htm">here</a> to view the Nine Common Prinicples.<p><hr><p><a href = "principl.htm">Return to the Principles page.</a><p></body></html>

The complete New York Assessment Collection contains case studies on a wide range of locally developed student assessments, including exhibitions, portfolios, design projects, simulations and other performance tasks from schools across the state.<P>The New York Assessment Collection has three main purposes:<P><OL></a><li>  To support local development of assessments</a><li> To provide examples of good performance assessment across the curriculum and levels of schooling</a><li>  To promote communication among schools about good assessment practice.<P></OL>The New York Assessment Collection has been developed by the <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://home.aisr.brown.edu/aisr/">Annenberg Institute for School Reform</A>, Brown University.  Support for this project has been provided by the New York State Education Department and IBM.  The case studies that make up the collection represent examples of locally developed student assessments.  These assessments are intended to provide teachers and other educators with a better understanding of the varieties of assessment practice.  They are not intended to serve as assessments developed or endorsed by the New York State Education Department or the New York State Board of Regents, nor to substitute for such assessments.<P>On this site, you'll find a complete list of all the assessments included in the New York Assessment Collection, as well a menu of five sample assessments.  You'll also find information on how to order the complete New York Assessment Collection on CD-ROM, disks (for Macintosh or Windows) or print.  Finally, we invite you to give us your feedback about the Assessment Collection and/or join in a 'threaded discussion' about assessment issues.<P><a name="dimensions"><hr><p><h3>Dimensions of Assessment</h3>To help teachers learn about these assessments, each of the 33 assessments in the Assessment Collection is described in six dimensions.  It's our belief that these six dimensions not only help describe these complex assessments, but also provide teachers a useful framework of questions for discussing and developing assessments for their own students and within their own school context. <P> <H3>The six dimensions are:</H3><P><B><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="CPARK/SCH1.htm">Vision</A>:*</B>  What are the goals for student performance?<BR><B><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="CPARK/prompt.htm">Prompt</A>:*</B>  What is it that students know they'll need to do?<BR><B><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="CPARK/perform.htm">Performance</A>:*</B>  What does student work and performance look like?<BR><B><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="CPARK/evaluate.htm">Evaluation</A>:*</B>  What are the criteria for judging student performance?<BR><B><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="CPARK/context.htm">Context</A>:*</B>  How do teachers support student performance?<BR><B><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="CPARK/reflect.htm">Reflection</A>:*</B>  What kind of feedback is collected about the assessment?<BR><BR><b>* View a sample of each dimension, by clicking on these links.<P></b>The <B>Performance</B> dimension is central to each case study and always includes samples of actual student work.  The multimedia technology allows the user to view graphic and video images from the assessments, as well as text descriptions. In one case, for example, it is possible to view the blueprints of a student-designed machine, as well as read the written description of the design the students have prepared.  Users of the CD-ROM version will be able to look at short video clips of some student presentations, as well as students and teachers in the process of preparing for the assessment.<P>To describe each of the assessments in the Collection, the project staff worked closely with a teacher-consultant.  The teacher-consultants are the real experts on their own assessment systems, and have agreed to respond to questions and comments from users of the Assessment Collection.  A school address and e-mail address (when available) is included at the end of each assessment case study.<P><B>Please remember:</B>  None of the assessments included here is considered to be a perfect model.  Rather the New York Assessment Collection presents a selection of works in process as a resource for teachers engaged in developing assessments for their own students.  These will change from year to year as the teachers reflect on the students' performance and revise the assessments to be more effective.<P><a name="getting"><HR><p><h3>Getting Around The Assessment Collection World Wide Web Sampler</h3>We recommend that you first link to the <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="toc.htm">Table of Contents</A> for this Web  Site.  Here, you can view the layout of the New York Assessment Collection, as well as the options connected to it.  Once you've accessed the List of Participating Schools, you'll be able to browse through any of the five sample assessments underlined to show they are active links.  When you click on an underlined assessment title, you'll be taken automatically to the Vision Dimension for information about its goals and a summary of the entire assessment.  At any time--and in any order--you may click the other Dimensions (Prompt, Evaluation, etc.)<P>At the beginning of each Dimensions entry, you have the option of viewing  another Dimension, or accessing the Table of Contents and list of Participating Schools by simply clicking the underlined text by the same name. <P><a name="suggestions"><hr><h3>Suggestions for How to Use the New York Assessment Collection</h3><UL></a><li>Browse a variety of assessment case studies or explore several in depth to expand thinking about authentic assessments;</a><li>Use as an idea bank in developing your own assessments;</a><li>Choose one or more case studies as a centerpiece for staff discussion of authentic assessment;</a><li>Use selected assessments from the Collection to discuss goals and principles of authentic assessment with students, parents and other stakeholders;</a><li>Apply the dimensions (vision, prompt, etc.) to your own assessment practice:  How could you document assessment practice in your own classroom or school?</a><li>Make connections with other teachers and schools involved in authentic assessment.</UL><P><a name="future"><HR><p><h3>Future Directions and Feedback</h3>While the Assessment Collection is intended to be a resource for teachers right now, it is part of a larger study to discover how technology can support schools and teachers in shifting to more authentic teaching and assessment.  This year we have released the Assessment Collection on disk (version 1.0) and on CD-ROM with video clips (version 1.1), as well as this World Wide Web Sampler Page.<P>
