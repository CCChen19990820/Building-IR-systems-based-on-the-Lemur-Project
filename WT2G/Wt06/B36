The Virtual Clearinghouse on Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs is a collaborative effort of a 
number of organizations having an interest in disseminating high quality 
information about the nature, extent and consequences of alcohol, tobacco and other drug use.  This encompasses prevention, treatment, research, enforcement, and development of policy.  The Virtual Clearinghouse is intended to have worldwide representation and to present credible, balanced and quality information on issues related to the use and/or abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs.<P>
This is a six-month pilot project.  We welcome any <A HREF="/atod/atodform.htm">feedback</A> to help us improve our pages and evaluate this new service.<P>

<IMG SRC="/atod/tealbar.gif" WIDTH=569 HEIGHT=6><P><P>
The Virtual Clearinghouse on Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs is created and maintained by a number of organizations working in partnership.  Partners in the Virtual Clearinghouse must meet the following criteria, which have been established to ensure that the highest quality information possible is available through the Internet.
<H3>Criteria for Inclusion</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Must be an organization or agency, not just an individual.
<LI>Must have a presence on the Internet (not just e-mail), and is not merely advertising a product or 
service.
<LI>Must be providing unique, value-added information with respect to alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, 
some of which emanates from that organization.  This is the information that will be contributed to the 
full text database.
<LI>[Must be involved with policy, research and/or programming, and have an established library or 
resource centre providing information support to prevention/intervention specialists and/or the general 
public.  <I>This criterion is under discussion.</I>]
<LI>Should not be solely advocating or lobbying on a position, viewpoint or specific issue, but providing 
comprehensive and credible information (subjected to internal or external review and marked accordingly).
<LI>For organizations that do not qualify for, or are not interested in, partnership:
<UL>
<LI>A set of links to other ATOD resources on the Internet will be maintained.
<LI>Other organizations that wish to contribute to the information base, may do so through arrangements 
with partner organizations.
</UL>
</UL>
<H3>Process</H3>
Organizations wanting to become partners in the Virtual Clearinghouse would be assessed according to 
the established criteria.  Eventually, partner organizations would work with an advisory group, drawn from professionals in the field, to make 
membership decisions.  It is important to establish an initial membership that is international and 
representative of different sectors in the field.  Applications for partnership could be submitted 
electronically, for circulation to the planning committee/advisory group.<P>
<P>
Organizations wishing to become partners in the Clearinghouse should provide information to the Committee through this <A HREF="/atod/applic.htm">Application Form.</A>

The following report reviews cost studies which estimate the economic costs associated with 
problems related to the use of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs.  The review is comprehensive 
regarding the international academic literature and North American government documents.  
Some studies sponsored by the Australian, British and Swiss governments and the Commission 
of the European Communities have also been included.<P>
The review shows that no comprehensive cost of substance abuse study has ever been carried 
out in Canada.  Canadian studies focusing on individual substances do exist, but they are 
generally less than adequate for reasons of:  a) limited geographical scope;  b) outdated medical 
understanding;  c) methodological weakness.<P>

</U></B><H3><A NAME = major></A>Major 
Methodological Approaches</H3>
After reviewing the literature listed in Table 1, three major distinct methodologies for estimating 
the economic cost of substance abuse were identified.  These methodologies were all current 
and thorough and are exemplified by the publications of Rice et al. (1990), Manning et al. 
(1991), and Collins &amp  Lapsley (1991).  The funding for these major undertakings were 
respectively, the United States Public Health Service (US-PHS), the Rand Corporation in the 
U.S. and the Commonwealth of Australia.  Each of the methodologies has advantages and 
disadvantages regarding data availability, ease of use and intended application.  These 
considerations are discussed both in the present section and in later sections of the report.<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = USPHS></A>US-PHS Cost-of-illness 
Approach</H4>
The US-PHS approach dates back to at least the 1966 cost-of-illness (COI) study by Dorothy 
Rice (Rice 1966).  Several studies followed, leading to a systemization of COI methods by a 
1979 task force (Hodgson &amp  Meiners 1979).  The fundamental approach in these 
prevalence-based studies was to determine all 'forgone alternatives' or 'opportunity costs' to the 
economy which resulted from illness or death in the current year caused by past and present 
substance abuse.  Costs included all direct costs (those in which payment was made and 
resources used) and all indirect costs (those in which resources were lost through impaired 
productivity or premature mortality).  <P>
The US-PHS approach has been widely accepted, as evidenced by an abundance of U.S. state 
smoking studies (Adams 1994; Chudy et al. 1992; Cummings et al. 1992; Davis et al. 1990; 
Gorsky et al. 1990; Smith et al. 1990; Williams &amp  Franklin 1990; Wassilak et al. 1989), a 
Japanese alcohol study (Nakamura 1993) and a City of Toronto smoking study (Kendall 
1992).  The dissemination of this approach has presumably been facilitated by its adaptation to 
user-friendly LOTUS-based software format (Shultz et al. 1991a; 1991b).  Of note too, is a 
Swiss-based study of illicit drug costs (Institut suisse de prohylaxie de l'alcoolisme 1990) which, 
while introducing novel methods for estimating individual cost components, also used a COI 
framework similar to that of the US-PHS type studies.<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = external></A>External Cost Approach</H4>
In contrast to the US-PHS methodology in which all private costs (paid by the substance user) 
and all external costs (paid by others) were included, the study of Manning et al. (1989; 1991) 
considered only the latter and calculated the external costs per substance user and per unit of 
substance.  Furthermore, the study was incidence-based and a lifetime model of use was 
employed.  Thus, the cost-benefit totals calculated by Manning et al. represented the current 
value of present and future substance use.<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = demographic></A>Demographic 
Approach</H4>
The study of Collins &amp  Lapsley (1991) offered a third approach, now known as the 
demographic approach, because it involved the construction of a hypothetical present-day 
abuse-free population.  [A Canadian study by Forbes &amp  Thompson (1983) provided some 
precedence for this approach].  In this prevalence-based method, the <U>net</U> costs for 
the present year of past and present substance abuse were determined, which was a framework 
consistent with microeconomic reform in Australia.  This meant that, unlike the above studies, no 
discounted future costs, and the uncertainty inherent in such costs, were applied to the present 
year.  The study also differed from others in its attempt to thoroughly list and even estimate, in 
some cases, the <U>intangible</U> costs of abuse (eg. pain and suffering).<P>
<P><B><U>
</U></B><H3><A NAME = 
method></A>Methodological Issues</H3>
The following identifies some of the methodological issues which emerged in the review of the 
literature.  An understanding of these issues would provide some of the background which 
would be useful, if not necessary for a) making a well-grounded comparison among published 
studies and b) designing a new cost study.<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = costillness></A>Cost-of-illness vs. Cost-benefit 
and Cost-effectiveness analyses</H4>
The US-PHS cost-of-illness (COI) studies have been criticized for a lack of policy relevance 
because they don't consider policy options, as would cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analyses 
(DiNardo 1992; Sindelar 1991).  H.J. Harwood, who has been involved in the COI studies, 
concurs with the value of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness studies, but nevertheless considers 
a COI study to be a prerequisite for the other studies in that it a) provides a comprehensive 
summary of the wide variety of costs involved and b) provides political justification for 
conducting other types of studies (Harwood 1991).<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = prevalence></A>Prevalence-based vs. Incidence-
based Analyses </H4>
Prevalence-based studies measure the costs in a given year associated with the prevalence of 
substance-related morbidity and mortality attributable to past and present substance use. Such 
studies are more common, according to a report of the U.S. Surgeon General (USDHHS 
1992), because the methodology is relatively simple, the data is readily available, and results are 
consistent.  Given the aforementioned widespread use of US-PHS methodology, availability of 
results for comparison would likely be an additional reason for using such methods.<P>
Incidence-based estimates, on the other hand, calculate the present day value of the lifetime 
costs associated with the current population cohort.  Thus, whereas prevalence-based estimates 
reflect historical use of a substance, incidence-based estimates reflect current and future use.  
As such, they can be more useful to policymakers because they can more readily evaluate the 
effect of current changes in substance use patterns (USDHHS 1992).  However, there are also 
significant drawbacks to this approach, including its more sophisticated data requirements and 
its uncertainty in predicting future economic, technological and social trends, which all influence 
health care and other costs (USDHHS 1992).<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = externality></A>Externality of Costs</H4>
The US-PHS studies have also been criticized for a lack of policy relevance because there has 
been no distinction or separate accounting for those costs which are internal (costs borne by the 
abuser) and those which are external (costs borne by others) (Ellemann-Jensen 1991; Heien 
&amp  Pittman 1989; Manning 1991).  According to Manning (1991), such calculations are 
especially relevant to tax policy on demerit goods, for an economically efficient excise tax would 
be one in which the external costs of that good would be recovered through taxation.<P>
Three studies, one American (Manning et al. 1991), one British (Fazey &amp  Stevenson 
1990) and one Canadian (Raynauld &amp  Vidal 1992), calculated only the external costs of 
substance use.  The first among these used incidence-based methods and was the most 
thorough of the three.  Two other Canadian works seem to be primarily estimates of external 
costs, although this objective was not explicitly stated (Adrian et al. 1989; CLEU 1992).<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = discount></A>Discount Rate</H4>
Discounting is used when future costs are assigned to the current year.  This has a limited, but 
significant effect on standard COI studies like the US-PHS studies, because the indirect costs of 
premature mortality (i.e. future earnings) involve discounting.  For example, data included in 
Rice et al. (1990) showed that the total costs of alcohol abuse would have been about 10% 
higher or lower if the discount rate had been 4% or 10% respectively, instead of 6%.  Similarly, 
data in Rice et al. (1986) showed that the total costs of tobacco abuse would have been 
estimated to be 5% higher if a discount rate of 4% had been chosen instead of 6%.  The 
tobacco costs were less sensitive to discount rate because the excess mortality associated with 
tobacco use occurs farther in the future than that associated with alcohol use.  Costs associated 
with drug use were even less sensitive to the choice of discount rate (Rice et al. 1990) because 
mortality costs were a smaller percentage of the total costs, which were dominated by crime-
associated costs.  <P>
Collins &amp  Lapsley (1991) criticized several studies for not including a range of final 
estimates when discount rates were involved in the calculation.  Even more negligent in this 
regard were several recent studies in which the discount rate was not even stated, indicating 
perhaps an ignorance of the issue (Chudy et al. 1990;  Davis et al. 1990; Gorsky et al. 1988; 
1990).  <P>
Incidence-based studies can be even more sensitive to discounting because future costs are so 
heavily involved in the calculations.  Manning et al. (1989) showed that the net external cost of 
smoking was a negative value if the discount rate was set at 0% and a positive value if it was set 
at 5%.  In contrast, the costs associated with drinking were much less sensitive to choice of 
discount rate because there is less of a delay between consumption and its major consequences 
in the case of drinking (eg. traffic accidents) than there is in the case of smoking (eg. lung 
cancer).<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = social></A>Social and Private Costs</H4>
The terms 'private cost' and 'social cost' are not universally understood in the literature.  There 
seems to be two schools of thought, as detailed below.  <P>
As described by Markandya &amp  Pearce (1989) and later adopted by Collins &amp  
Lapsley (1991):<P>
"To the extent that the costs are knowingly and freely borne by the consumer or 
producer himself, they are referred to as private costs but to the extent that they 
are not so borne but fall on the rest of society, they are referred to as social 
costs.  Hence the total cost of any activity is the sum of the private and social 
costs." (Markandya &amp  Pearce 1989: 1139)<P>
Thus, the assignment of costs would depend on one's view of the nature of consumption of 
tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs.  [For example, does a model of 'rational addiction' apply, 
where all costs were knowingly and freely born?]  <P>
On the other hand, Ellemann-Jensen (1991), despite basing his article on Markandya &amp  
Pearce's (1989), defines the gross social costs of a good as "the total private costs 
(acknowledged as well as unacknowledged) plus the costs to others".  This definition is in line 
with that of French et al. (1991) from the US Public Health Service who wrote, "the social cost 
of the activity is simply the sum of the private and external cost after adjusting for transfers 
within society", and "the private cost of an activity is that incurred by the individual(s) engaging in 
the activity."  Finally, Manning et al. (1991) are also in accordance by stating that "the total 
social costs of smoking are the sum of internal and external costs".<P>
As indicated above, one must be certain of an author's use of the terms 'private cost' and 'social 
cost' when reviewing the literature.<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = indirect></A>Indirect Costs of Mortality</H4>
In not all cases have researchers included the value of production forgone through premature 
mortality.  For those considering only external costs, either explicitly (Manning et al. 1991; 
Fazey &amp  Stevenson 1990; Raynauld &amp  Vidal 1992) or implicitly (Adrian et al. 1989; 
CLEU 1990), this cost is excluded because it is considered an internal one.  In contrast, the 
US-PHS framework included this cost because it is considered a foregone opportunity.  <P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = effect></A>Effect of Alcohol on 
Productivity</H4>
The US-PHS studies attempt to capture all the various means by which alcohol can affect 
income, as identified by Cruze et al. (1981):  lower occupational achievement;  reduced labour 
force participation;  increased unemployment;  increased part-time work;  absenteeism and 
tardiness;  reduced productivity on the job.  Cost studies from other countries tend to estimate 
only some of these factors.  <P>
Much controversy has surrounded the estimation of this component in US-PHS studies.  The 
issue is discussed briefly below and Rice et al. (1990) discuss in detail their attempts to address 
earlier criticisms.<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = risk></A>Risk Ratios and Attributable 
Fractions</H4>
Estimates of tobacco-related risk ratios and corresponding attributable fractions have changed 
as the medical literature has advanced.  With the 1989 Surgeon General report (USDHHS 
1989), many of the earlier risk ratios associated with tobacco use were increased markedly 
from those given in earlier Surgeon General reports.  The 1989 values are the ones currently 
employed in the most recent US-PHS studies, including those which used SAMMEC II 
software.<P>
Alcohol-related attributable fractions used by the US-PHS, and incorporated to a great extent 
in the ARDI software (Shultz et al. 1991a), have been criticized with respect to their accuracy 
and validity (Heien &amp  Pittman 1989).  This has been addressed in part by Rice et al. 
(1990), as described below.<P>
Collins &amp  Lapsley (1991; 1994) based their mortality estimates on a very detailed review 
of the medical literature by Holman &amp  Armstrong (1990).  This source of attributable 
fractions might even be preferable to the American sources.  Of note is that their risk ratios for 
tobacco-related diseases tend to be lower than the American (USDHHS 1989).  Furthermore, 
they have determined attributable fractions for some drug-related illnesses (eg. viral hepatitis, 
low birthweight);  such fractions did not appear in Rice et al. (1990).<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = cost></A>Cost of Substance</H4>
Collins &amp  Lapsley were somewhat unorthodox in their inclusion of the cost of abused 
substance, although justification can be found in the theoretical works by Markandya &amp  
Pearce (1989) and Ellemann-Jensen (1991).  Its inclusion has been based on the extent to 
which the substance is abused (Collins &amp  Lapsley 1991) or the extent to which 
consumption is addictive (Collins &amp  Lapsley 1994).  Thus, 89% (Collins &amp  Lapsley 
1994) or 100% (Collins &amp  Lapsley 1991) of the cost of tobacco, 30% of the cost of 
alcohol (Collins &amp  Lapsley 1991), and 100% of the cost of illicit drugs (Collins &amp  
Lapsley 1991) has been included in total costs.  The rationale has been that with addictive 
consumption, the consumer does not receive a benefit equal to the cost of the product and so 
that cost should be included within the total cost (Collins &amp  Lapsley 1994).<P>
If one were to exclude the cost of substance from the totals calculated by Collins &amp  
Lapsley, large effects would be seen.  For example, removing this substance cost from the totals 
shown in Table 2 would markedly decrease the values for tobacco (32%), alcohol (36%) and 
illicit drugs (41%).  <P>
<A NAME=Table2></A><A HREF="/litrev2.htm">Table 2: Comparison of total cost of substance abuse estimates for various countries</A><P>
<H4><A NAME = value></A>Value of Housework</H4>
Whereas earlier studies (eg. Collishaw &amp  Myers 1984) did not impute a value for 
housework lost through the premature mortality of homemakers, it became quite customary to 
do so soon afterwards (eg. Rice et al. 1985).  There is not an international consensus on this 
point however.  Collins &amp  Lapsley (1991) acknowledged the unpaid work presumed to be 
contributed by all adult citizens out of the work force, but did not account for this loss in their 
estimates of the value of production lost through premature mortality.  The Swiss study also did 
not account for this (Institut suisse de prophylaxie de l'alcoolisme 1990).<P>
McDonnel &amp  Maynard (1985) did not account for the value of housework in their 
mortality estimates, as these were based on an earlier study, but they did account for a value for 
housework lost through morbidity.  In this latter case, they were unique among all studies 
discussed here.<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = passive></A>Passive Smoking</H4>
Most published cost studies do not include the effect of passive smoking, though this could 
change in the near future.  The 1989 Surgeon General report stated that there was finally 
sufficient evidence to causally link tobacco-related disease to passive smoking (USDHHS 
1989).  Chudy et al. (1992) and Collins &amp  Lapsley (1994) were able to estimate the 
number of deaths due to passive smoking as 10% of those due to direct smoking, using recent 
studies as a basis (Environmental Protection Agency 1990; Glantz &amp  Parmley 1992; 
Steenland 1992).<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = controlling></A>Controlling for Other Risk 
Behaviours</H4>
One of the difficulties in assessing the effect of individual risk behaviours is the tendency for such 
behaviours to be clustered within the same segment of the population.  For example, if one were 
to simply compare smokers with non-smokers, results would be confounded by the fact that a 
higher percentage of smokers drink more heavily than non-smokers.  For this reason Manning 
et al. (1989) not only controlled for age, sex, race, education and family income in their base-
case analysis, but also exercise, self-assessed measures of physical, mental, and general health, 
health insurance coverage and the use of seat belts.  If these factors, apart from income, had not 
been controlled, the external costs of smokers would have seemed 2-fold greater.  <P>
Notably, a recent study which listed Dorothy Rice as an author, took a similar approach and 
controlled for age, race/ethnicity, poverty status, marital status, education level, medical 
insurance status, region of residence, obesity and safety-belt nonuse (Bartlett et al. 1994).  The 
effect of controlling for these variables was not stated.<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME = comparison></A>Comparison of 
Studies</H3>
Studies from Table 1 were excluded from further comparison for the following reasons:  only 
health care costs were calculated (Bartlett et al. 1994; Forbes &amp  Thompson 1983; 
Stoddart et al. 1986; Phillips et al. 1992; Saskatchewan Health 1994);  the presentation of 
results was confusing (Spiegel &amp  Cole 1990);  results were a conversion of earlier results 
using socioeconomic indices (Maynard et al. 1987; Maynard 1989; Rice 1993; Rice et al. 
1991);  state data were derived by simple conversion of national data (Kaplan et al. 1989; 
McCarthy et al. 1993);  the set of estimates was incomplete (ADDC 1992).  As well, the data 
from Manning et al. (1991) was excluded because it was in a format that did not readily allow 
comparison.<P>
Estimates from various countries of the total cost associated with the use of tobacco, alcohol or 
drugs are compared in Table 2 with total cost expressed in three ways:  1) in the local currency 
at the time of the study;  2) in 1993 U.S. dollars;  3) as a percentage of national GDP.  U.S. 
1993 dollars were derived from original estimates by converting from local currency to U.S. 
dollars at the exchange rate current at the time of study and inflating the values to 1993 dollars 
using consumer price indices.  <P>
Tables 3-5 give a more detailed comparison of the major cost components of the studies in 
Table 2, plus additional studies from Canadian provinces and American states   To allow 
comparison among all studies, costs were converted to 1993 U.S. dollars per capita.  The 
population numbers current at the time of the study were used in the per capita calculations.  
<P>
The population, consumer price index and exchange rate data required in the above calculations 
were found in publications of Canadian, British and American governments and of the 
International Monetary Fund.<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME = tobacco></A>Tobacco Studies</H3>
<H4><A NAME = USPHStob></A>US-PHS-type Tobacco 
Studies</H4>
It can be seen in Table 3 that the studies which employed US-PHS methods estimated the total 
cost of tobacco use for the year of study to be between $200 and $300 per capita (1993 U.S. 
dollars).  The corresponding Australian estimate (Collins &amp  Lapsley 1994) shows a total of 
$232.  The estimates of Raynauld &amp  Vidal (1992) are much lower because only external 
costs were included;  i.e. the costs of production forgone through mortality and morbidity were 
excluded. <P>
<A NAME=Table3></A><A HREF="/litrev3.htm">Table 3: Per capita costs of tobacco use (in 1993 U.S. dollars)</A><P>
An indication of the robustness of the US-PHS framework can be gathered by considering all 
American studies which involved SAMMEC and SAMMEC II software, as well as the study 
by Rice et al. (1986) on which the software was based.  The study by Gorsky et al. (1990) can 
also be included because its methods were largely those of Rice et al. (1986).  <P>
One can see that the total costs are generally higher for studies with data sets from 1985 and 
earlier (mean value $322 per capita) than those from 1986 and later (mean value $271).  Direct 
health care costs and indirect morbidity costs were similarly higher for the earlier studies ($122 
vs. $84 and $63 vs. $28, respectively).  This time-related trend at least in part reflected the 
decline in smoking prevalence that occurred in the 1980's.  It might also have reflected the 
change to SAMMEC II technology in the later studies.  One pertinent modification in the newer 
method was the change from calculating mortality and morbidity costs for people aged 20+ to 
calculating those costs for only people aged 35+ (plus optional perinatal diagnoses for 
newborns).  <P>
The same time-related trend was not seen in indirect mortality calculations, although they also 
depended on smoking prevalence data.  This is illustrated by comparing the two New York 
State studies.  Though the earlier study by Smith et al. (1985) used higher prevalence rates, the 
total number of deaths calculated were 10% less than the number calculated in the later study by 
Cummings et al. (1992).  [The difference was not a result of population change].  The difference 
must therefore be attributed to the change with SAMMEC II to the use of risk ratios published 
in the 1989 Surgeon General's report (USDHHS 1989).  These values were two-fold greater 
for the major disease categories than the values used by Rice et al. (1986).<P>
<P><I><U>
</U></I><H4><A NAME = australian></A>Australian Tobacco 
Studies</H4>
Australian estimates of tobacco-attributable costs (Collins &amp  Lapsley 1994) of direct 
health care, indirect mortality and indirect morbidity are generally lower than those for North 
America.  The differences are in part the result of a) a slightly lower per capita GDP in 
Australia;  b) the use of different risk ratios for smoking-attributable diseases, with the 
Australian set of ratios (Holman &amp  Armstrong 1990) being generally lower than the values 
used in SAMMEC II (USDHHS 1989);  c) the use of the demographic method for calculating 
mortality costs in the Australian study;  d) the lower unit medical care cost in Australia 
(Richardson 1991).  The relative contributions of these factors is unknown.  In addition, a large 
component of total cost in the Collins &amp  Lapsley estimate, which is not specified in Table 
3, is the cost of tobacco itself ($87 per capita).  As discussed above, this estimates the value of 
the resources used to produce the portion of tobacco which is consumed in addictive 
consumption.  <P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = canadian></A>Canadian Tobacco Studies</H4>
All Canadian studies, with the exception of Kendall (1992) were based on outdated medical 
evidence.  The relative risks used by Collishaw &amp  Myers (1984) and Choi &amp  
Nethercottt (1988) in their mortality estimates were mainly based on two American data sets 
from the 1960's.   These represented two of the four data sources used by Rice et al. (1986) in 
their derivation of relative risk values.  More recent estimates of the relative risks (USDHHS 
1989) show a marked increase upwards from earlier Surgeon General reports. Thus, the 
estimates by Raynauld &amp  Vidal, which relied on the earlier Surgeon General reports, are 
also out of date.<P>
Although the study by Kendall (1992), which utilized SAMMEC II, was based on the most 
current medical evidence from US-PHS sources, it nevertheless has shortcomings.  One is its 
limited geographical scope;  it was strictly a City of Toronto study.  As well, a significant 
proportion of its data (eg. incidence of medical services utilization) came from U.S. sources, as 
supplied by the SAMMEC II software.<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME = alcohol></A>Alcohol Studies</H3>
<H4><A NAME = total></A>Comparison of Total Costs in Alcohol 
Studies</H4>
The total cost of alcohol relative to national GDP for the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, 
U.S. and Canada, was estimated as 0.5%, 1.4%, 1.7%, 1.9%, 2.7% respectively (Table 2) 
(Adrian et al. 1989; Collins &amp  Lapsley 1991; McDonnel &amp  Maynard 1985; 
Nakamura et al. 1993; Rice et al. 1990).  On the basis of per capita alcohol consumption, one 
would expect the estimates of Australia and especially Britain to be higher in the ranking.  
Similarly, one would not expect the Canadian estimate to be so much higher than the others.  
Thus, the British and Canadian estimates appear to be outliers.<P>
The corresponding per capita cost estimates in Table 3 reflects the ranking indicated by the 
above GDP data.  The US-PHS type studies, both American and Japanese, estimated the total 
costs of alcohol use to be between $400 and $900 per capita in 1993 U.S. dollars.  The 
corresponding estimate by the Australian group (Collins &amp  Lapsley 1991) is somewhat 
lower at $260;  the British one is even lower at $72.  The Canadian study on the other hand, 
though a calculation of only external costs, produced an estimate in the same range as the US-
PHS-type studies.  <P>

Studies</H4>
An examination of the cost components (Table 4) shows that some of the US-PHS alcohol 
studies have a large contribution from indirect morbidity costs.  In fact, the methodology on 
which the morbidity estimates in the Gorsky et al. (1988), Parker et al. (1987) and Nakamura 
et al. (1993) studies were based (Berry &amp  Boland 1977;  Harwood 1984), has been 
thoroughly criticized in a frequently cited study by Heien &amp  Pittman (1989).  The 
methodological flaws in the earlier studies have to a large degree been acknowledged and 
corrected in the more recent study by Rice et al. (1990).  Innovations with respect to the model, 
data set and variables employed have all been introduced and are discussed extensively by Rice 
et al. (1990).  Within the discussion it is acknowledged that even if one were to accept the data 
limitations under which Harwood et al. (1984) worked, proper application of their analysis 
would have yielded an alcohol impairment coefficient of 12.9% instead of 21%.  Even this 
adjustment alone would have reduced the morbidity costs in the Gorsky et al. (1988), Parker et 
al. (1987) (higher estimate) and Nakamura (1993) studies by 40%.  Corresponding total cost 
estimates would have been 23, 23 and 26% lower, respectively.  <P>
<A NAME=Table4></A><A HREF="/litrev4.htm">Table 4: Per capita costs of alcohol use (in 1993 U.S. dollars)</A><P>
Rice et al. (1990) also introduced a new procedure for estimating short term hospital costs, 
which is the largest component of total direct health care costs in the case of alcohol.  They 
acknowledged the criticism of Heien &amp  Pittman (1989) that the earlier estimates had been 
based on attributable fractions which were a) non-conservative  b) a poor estimate of the mean 
of reported values and c) sometimes applied to conditions in which causality had not yet been 
established.  It should be noted that these criticisms would also be applicable to the estimates of 
direct health care costs by Gorsky et al. (1988), Parker et al. (1987) and Nakamura et al. 
(1993).  <P>
In the Rice et al. (1990) study, they relied on only those primary diagnoses and secondary 
diagnoses which were alcohol-related by definition.  The cost associated with a secondary 
diagnosis was derived by assuming that for any given primary diagnosis, the additional time 
spent in the hospital that could be associated with an alcohol-attributable secondary diagnosis 
was in fact attributable to that secondary diagnosis.  Using this approach, 73% of the alcohol-
attributable hospital costs were associated with a primary diagnosis and 27% with a secondary 
diagnosis. [N.B. 73% was derived by dividing $2189 million in Table 19 by $3017 million in 
Table 3 in Rice et al. (1990)].  The method employed by Rice et al. (1990) was a relatively 
conservative one in that physicians, who assigned the diagnoses on which the calculations were 
based, would have been reluctant or unable to identify alcohol-related problems upon 
presentation of attributable diseases or accidents (Thornton 1990).  Accordingly, the estimates 
of direct health care costs in the Rice et al. (1990) study were markedly lower than estimates 
based on earlier methods (Gorsky et al. 1988; Nakamura 1993; Parker et al. 1987).<P>
The Rice et al. (1990) methodology for determining production losses due to premature 
mortality did not differ greatly from that used by the other US-PHS type studies.  Accordingly, 
its estimate of 135 dollars per capita lies between that made by Parker et al. (1987) and 
Gorsky et al. (1988) ($112 and $163 respectively).  Rice et al. (1990) stated that the 
attributable fractions used were based on consultations with NIAAA and recent references.  In 
fact, they consist largely of the same values used in earlier studies.  These estimates would 
therefore be considered non-conservative estimates of questionable validity by Heien &amp  
Pittman (1989), as discussed above.<P>
Unlike the American studies, the one by Nakamura et al. (1993) estimated only $67 for indirect 
mortality costs.  They correctly attributed the difference in part to the 3-fold lower incidence of 
death by injury or poisoning in Japan.  This would have had a significant effect on their results in 
that injuries comprised one-third of the total deaths in the Rice analysis and injuries plus violence 
(suicide and homicide) comprised one-half (Rice et al. 1990).<P>
A major component of the alcohol-attributable mortality in US-PHS studies were those deaths 
arising from motor vehicle collisions;  these comprised 24% of all alcohol-attributable mortality 
in the case of Rice et al. (1990).  The previously discussed US-PHS studies all used an alcohol-
attributable fraction between 50 and 55%.  Of interest then to future researchers would be the 
decrease of this value to 42% by Shultz et al. (1991a) following their review of the 
literature.<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = otheralc></A>Other Alcohol Studies Outside of 
Canada</H4>
Results of an Australian estimate of the economic costs of alcohol is also presented in Table 4 
(Collins &amp  Lapsley 1991).  Differences between this study and that of Rice et al. (1990) 
would be in part be the net result of the following factors, though their relative contribution is 
unknown:  a) the larger list of diagnoses used by Collins &amp  Lapsley in the estimation of 
hospital costs;  b) the use by Collins &amp  Lapsley of attributable fractions estimated by 
Holman &amp  Armstrong (1990);  c) the use of the demographic method by Collins &amp  
Lapsley for calculating mortality costs;  d) the lower unit medical care cost in Australia 
(Richardson 1991);  e) the slightly lower per capita GDP in Australia;  f) the inclusion of 30% of 
the cost of alcohol by Collins &amp  Lapsley (1991)<P>
The estimate by Collins &amp  Lapsley (1991) of the loss of production attributable to alcohol-
related morbidity is much lower than that of the U.S. studies.  This resulted from Collins &amp  
Lapsley including only the production which resulted in the administration of medical services, 
i.e. short-term and long-term disability.  Although they also acknowledged absenteeism as 
another cost, they were unable to estimate it.  In contrast, the US-PHS studies were based on a 
more encompassing concept of the impairment of productivity.  By measuring the effect of 
alcohol use on personal income, an attempt was made at capturing all of the various 
components of income loss identified by Cruze et al. (1981):  lower occupational achievement;  
reduced labour force participation;  increased unemployment;  increased part-time work;  
absenteeism and tardiness;  reduced productivity on the job.  <P>
As mentioned above, the total cost estimate presented by McDonnel &amp  Maynard (1985), 
equivalent to 0.5% of the British GDP, appeared markedly lower than estimates from other 
countries.  Richardson (1991) in his review considered the McDonnel &amp  Maynard (1985) 
approach to be especially conservative.  Indeed, in several instances McDonnel &amp  
Maynard gave new evidence for higher values;  but in most cases they nevertheless chose to use 
lower values derived from an earlier study (Holtermann &amp  Burchell 1981).   <P>
Reference to other studies suggests some of the various components of the McDonnel &amp  
Maynard (1989) calculations are indeed minimized.  For example, their health care estimates 
indicated that 2.5% of in-patient days in non-psychiatric hospitals were alcohol-attributable.  
This contrasts with a Canadian study in which, following careful analysis, 7.2% of inpatient days 
were attributable to just the primary diagnoses with an alcohol or drug use related illness 
(Thornton et al. 1990).  Mortality estimates seem low too, for their figures indicated 13 alcohol-
attributable deaths per 100,000.  The corresponding figures for Japan, New Hampshire, 
Australia and Canada were respectively 24, 35, 38 and 60 (Adrian et al. 1989; Gorsky 1988; 
Holman &amp  Armstrong 1990; Nakamura 1993).  It also seems that McDonnel &amp  
Maynard did not include the value of housework lost through premature mortality;  in this way 
too their estimate would be lower than that of US-PHS type studies.  Finally, regarding indirect 
morbidity costs, which is the most controversial component to measure, McDonnel &amp  
Maynard again chose to estimate conservatively.  The estimate of this component was so much 
lower than that of other studies, Richardson (1991) chose to disregard it when attempting to 
extrapolate foreign data to Australia.  <P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = cdnalcohol></A>Canadian Alcohol 
Studies</H4>
The only recent Canadian estimate of alcohol costs has been the estimates of external costs by 
Adrian et al. (1989), which is a modification of a method by Holmes (1976).  This represents 
one of the later of a series of estimates published by the Addiction Research Foundation (ARF) 
in Toronto, Ontario.  The method has been borrowed in part or in whole by various institutions 
in other provinces (ADDC 1992;  CLEU 1992; Saskatchewan Health 1994).  Its attraction has 
been at least in part its ease and rapidity of use.  However, as other methods have developed 
elsewhere, the approach has seemed increasingly crude, even with the more recent innovation of 
using actual morbidity data instead of substituting mortality data.<P>
Even if one were to accept the fact that the ARF method should be a simple one, therefore 
justifying the use of aggregate data, one would still be able to criticize the approach for using the 
estimate of excess morbidity from all alcohol-attributable illnesses for estimates of excess 
accidents in the workplace and excess law infractions.  <P>
As discussed above, the estimate of the total cost of alcohol use by Adrian et al. (1989) seems 
high when compared with estimates from other countries. Furthermore, their estimate of 
alcohol-attributable direct health care costs also seem especially high.  Whereas Adrian et al. 
(1989) estimated that such costs would be 22% of total health care costs, Gorsky et al. (1988) 
estimated 10% for New Hampshire and Nakamura et al. (1993) 7% for Japan.  One should 
note too, as discussed above, even the estimates by Gorsky et al. (1988) and Nakamura et al. 
(1993) are not considered conservative (Heien &amp  Pittman 1989).  The apparent 
overestimation by Adrian et al. (1989) might in part be attributable to the use of a composite 
morbidity risk ratio, as noted by Collins &amp  Lapsley (1991).  The validity of this ratio could 
also be suspect if it were derived from abusers in treatment, as was apparently the case for their 
drug morbidity ratio (CLEU 1992) presented in the same study (Adrian 1989).<P>

<H4><A NAME = compdrug></A>Comparison of Total Costs in 
Drug Studies</H4>
Table 5 compares the costs of drug studies standardized to 1993 U.S. dollars per capita.  Wide 
variety is seen.  The highest estimate among them is the Canadian one by Adrian et al. (1989) of 
the Addiction Research Foundation (Toronto, Ontario) where $500 per capita is attributed to 
combined illicit and licit drug use ($200 and $300 per capita respectively).  When the Co-
ordinated Law Enforcement Unit in British Columbia used the ARF method (Adrian et al. 
1988), they in accordance, estimated costs of $200 per capita for illicit drug use (CLEU 1992).  
In contrast, the much more detailed study of Rice et al. (1990) gave an estimate of only $250 
per capita for the costs of both illicit and licit drugs in the U.S.  One would not expect Canadian 
estimates to be double that of the U.S., especially when one considers the incidence of drug-
related mortality for Canada and the U.S. are 1.8 per 100,000 (in 1986-87) and 2.6 per 
100,000 (in 1985) respectively (Rice et al. 1990; Single et al. 1994).  Furthermore, whereas 
cocaine had been used once in the previous year by 0.7% of Canadians in 1985 (Single et al. 
1994), the corresponding figure for the U.S. was 5.0% (Rice et al. 1990).<P>
<A NAME=Table5></A><A HREF="/litrev5.htm">Table 5: Per capita costs of drug use (in 1993 U.S. dollars)</A><P>
A comparison of total costs relative to GDP (Table 2) also suggests that application of the ARF 
method produced results which are outliers.  Whereas the Adrian et al. (1990) estimate was 
2.6% of GDP for the costs of both illicit and licit drugs, the corresponding value for the U.S. 
was only 1.1% (Rice et al. 1990).  Similarly, whereas the Canadian estimate for illicit drugs was 
1.0%, that of Switzerland and Australia were 0.2% (Institut suisse de prophylaxie de 
l'alcoolisme 1990) and 0.4% (Collins &amp  Lapsley 1991).  <P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = swiss></A>Swiss Drug Study</H4>
The Institut suisse de prophylaxie de l'alcoolisme (1990), using a method comparable to that of 
Rice et al. (1990), estimated that the per capita cost of illicit drugs in Switzerland was only one-
quarter that of the corresponding value for all drugs in the United States (Rice et al. 1990).  
Comparing these costs relative to GDP shows even further disparity:  0.2% and 1.1% for the 
Swiss and U.S. studies respectively.  This is somewhat surprising, since the estimate of heroin 
addicts for the two countries in 1985 were about the same: 0.15-0.22%  (Institut suisse de 
prophylaxie de l'alcoolisme 1990) and 0.21% (Rice et al. 1990).  Closer examination shows 
that the major difference between the two studies lies primarily in the crime associated costs.  
Sixty percent of this category in the American study was comprised of the production loss 
associated with the following: injuries suffered by victims of crime;  incarceration of criminals;  
time spent in crime careers.  The Swiss study did not include such estimates.  <P>
The Institut suisse de prophylaxie de l'alcoolisme (1990) introduced a novel approach to their 
estimation of mortality and morbidity costs in that they accounted for the present lowered 
capacity for production by an abuser.  For current abusers of narcotics, they assumed an 
income-generating capacity 50% that of the Swiss average.  Thus, morbidity losses by those 
undergoing full-time treatment in a hospital or on full-time disability for their drug problems were 
assessed at this rate of earning;  those who were treated as outpatients were considered to lose 
10% of this 50%-impaired productivity.  For each of the drug-related deaths in 1985 (average 
age, 25 yrs.), they assigned a value equivalent to production at 50% the Swiss average for 5 
years, increasing by 10% over each of the next 4 years, to 90% for the remaining working 
years, all converted to present day values by a discount factor of 4%.  This addresses the 
problem for which Rice et al. (1990) has been criticized in that while people live as substance 
abusers, they die as non-abusers (Heien &amp  Pittman 1989).<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = otherdrug></A>Other Drug Studies Outside of 
Canada</H4>
The estimate of total cost of illicit drug use in Australia (Collins &amp  Lapsley 1991) was 
equivalent to 0.4% of GDP (Table 2).  Notably this would decrease to 0.2% if one were to 
remove the value of the drugs, a cost none of the other above studies included.  Results would 
then be approximately in accordance with the Swiss results, which would be appropriate given 
the similar rates of illicit drug use, as indicated by the similar mortality statistics of 2.9 per 
100,000 in Australia (Holman &amp  Armstrong 1990) and 3.1 per 100,000 in Switzerland 
(Institut suisse de prophylaxie de l'alcoolisme 1990).  Like the Swiss study and unlike the 
American study, the one by Collins &amp  Lapsley (1991) did not assess the costs of lost 
production associated with victims of crimes, incarcerated criminals or criminal careers.<P>
The British study by Fazey and Stevenson (1990) is not comparable to the others because it 
only assessed external costs.  No costs of lost production due to morbidity or mortality were 
assigned because they were considered to be internal costs.  Thus, the majority of costs were 
those associated with crime and notably 81% of these were attributed to the cost of stolen 
goods.  It should be noted that the cost associated with stolen goods wasn't included in cost-of-
illness estimates because it represented a resource transferred instead of one lost.<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = cdndrug></A>Canadian Drug Studies</H4>
As discussed at the beginning of the section, estimates derived using the Adrian et al. (1989) 
method lack credibility because they are so much higher than those of other countries, when 
considered relative to GDP or in absolute amounts per capita.  Their estimate of health 
expenditures appears especially suspect when compared against that of other countries.  The 
approach can also be faulted conceptually for substituting the estimate of the excess morbidity 
from all drug-attributable illnesses for estimates of excess accidents in the workplace and excess 
law infractions.  As well, it is odd that social welfare costs were included in the 1988 ARF 
estimates for drug costs (Adrian et al. 1988;  according to CLEU (1990)) and in the 1989 
estimates for alcohol costs, but not in the 1989 estimates for drug costs (Adrian et al. 
1989).<P>
The CLEU (1992) decided against using the Adrian et al. (1988) method in the main part of 
their study, because of uncertainty about the validity of the excess morbidity rate on which most 
of the ARF estimate is based.  According to CLEU (1990), the morbidity rate had been 
derived by studying abusers in treatment and had not been shown to be valid for the entire 
population of users.  The CLEU showed application of the ARF formula for calculation of 
health care costs produced incredibly high estimates relative to provincial health care costs.  
Unfortunately, the CLEU group did not provide an adequate health care cost estimate in their 
own study;  this is a major shortcoming of their study.  They provided a minimum estimate by 
including only the cost of programs dedicated to substance use, but did not include the cost of 
the treatment of drug-related illnesses and accidents in hospitals and general practitioners' 
offices.  On the other hand, the CLEU was comprehensive in their estimate of law enforcement 
costs;  this estimate was significantly more than the one of ARF.<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME = estimates></A>Comparison of 
Estimates for All Substances</H3>
Table 2 allows comparisons across substances.  One can readily do this for the United States 
using the data of Rice et al. (1986; 1990) and for Australia using the data of Collins &amp  
Lapsley (1991; 1994).  One sees that for the United States and Australia, respectively, the 
costs of illicit drug use (1.1 % and 0.4% of GDP) are outstripped by those of tobacco (2.0% 
and 1.4%) and alcohol (1.7% and 1.4% of GDP).  This suggests that significant investment in 
the prevention and treatment of abusers of all three substances is worthwhile.  The degree to 
which money should be directed towards a particular substance would have to be determined in 
part by cost-effectiveness studies.<P>
Of interest too, is the analysis of external costs by Manning et al. (1991), in which it was shown 
that the external cost of alcohol was shown to be covered to a lesser extent by its excise tax 
than that of tobacco.<P>
<P><B>
</B><H2><A NAME = 
summary></A>SUMMARY AND 
CONCLUSIONS</H2>
An overview of studies concerned with assessing the economic cost of the abuse of tobacco, 
alcohol or drugs has been presented.  It showed that there are at least three major 
methodological approaches which can be identified in the literature and that none of them have 
been used recently to provide national estimates for Canada.  Several methodological issues 
were also identified in the literature and a discussion has been provided.<P>
Comparison of Canadian tobacco studies with those from other countries shows that some 
Canadian estimates are outdated because of changing prevalence rates and advances in medical 
understanding.  One recent City of Toronto study exists, but it is limited in its applicability to the 
rest of Canada and it relies to a fair degree on American data.<P>
Comparison of Canadian alcohol and drug studies with those from other countries suggests that 
the national estimates for Canada are overstated.  A British Columbia estimate of illicit drug 
costs exists, but it has limited applicability to the rest of Canada and did not adequately deal 
with hospital costs.<P>
Australia, Switzerland and the United States have all employed indigenously developed, 
rigorous methodologies.  Canada has yet to do the same.<P>

<A NAME = Exec></A><H2>Executive Summary</H2>
The use of alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs involves a wide variety of adverse 
health and social consequences. There is a strong need for improved estimates of the economic 
costs of substance abuse. Cost estimates help to prioritize substance abuse issues, provide useful 
information for targeting programming, and identify information gaps. The development of 
improved cost estimates also offers the potential to develop more complete cost-benefit analyses of 
policies and programmes aimed at reducing the harm associated with the use of psychoactive 
substances. <P>
This document presents a general framework for the development of cost estimates. Studies of the 
economic costs of substance abuse are described as a type of cost-of-illness study in which the 
impact of substance abuse on the material welfare of a society is estimated by examining the social 
costs of treatment, prevention, research, law enforcement and lost productivity plus some measure 
of the quality of life years lost, relative to a counterfactual scenario in which there is no substance 
abuse. A matrix of the types of costs to be considered is presented, and there is a detailed 
discussion of the theoretical issues involved, including: the definition of abuse, determination of 
causality, comparison of the demographic and human capital approaches to cost estimation, the 
treatment and measurement of addictive consumption, the treatment of private costs, the 
measurement of intangible costs, the treatment of non-workforce mortality and morbidity, the 
treatment of research, education, law enforcement costs, the estimation of avoidable costs and 
budgetary impact of substance abuse. <P>
The guidelines conclude with a brief discussion of future directions, with particular attention to the 
expansion of economic cost studies to developing countries, and the implications of these guidelines 
to research agendas and data collection systems.<P>
<HR>
<H3>Notes:</H3>
<A NAME = FN1></A>(1)  These guidelines are based on the First International Symposium on Estimating the 
Economic and Social Costs of Substance Abuse, held in Banff, Alberta, Canada, in May of 1994 and the Second 
International Symposium on Estimating the Economic and Social Costs of Substance Abuse, held in Montebello, 
Quebec, Canada, in October of 1995. They have been prepared by a working group consisting of Eric Single

<H1>AIDS and Drug Use</H1>
<I><H4>by Diane Riley and Diane McKenzie, Canadian Centre 
on Substance Abuse</H4></I>
<HR>
<H3>Highlights</H3>
<UL>
<LI>About 11,529 Canadians have developed AIDS since 1977; of these, 8,199 have died.
<LI>HIV prevalence rates among injection drug users in Montreal, Quebec and Ottawa are already very 
high.
<LI>HIV incidence rates in some Canadian cities are among the highest in North America.
<LI>More than one per cent of inmates of federal correctional institutions have HIV or AIDS. In some 
institutions, as many as five per cent of the inmate population are HIV-positive. Few measures are in place 
to check the spread of HIV in prisons.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>Overview</H2>
Drug use puts an individual at risk for infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other 
pathogens such as hepatitis. Injection drug use poses direct risk of infection through sharing of 
contaminated drug equipment. Non-injection drug use, including alcohol use, poses indirect risks of 
infection in that it can increase the likelihood of unsafe sexual and drug-injecting practices (see Riley, 
MacKenzie, Hankins et al., 1995, for an overview). This chapter focuses on the relationship between HIV 
and injection drug use, because there is little information about the relationship between HIV and non-
injection drug use.<P>
<H2>Sources of Information</H2>
Information about AIDS, HIV, hepatitis, injecting behaviour and related high-risk behaviour is limited. 
Two sources are used to track changing infection patterns in the Canadian population: Health and Welfare 
Canada's Quarterly Surveillance update on AIDS is the main source of information for following new 
AIDS cases and deaths across the country. Surveys of user populations in cities and of inmates of 
correctional facilities help monitor the spread of HIV and AIDS in high-risk populations. <P>
<H2>AIDS and Injection Drug Use</H2>
Only a small proportion of drug users inject drugs, but those who do are particularly at risk of infection by 
HIV and hepatitis. Globally, injection drug use is a primary risk factor for the transmission of the HIV. In 
Canada, injection drug use is second only to homosexual/bisexual activity as a means of HIV transmission 
in men, and second only to heterosexual acquisition in women. Transmission occurs when blood is 
transferred from one person to another by sharing unclean needles, syringes or other drug 
paraphernalia.<P>
In 1991, it was estimated that approximately 100,000 injection drug users in Canada were at risk for HIV 
infection through sharing needles and syringes (Addiction Research Foundation [ARF], 1991). These 
individuals are concentrated, for the most part, in the metropolitan areas of Montreal, Toronto and 
Vancouver, but there are injection drug users in most urban and rural areas of Canada.<P>
Traditionally, heroin has been the main drug administered by injection in Canada; Talwin and Ritalin 
have also been popular injectables at various times in different parts of the country. Over the last several 
years, cocaine has been used increasingly by injection drug users, either on its own or in combination with 
heroin. There is also increasing non-medical use of anabolic steroids by athletes, dancers and the general 
male population throughout Canada.<P>
In Canada, as in other countries, the heterosexual transmission of HIV infection is fueled by the spread of 
infection among injection drug users. HIV infection spreads from injection drug users to their sexual 
partners. About one-third of injection drug users are female. It is estimated that at least 40% of injection 
drug users are in relationships with non-users. There is also a risk that babies will be infected through 
perinatal transmission of the virus.<P>
About 11,529 Canadians have developed AIDS since 1977. Of these, 8,199 have died (Health Canada, 
1995). Between 1985 and 1992, the number of AIDS cases increased dramatically. The number of new 
cases increased between 1987 and 1988 and has remained high (ranging from 892 in 1987 to 1,529 in 
1992).<P>
The majority of AIDS cases occur among those between age 20 and 49, proportionately as follows: 30 to 
39 (44.0%), 40 to 49 (26.5%) and 20 to 29 (17.8%). About 41.5% of AIDS cases occur in Ontario, 29.7% 
in Quebec, 17.6% in British Columbia and 6.4% in Alberta. AIDS-related mortality follows a similar 
regional pattern. To date, the vast majority of deaths due to AIDS-related causes have occurred in Ontario 
(n=3,969) and Quebec (n=2,084).<P>
Compared with New York and Milan, where HIV infection prevalence levels among injection drug users 
are more than 50%, HIV rates among Canadian injection drug users are low to moderate. However, by 
comparison with a number of European and Australian cities, where, in many cases, infection rates 
remain below 5%, rates in some Canadian regions are already high. For example, in British Columbia, 
prevalence increased from 3% to 6% between 1992 and 1995 (BC Ministry of Health, 1995). In Toronto, a 
1994 survey of injection drug users reported a seropositivity rate of 7.6%  compared with a rate of 4.8% in 
1992/93 (Millson, personal communication, 1994). In Montreal, rates range between 10% and 22%, 
depending on the testing site (Bruneau, Cloutier, Hankins, Morissette, personal communications, 1995). 
In Quebec and Ottawa, prevalence rates are about 10% (Health Canada, 1995).<P>
The incidence rates of HIV among injection drug users in some Canadian cities are now very high. 
Montreal and Vancouver have incidence rates of more than 5% (Health Canada, 1995), among the highest 
in North America.<P>
Clearly, both prevalence and incidence rates of HIV infection among injection drug users are already high 
in a number of Canadian cities. Intensive prevention efforts are needed immediately (Riley, MacKenzie, 
Hankins et al., 1995). Experts from around the world indicate that once levels of infection among 
injection drug users reach 10%, the epidemic can become explosive (Hankins, 1993). A comprehensive 
harm reduction approach to AIDS and drug use is required to keep rates of HIV infection low in Canada. 
Such an approach would involve ready availability of clean syringes, access to flexible and liberal 
methadone programs and an end to the marginalization and criminalization of drug users (Riley, 1993, 
1994).<P>
<H2>Correctional Institutions</H2>
Rates among injection drug users in correctional institutions reflect the levels of infection in the drug 
injecting community outside the institution. For example, among inmates who inject drugs in provincial 
prisons in Quebec, 8% of men and 13% of women are HIV-positive (Hankins et al., 1991, 1994). <P>
Studies of federal jails in B.C. and Ontario found that about 1% of the inmates tested were infected with 
HIV, about 10 times the rate in the general public (Calzavara, 1993; Rothon, 1993). The highest rates of 
infection were among prisoners with a history of injection drug use (2.1% for B.C.; 3.8% for Ontario).<P>
As of August, 1995, 152 inmates were known to have HIV or AIDS in federal prisons in Canada (CSC, 
1995). This represents more than 1% of federal inmates. In some institutions, especially in Quebec, close 
to 5% of inmates are HIV-positive (Jurgens, 1995).<P>
There is now evidence of the rapid spread of hepatitis B and C in prisons. Between January and August, 
1995, 223 new cases of active hepatitis C and 22 new cases of hepatitis B were reported in federal prisons 
in Canada (CSC, 1995). These data suggest that there is potential for the rapid spread of HIV in 
prisons.<P>
Three studies in Canadian prisons found hepatitis C seroprevalence rates of between 28% and 40% 
(Jurgens, 1995). Hepatitis C is usually spread by either blood transfusion or sharing of contaminated drug 
paraphernalia. Sexual transmission of hepatitis C is a less common form of transmission. Among inmates 
of correctional institutions, hepatitis C-positivity is a probable marker of injection drug use. These data 
suggest that there is a very marked potential for a rise in HIV rates.<P>
Many individuals report sharing injection equipment for the first time in prison; others first use drugs and 
first inject drugs in prison. There are few measures in place to check the spread of HIV in institutions 
(ECAP, 1994; Jurgens, 1995; Riley, 1992). <P>

<H3>Highlights</H3>
<UL>
<LI>In 1993, there were 194,916 liquor act offences in Canada, representing 63% of offences reported 
under provincial statutes (excluding traffic offences). 
<LI>There were 117,567 drinking and driving offences in Canada during 1993. The number has 
generally been declining since 1983. The rate per 100,000 age 16 or older has declined an average 4.6% 
per year over the period 1984-1993.
<LI>In 1993, there were 56,811 drug-related offences, a slight increase of 0.6% from the previous year. 
Cannabis-related offences accounted for 63% of the total while cocaine-related offences accounted for an 
additional 22%.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>Sources of Information</H2>
This chapter deals with offences under the provincial liquor acts, federal drinking and driving legislation, 
and federal drug offences that fall under the<I> Narcotic Control Act</I> and <I>Food and Drugs 
Act</I>. For a description of the acts, types of offences and associated penalties, please see Chapter 
11.<P>
Most of the data reported in this chapter are based on police-reported offences and charges recorded using 
the Uniform Crime Reporting system. "Offence" data represent a count of identified legal violations, 
while "charges" refer to the number of persons actually charged in connection with the offences. In 
general, if a person is charged with several offences, only the most serious offence or charge is reported. 
This results in fewer charges than offences and the under-reporting of charges for many less serious 
violations. <P>
<H2>Liquor Acts</H2>
The control and sale of liquor in Canada is regulated by legislation and enforcement policy in each 
province. Thus, interprovincial comparisons should be conducted with care.<P>
In 1993, there were 194,916 liquor act offences in Canada, representing 63% of offences reported under 
provincial statutes (excluding traffic offences). Since 1984, the total number of offences has declined by 
29%.<P>
Nationally, the rate per 100,000 population for liquor act offences in 1993 was 677.9, a decline of 7.4% 
from 1992. Regionally, rates of liquor act offences were highest in the Northwest Territories (4,756.8 per 
100,000), the Yukon (3,003.1), and Prince Edward Island (2,746.0). The lowest offence rate was in 
Quebec with 31.3 offences per 100,000 population. <P>
The number of juveniles involved in provincial liquor act offences declined 13.8% to 14,329 in 1993. This 
was the sixth year in a row that the rate has dropped. The number of adults charged under provincial 
liquor act offences was 111,727 (516.0 charges per 100,000 adults), down 13.3% from 1992. The average 
annual reduction in nine years between 1984 and 1993 is 5.7%. In general, about 90% of the adults 
charged in any given year were male.<P>
There were 5,071 reported sentenced admissions to provincial adult correctional service facilities for 
violating the provincial liquor acts in 1993-94. Liquor act offences accounted for 8% of all sentenced 
admissions to provincial correction facilities. Provincially, Quebec accounts for 88% of total sentenced 
admissions.<P>
<H3>Drinking and Driving Offences</H3>
In 1993, there were 117,567 drinking and driving offences in Canada. The number of drinking and 
driving offences across Canada has been declining at the average rate of 3.3% per year from 1984 to 1993. 
The rate of offences per 100,000 population age 16 or over has also declined an average of 4.6% per year 
over the period 1984 to 1993. All regions of Canada, with the exception of the Northwest Territories and 
Saskatchewan, have experienced significant declines in the rate of drinking and driving offences. The 
highest rates were recorded in the Yukon (2,477), the Northwest Territories (1,655), Saskatchewan 
(1,248) and Alberta (1,170). Ontario and Quebec continued to have the lowest rates of drinking and 
driving offences at 335 and 414 respectively.<P>
"Impaired operation of motor vehicle" offences accounted for about 91% (107,407 offences) of drinking 
and driving offences in 1993. Failure or refusal to provide a breath or blood sample accounted for an 
additional 7% (8,736 offences). The more serious offence of impaired operation of motor vehicle causing 
death accounted for 0.2% (181 offences) of drinking and driving offences, while impaired operation of a 
motor vehicle causing bodily harm accounted for 1.1% (1,243 offences). <P>
In 1993 there were 92,539 people charged with alcohol related traffic offences or 413 charges per 100,000 
population age 16 and over. Men accounted for over 90% of all charges in each year from 1990 to 
1993.<P>
There were 13,054 sentenced admissions to provincial adult correctional service facilities for drinking and 
driving offences in 1993/94 (Table 12.10), accounting for 17% of all correctional facility admissions. The 
number increased 34.6% from the previous year, but this is primarily because Ontario reported for the first 
time since 1990/91.<P>
<H2>Drug-related Crime</H2>
The interpretation of drug-related crime statistics is difficult. As noted in one of the original source 
materials, "a change in police-reported drug offences does not mean that there was a corresponding 
increase or decrease in drug usage but may in fact reflect changes in police enforcement practices" 
(Statistics Canada, <I>Canadian Crime Statistics 1990</I>, p. 45).<P>
In 1993, there were 56,811 drug-related offences, 0.6% higher than the level recorded in 1992. This 
corresponded to a rate of 197.6 per 100,000 population. Offences involving cannabis accounted for 63% of 
the total, while cocaine offences accounted for 22%. Heroin offences increased 26.9% in 1993 and 
accounted for 2.8% of total drug offences. The highest rate of drug-related offences was recorded in the 
Northwest Territories (591.4 per 100,000) followed by the Yukon (459.4 per 100,000) and British 
Columbia (388.3 per 100,000). The lowest rate of drug offences was in Newfoundland (135.1 per 
100,000).<P>
In 1993, the number of juvenile offenders involved in drug-related offences under federal drug legislation 
increased 30% to 3,426 offences. This follows a period from 1986 to 1992, when the number of juvenile 
offenders declined an average of 7.6% per year. Offences committed under the Narcotic Control Act 
(NCA) made up 82% of total drug-related offences. Cannabis accounted for a majority of the offences 
under the NCA (85.3% of its total) and 70.2% of total drug-related offences under the federal drug 
acts.<P>
In 1993, 39,424 adults were charged with drug-related offences under federal legislation. The rate of 
charges per 100,000 adults for 1993 was 182.1, 6.4% lower than the rate recorded in 1992. The territories 
continued to record the highest rates (611.3 charges per 100,000 adults in the N.W.T. and 441.6 in the 
Yukon). The lowest rate of offences occurred in New Brunswick (94.9 per 100,000 adults). As was the 
case with alcohol-related charges, males accounted for the majority of drug related charges in 1993 
(85.7%).<P>
(It should be noted that data relating to the disposition of charges and convictions is from the Bureau of 
Drug Surveillance, Health Canada, and do not include convictions for offences involving cannabis. All 
data for 1994 in tables 12.16 through 12.20 are preliminary estimates.)<P>
According to preliminary estimates, of the 14,153 charges that reached disposition in 1994, 10,279 
(72.6%) resulted in convictions. More than half (62% or 6,376) of all convictions resulted in prison 
sentences, while 26% were handled with fines and 7% resulted in a suspended sentence or probation. 
<P><U>
</U>Charges under the <I>Narcotic Control Act</I> accounted for 90% of all federal drug convictions, 
while convictions involving controlled drugs in the <I>Food and Drugs Act </I>(FDA) represented 10% 
of the total. Forty-seven per cent (47%) of all convictions were for possession, 32% for trafficking, 19% 
possession for the purpose of trafficking, 1% for multiple doctoring and 1% for importing. Men accounted 
for 86% of all drug-related convictions. Persons under age 30 accounted for 50% of the drug-related 
convictions, while those age 30 to 39 accounted for 35%.<P>
In 1992-93, there were 782 admissions to federal adult correctional institutions for drug-related offences, 
up 6.8% from the year before. Drug-related admissions represented 14% of all admissions to federal 
correctional institutions.<P><U>
</U>The number of reported thefts and other losses involving drugs controlled under the NCA and FDA 
declined 13% in 1994. Most thefts and losses occurred at pharmacies or hospitals, accounting for 90% of 
reported losses during 1994. Provincially, Ontario had the highest number of reported theft and other 
losses (508 cases), accounting for 52% of thefts across Canada.<P><U>
</U>The number of reported prescription forgeries decreased by 36% to 1,022 in 1994. Forgeries 
involving codeine accounted for 49% of all prescription forgeries in 1994. <P><U>

<TITLE>Canadian Profile 1996: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><H3>Canadian Profile 1996</H3>
<H1>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome</H1><B>
<I></B><H4>by Diane McKenzie, Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse</H4>
</I><HR>
<H3>Highlights</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) involves growth deficiencies, central nervous system problems and a 
characteristic face with short eye openings, a thin upper lip and a flattened groove in the middle of the 
upper lip. FAS can occur depending on how much the mother drinks when she's pregnant and the 
characteristics of the mother or fetus. Binge drinking is the pattern associated with FAS.
<LI>In 1992/93, 18 pregnant women across Canada were diagnosed as damaging the fetus because of 
their drinking, and 74 babies were treated because of "noxious influences transmitted via the placenta or 
breast milk". 
<LI>In 1992/93, 250 pregnant women were treated for drug dependence. Thirty per cent were between 
age 20 and 24 and more than half were between 25 and 34. Only 10 cases of suspected damage to the fetus 
were reported. Approximately 72 cases of drug withdrawal syndrome in the new-born and 18 cases of 
suspected damage to the fetus were reported. 
<LI>About 0.33 cases of FAS occur in every 1,000 births in western countries; about 100 children are 
born in Canada each year with FAS. The incidence of FAS in some Native communities is much higher 
than other parts of Canada.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>Terminology</H2>
The effect of alcohol on the fetus was first described in 1973 (Jones and Smith, 1973). Since that time, 
more than 5,000 articles have been published on the topic (Abel and Sokol, 1990). Studies show that 
drinking during pregnancy can result in a variety of alcohol-related birth defects known as the fetal 
alcohol syndrome (FAS). This syndrome is defined by growth deficiencies (prenatal and/or postnatal 
growth retardation with weight and/or length below the 10th percentile), central nervous system 
involvement (including neurological abnormalities, developmental delays, behavioural dysfunction, 
intellectual impairment, and skull or brain malformations) and a characteristic face (with short palpebral 
fissures [eye openings], a thin upper lip and an elongated, flattened philtrum [the groove in the middle of 
the upper lip]) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1991). When some, but not all of these 
abnormalities are found and prenatal alcohol use is a possible cause, the term fetal alcohol effects (FAE) is 
used. FAS and FAE are life-long disorders (Ashley, 1994).<P>
The occurrence of FAS and FAE depends on how much the mother drinks during pregnancy, in 
combination with other factors (Ashley, 1994). These factors relate to the use of alcohol and the 
characteristics of the mother or fetus. For example, the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumed 
during pregnancy, the stage of fetal development at the time of its exposure, the nutritional status of the 
mother, use of other drugs, the genetic background of the mother and fetus and the mother's state of 
health affect the development of FAS (Michaelis and Michaelis, 1994). The age, weight, number of 
children and smoking habits of the mother are important as well. Binge drinking is the pattern associated 
with FAS. Some racial groups or subgroups may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of alcohol 
because of differences in the way alcohol is metabolized (May, 1991; Ashley, 1994). The primary 
metabolic product of alcohol, acetaldehyde, may be responsible for some FAS effects (Michaelis and 
Michaelis, 1994). <P>
<H2>The Effect of Alcohol During Stages of 
Fetal Development</H2>
The consumption of large quantities of alcohol during two stages of human development can lead to FAS. 
The first stage is the <I>embryonic period</I> (up to eight weeks of gestation) and the second stage is the 
<I>fetal period</I> (from eight weeks to delivery). During the embryonic period, abnormalities can be 
produced by different drugs that enter the blood stream directly or are taken in the mother's diet. 
Chemical agents that lead to malformation in the fetus are called teratogens. Teratogens act selectively on 
certain organs. The effect depends on the timing of the exposure, how much of the chemical is taken by 
the mother (dose) and the sensitivity of each developing organ to the chemical (Larsson, 1973; Michaelis 
and Michaelis, 1994). Exposure to alcohol during the embryonic stage lead to malformations of the head 
and face (Michaelis and Michaelis, 1994). These are the most common abnormalities seen in FAS. The 
effects of exposure in the fetal stage include growth retardation and neurological defects (Scialli, 1992; 
Coles, 1994).<P>
<H2>Incidence</H2>
The formal diagnosis of FAS and FAE is difficult; only a small proportion of affected mothers and babies 
are accounted for in official statistics.(1)  For example, in 1992/93 only 18 pregnant women across Canada 
were diagnosed as damaging the fetus because of their drinking. In addition, 74 babies were treated in 
hospital because of "noxious influences transmitted by the placenta or breast milk". <P>
More is known about the effects of drugs on mothers and their unborn babies. In 1992/93, 250 pregnant 
women were treated for drug dependence. One-third of these women were between age 20 and 24 and one 
half were between 25 and 34. Only 10 cases of suspected damage to the fetus and 72 cases of drug 
withdrawal syndrome in the new-born were reported. <P>
There are no national data on the rate of occurrence of FAS and FAE in Canada (Ashley, 1994). 
Conservative estimates are that 0.33 cases of FAS occur in every 1,000 births in western countries (Abel 
and Sokol, 1991). This estimate means that approximately 100 children are born in Canada each year 
with FAS (Ashley, 1994) and approximately 1,200 cases occur in the United States (Abel and Sokol, 
1991). In some remote, rural communities and some Aboriginal communities, the incidence of FAS is 
much higher than for Canada as a whole (Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, 1992). The 
incidence of FAE is about three times higher than the full FAS (House of Commons, 1991).<P>
Although few studies exist, the incidence of FAS in some Aboriginal communities is much higher than in 
other parts of Canada (Scott, 1994). Despite the methodological weaknesses of these studies, Robinson et 
al. (1987) found a rate of 190 FAS/FAE cases in 1,000 children. Two thirds of the affected children were 
mentally retarded. Wong estimated that FAS occurred in 4.7/1,000 births of Native children, compared 
with 0.25/1,000 births in the general population, including Natives (Abel and Sokol, 1991). Asante and 
Nelms-Matzke found an FAS/FAE rate of 25/1,000 children (age 0 to 16) among Native groups in 
Northwestern British Columbia (Métis and Indian) and 46/1,000 among those in the Yukon, as compared 
with 0.4/1,000 for other groups in both regions (Asante and Nelms-Matzke, 1985). <P>
American studies show Native FAS incidence ranging from 1.4/1,000 to 9.8/1,000 (McTimoney et al., 
1989; Scott, 1994). High FAS rates (5.1/1,000) have been reported in Alaskan Native populations as well 
(Christensen, 1990). The differences in incidence may be due to alcohol abuse in women of child-bearing 
years, variations in how alcohol is metabolized, drinking patterns or dietary deficiencies in communities 
(Asante, 1981).<P>
Several characteristics have been identified in communities that indicate a high or low risk of alcohol 
problems, including FAS and FAE. For example, some Native communities have much higher rates of 
FAS and FAE than others because of the predominant drinking norms (Ashley, 1994; May, et al., 1987). 
FAS and FAE rates should change over time in these communities, fluctuating with the level and pattern 
of drinking. Tribal affiliation is another factor that influences drinking norms in ways similar to other 
cultures. Drinking norms vary greatly by community and by subgroups. Communities that are less socially 
integrated, where drinking habits differ in each subgroup, have higher levels of FAS/FAE among their 
children (Ashley, 1994).<P>
<H2>Methodological Issues</H2>
Findings on fetal alcohol syndrome are far from conclusive. The methodological problems of these studies 
may distort estimates of FAS incidence. For example, in catchment area studies, FAS is diagnosed during 
the neonatal period, when characteristics like the facial features, central nervous system involvement and 
mental retardation are difficult to identify and do not emerge until children are older. Retrospective 
studies over-sample groups in which FAS is expected to occur more often. FAS may be overestimated if 
the health data come from organizations that charge for the information (i.e., insurance companies). 
Prospective studies may underestimate the incidence of FAS because women who are at greatest risk for 
FAS babies do not receive prenatal care. <P>
There are other, more basic weaknesses in FAS studies, particularly for high-risk populations. Studies of 
minority groups may be severely biased (Abel and Sokol, 1991). For example, two of the most common 
facial features associated with FASthe short eyefolds and the flat philtrum -- occur normally among 
Aboriginals and blacks. The potential cultural bias in these studies brings into question the findings of 
studies that found inordinately high incidence of FAS in these populations. Inaccurate diagnoses of FAS 
can lead to <I>overestimating</I> the effects of small amounts of alcohol taken during pregnancy, 
creating unnecessary panic in no-risk groups.<P>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>
Children who meet the criteria for FAS are born only to mothers who drink large amounts of alcohol 
during pregnancy. Other risk factors are not well understood, e.g. women who drink heavily during 
pregnancy are often poor, undernourished, depressed and abused. These problems are present among 
heavy drinking populations generally. <P>
The reasons for drinking during pregnancy are based not only on personal beliefs, but also on a complex 
mix of socio-environmental factors and other reinforcing factors. These factors include the drinking 
patterns of friends or family and the situations that lead to heavy drinking.<P>
<HR>
(1)  Little and associates (1990) found a 100 percent failure rate to diagnose FAS at birth in a large teaching hospital.<HR>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
It would be foolhardy for the reader to digest this information without some qualification of its limitations and some 
recommendations for its improvement. Furthermore, while this is meant to be an exclusively Canadian profile, this 
distinction is not useful for researchers or Indigenous groups because the similarity of circumstance north and south of 
the border warrants attention to American data. With respect to Canada, a sizeable portion of Indigenous peoples, 
namely the Métis, are excluded from most databases. Also, unless otherwise specified, this information <I>cannot</I> 
be generalized to the off-reserve (including the urban) context, where we know the majority of Canadian Indigenous 
peoples live.<P>
While some argue that the health of Indigenous peoples is similar whether they reside in the city or rural settlements, 
others suggest that those who live in the city may be slightly better off than their rural counterparts.(1) But the debate 
has never been settled conclusively. <P>
The social indicators from which Indigenous substance abuse and its consequences are inferred is collected primarily 
by the federal government (i.e. Medical Services Branch, Health Canada), whose collection methods vary considerably 
among regions, and from provincial systems. This makes national normative data unavailable. Where survey research 
is available, the construct validity and reliability of the instruments used is rarely discussed. In addition, the response 
burden of the litany of surveys and questionnaires in recent years has tainted most data with apathy or majority non-
participation. <P>
The differences between western and Indigenous sciences, together with other cultural barriers, complicate 
communications, data collection and interpretation. Scattered groups are extremely heterogeneous in community 
structure and, even within communities, many people recognized as "Indian" are of various racial and ethnic origins. 
Urban Indigenous populations are either not identified or do not participate in Canadian polls such as the National 
Alcohol and Drug Survey. <P>
Still, from crude and indirect assessment, some patterns are clear. The following profile attempts to supplement 
previous CCSA and federal works (to which we refer the reader for further information), although some information is 
replicated. It will highlight what is known about abuse in the Indigenous community and, to the extent possible, 
illustrate differences between Indians on- and off-reserve, Métis and Inuit communities. <P>
<H2>Determining prevalence</H2>
Generally, substance use is inferred from social indicators analysis and by most indicators, it is clear that the 
Indigenous community is at a relatively greater risk for abuse-related physical consequences than their general 
counterparts.(2) Traditional formulae that extrapolate the prevalence of alcoholism from liver cirrhosis rates are not 
appropriate for the Indigenous population because the life span is not long enough. Similarly, the marginalization of 
Indigenous groups has made them difficult to capture in Canadian databases and no studies have examined alcohol-
related diagnoses and discharge rates for Canadian Indigenous groups. Therefore, the most indicative records are 
violent death rates, which bear strong statistical correlations with substance abuse.(3,4)<P>
Medical Services Branch (MSB), responsible for Indian and Inuit health services, reports that the leading causes of 
death for their service population, in hierarchical order, were injury and poisoning (including suicides) and circulatory 
system diseases, with the exception of the Atlantic and Ontario regions, where death due to circulatory system diseases 
was more prevalent than death due to injury and poisoning. These are fairly stable patterns in the mortality data for 
this group.(2,3)<P>
Indigenous patterns of violent death show a clear and consistently elevated risk. In some cases, the rate is three and 
four times greater than national norms, with young people accounting for much of the variation between groups. When 
broken down by region and sex, it is clear that rates of violent death escalate with westward and northern movement, 
and that males account for much of the elevated risk of violent mortality.(6)<P>
Suicide has always featured prominently as an indicator of social distress and is a subset of the violent death category, 
which also has strong statistical associations with addiction.(4) While some studies have found that violent death rates 
increase from south to north,(7,8) suicide patterns in British Columbia differ somewhat, with interior groups being at 
greatest risk.(9) In fact, Cooper et al (1992) found that suicide rates for those off-reserve (16/100,000) closely 
paralleled that of British Columbians generally, whereas those on-reserve had a dramatically elevated risk 
(37/100,000). Another important finding is the apparent structural difference between on-reserve communities with 
high suicide rates and those with low suicide rates: <P>
<I>"On average, people living in areas with high suicide rates had lower levels of education; lived in households 
with larger numbers of occupants; had more children living at home; included more single parents and fewer elders, 
and had lower incomes, generated by a smaller proportion of the population" (ref. 9, page 21)</I><P>
The same comparison was attempted with non-Indigenous areas with high and low suicide rates, but this yielded more 
similarities than differences: the authors conclude that non-Indigenous suicide rates are "apparently not predictable on 
the basis of the characteristics examined" (ref. 9, page 21).<P>
Unlike death rates from injury and poisoning, which seem to escalate from east to west and south to north, suicide 
rates from Medical Services Branch (Indian and Inuit groups) indicate that men seem at greatest risk in Atlantic, 
Alberta, Pacific and Yukon regions, while women seem at greatest risk in Pacific, Alberta and Ontario regions. <P>
Although suicide has received much attention as an indicator of social distress, accidental death rates are sometimes 
twice the suicide rate.(10) In a five-year trend analysis of unnatural death rates in Alberta, Indigenous risk was four to 
five times the general rate.(10) Such a pattern of dramatically escalated risk has also been documented in 
Saskatchewan and British Columbia.(7,11) Interestingly, the Saskatchewan study noted that northern groups fared far 
worse than the less isolated regions. <P>
<H3>Gender differences</H3>
When we infer substance abuse from social indicators analysis, there are some apparent differences between the sexes. 
With respect to death due to injury and poisoning, there is a wide and fairly stable discrepancy between the sexes in 
Indian and Inuit groups, with men being much more likely than women to die violently.(2,3) These data suggest a 
couple of things about gender differences in addiction. The first conclusion we might draw is that women do not suffer 
from addiction to the same extent that men do. It is clear, after all, that they do not die as frequently from violent or 
accidental means. The second conclusion we could draw is that they may be suffering to the same extent but they 
suffer quite differently. In other words, the physical consequences of their addictions is not fatal as frequently as it is 
for their male counterparts. This conclusion is supported by the fact that usually the sexes of Indigenous groups are 
more similar to each other than they are to Canadians generally when we look at opportunities for social reinforcement 
of substance use and adolescent use patterns.(12,13,14) Examination of gender-specific abuse-related diagnoses and 
discharge rates might shed a conservative light on which conclusion is valid.(15)<P>
When we look strictly at within-group gender differences, there is some evidence to suggest, at least in Maritime 
provinces, that Indigenous men are more likely to abuse alcohol, while Indigenous women tend to abuse drugs 
alone.(16) The Yukon Alcohol and Drug Survey suggested that Indigenous women were more likely to have 
irregular/infrequent drinking patterns than their male counterparts, and men were almost three times more likely than 
women to declare themselves heavy/frequent drinkers.<P>
With respect to tobacco use, only slight gender difference were noted in Smoking Among Aboriginal People in Canada 
(1991), including older women being more likely to have never smoked daily (women 27%, men 18%) and women 
65+ being less likely to be current smokers (women 28%, men 38%). When broken down by age and gender, there 
were slight differences in consumption patterns in the 45+ age group. Women in the 45 to 64 age category were more 
likely to be light consumers (1 to 10 cigarettes daily, women 30%, men 17%), whereas men in the same age category 
were more likely to be heavy smokers (26+ cigarettes/day, men 13%, women 6%).(18)<P>
Examination of gender-specific issues in addiction would be incomplete without some profile of FAS (Fetal Alcohol 
Syndrome) prevalence. Much controversy surrounds the estimation of FAS incidence and prevalence in Indigenous 
communities. Bray and Anderson (1989) claim that failure to control for higher fertility rates and increased span of 
childbearing years account for much of the inflated rates currently published.(19) Burd and Moffat (1994) believe that 
some of this inflation can be accounted for by screening procedures and diagnostic criteria, neither of which is always 
detailed in the literature. Methodologically, they recommend that investigators:<P>
<UL>
<LI>a) be blind to maternal alcohol ingestion
<LI>b) select communities where rates may be low
<LI>c) engage in longitudinal cohort studies
<LI>d) review death certificates whenever possible.(20)
</UL>
By most published accounts, rates of FAS incidence are indeed higher than average among Indigenous Canadians, 
although much fluctuation occurs in American data. Conservative estimates of FAS/FAE (Fetal Alcohol Effect) 
incidence in general samples yielded 1 to 3 per 1,000.(21) American studies show an Indian FAS incidence ranging 
from 1.4 to 9.8 per 1,000.(22) A Canadian study discovered an FAS/FAE rate of 25 per 1,000 children (0 to 16 years) 
among Indigenous northwestern BC populations (Métis and Indian) and a rate of 46 per 1,000 among Yukon 
Indigenous groups. The rate for general Canadian populations in both regions was 0.4 per 1,000.(23)<P>
While there is argument that the epidemiological methods of these Canadian studies are questionable, Indian women 
recognize "that the full potential of Indian people may be jeopardized as the result of a race of people weakened by 
fetal alcohol syndrome".(24) Therefore, while exact prevalence cannot be nailed down which isolates how many 
Indigenous women might be considered alcoholic or how many might give birth to a child with FAS or FAE, we can 
infer that substance abuse results in severe and debilitating consequences at rates above North American females 
generally in some regions.<P>
<H3>Children</H3>
Beyond what effects children may endure as a result of FAS/FAE, rarely do addiction profiles take into account the 
special substance use patterns of children (those under age 12 years). While much attention has been focused on 
adolescent substance use, the only literature that describes the use patterns of children focuses on substance-specific 
use (e.g. smokeless tobacco and solvents). Still, one of the most disquieting epidemiological facts about addiction in 
the Indigenous community is the alarming rate of substance use in this age group. Although children are most likely to 
abuse tobacco (including smokeless products), alcohol, cannabis and solvents, age at use onset has been shown to be 
substantially younger than general North American children for a variety of substances (25,26,27,28,29.30) and 
children are entering Canadian Indigenous treatment facilities at younger ages,(31,32,33) primarily in central and 
western provinces. Fiddler (1985) discovered a suicide rate of Saskatchewan Indian children (0 to 14 years) 
<I>phenomenally</I> higher than their national or provincial counterparts (27.5 times greater than Canadian 
children generally and 33.6 times greater than children in Saskatchewan generally).(7) In the most recent profile of 
addictions patterns of Indigenous peoples in urban centres, 67% of participating Friendship Centres reported that 
children were consuming alcohol and sniffing solvents during school hours, after school, on the streets and in their 
homes, sometimes with their families.(34)<P>
<H3>Alcohol use</H3>
Apart from self-report survey data, the Post Censal Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS) and those collected at Indigenous 
treatment centres, very little exists that directly describes alcohol use in Indigenous communities. The Northwest 
Territories (NWT) Health Promotion Survey provides some information about Inuit and Dene who have been grouped 
together for these analyses.(12) Responses to questions about alcohol consumption revealed a clearly greater 
polarization in drinking patterns among this northern Indigenous group; i.e. there were more abstainers and more 
heavy drinkers. <P>
In the Yukon Alcohol and Drug Survey, in which respondents were broken down by ethnicity and drinker category, 
the following patterns resulted.(17) Congruent with the NWT Health Promotion Survey data, a greater polarization in 
drinking patterns of Indigenous groups is noted, and is maintained when broken down by sex. However, when drinker 
categories were broken down by ethnicity and age, it became clear that groups over age 20 account for the greater 
polarization in drinking patterns. Canadian adolescents in general were slightly more polarized in drinking patterns 
than their Indigenous counterparts in the Yukon sample. <P>
When examining adolescent alcohol use patterns in greater detail, some regional variations were noted. In a Manitoba 
sample, it appears that Indian and Métis adolescents off-reserve are similar to their non-Indigenous counterparts, 
whereas greater differences were noted between general Canadian samples when compared with Indian adolescents 
on-reserve in Quebec. These differences may be explained by the fact that the Indigenous group of comparison differs 
by residence, or the fact that the general Canadian group of comparison is geographically similar to the Indigenous 
group in the Manitoba sample.<P>
The most recent survey of alcohol consumption patterns among Indigenous peoples is reported in the Language, 
Health and Social Issues subset of the Aboriginal Peoples Survey, 1991. Fortunately, these data allow us to compare 
between Indigenous groups, namely Indians on- and off-reserve, Inuit and Métis. Recall the clearly greater 
polarization in drinking patterns of previous data sets, where abstention and heavy drinking were greater in 
Indigenous groups than in general Canadian populations. When we look at abstention by Aboriginal identity, the Inuit 
have a significantly higher abstinence rate than either Indian or Métis groups.<P>
This may suggest that the greater polarization pattern is more evident in the North. These patterns by Indigenous 
grouping lend greater evidence to the notion that there is something significant about community. When questioned 
about whether or not they perceived alcohol abuse as a problem in their community, Indian groups on- and off-reserve 
were more likely to perceive alcohol abuse as a problem in their community than either Métis or Inuit groups. Inuit, on 
the other hand, were most likely to believe that alcohol abuse is not a problem..(35)<P>
<H3>Drug use</H3>
Much of the direct assessment of drug use patterns is done with Indigenous adolescents. The adult data  available from 
the NWT Health Promotion Survey reveals that 30% of Indigenous men and 16% of Indigenous women (Inuit and 
Dene) claimed to have used cannabis in the last year. The Treatment Activity Reporting System (TARS) shows that 
narcotics are consistently the second most popular drug in the adult institutionalized group.(31,32,33) The most recent 
Canadian data available about drug use among Indigenous adolescents (limited to Indian and Métis residents off-
reserve) were gathered in a Manitoba non-metropolitan city.(36)  Interestingly, the rate of marijuana use is three times 
greater for Indigenous adolescents. Rates of use were also consistently and significantly higher in the Indigenous 
group for non-medical tranquillizers, LSD and other hallucinogens. Higher rates of use were also noted for crack, 
cocaine, PCP, stimulants, speed, heroin and barbiturates in the Indigenous group. These differ somewhat from a 
comparison of Indian adolescents on-reserve and general Canadian adolescents in that rates of depressant, 
hallucinogen and stimulant use were lower in the Indian group across all age levels, while rates of cocaine and solvent 
use were higher in the lower grades in the general Canadian sample. However, consistently higher rates of cannabis 
use were noted in the Quebec Indian sample across all grade levels.(13)<P>
<H3>Tobacco use</H3>
From the NWT Health Promotion Survey, it is clear that the overwhelming majority of Indigenous (Inuit and Dene) 
men and women currently smoke cigarettes (women 72%, men 71%), and many claimed to smoke regularly (women 
57%, men 59%).(12) A national survey of Indian and Inuit women revealed that 78% of Inuit women smoke before 
pregnancy, 76% during pregnancy and 75% in the first month postpartum. Fifty-four per cent of Indian women 
smoked during pregnancy and just under half (49%) smoked before and after pregnancy.(37)<P>
The most recent and comprehensive information on the smoking patterns of Indigenous Canadians is based on data 
collected in the Aboriginal Peoples Survey, which has been analyzed and compiled in Smoking Among Aboriginal 
People in Canada, 1991.(34) From this report, we know that the majority (57%) of those age 15+ currently smoke. 
Daily smokers (46%) are almost twice as prevalent as in the general Canadian population (26%). Like alcohol 
patterns, smoking is highest among those ages 20 to 44. The vast majority (65%) of 20 to 24-year-olds currently 
smoke and more than half (53%) claim to be daily smokers. While very few differences were noted between the sexes, 
smoking did decrease with increased education and income. Regional variations were also apparent.(38)<P>
In addition to the wide variability in the percentage of current smokers (includes daily and occasional) by region, there 
seem to be different smoking patterns between regions. Aboriginal peoples from the Maritime provinces have the 
highest daily consumption rate, while those residing in Saskatchewan, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories 
have relatively low daily consumption rates. Therefore, while northern groups may have the greatest number of current 
smokers, they are likely to smoke less on a daily basis than those in other regions. <P>
Regardless of age, the Inuit were much more likely to be current smokers than either Indian or Métis groups. Few 
gender differences were noted within Aboriginal groups, but Métis consumption patterns on a daily basis were much 
higher than for Indians or Inuit. <P>
<H3>Solvent use</H3>
In a recent national consultation with Indigenous youth and service providers representing Indian, Métis and Inuit 
groups, the following profile of the solvent abuser emerged:<P>
<UL>
<LI>a) Age at use onset is roughly nine to 10, but some start sniffing as early as age five; age at use onset seems to be 
steadily decreasing.
<LI>b) Boys are more likely than girls to abuse but more girls are abusing now than ever before.
<LI>c) Solvent-abusing youth come from dysfunctional families with a history of addiction.
<LI>d) Abusers are often from isolated communities, suffer poorer grades or drop out of school.
<LI>e) Unemployment, illiteracy, poor housing and history of physical/emotional/sexual abuse are associated with 
their sniffing..(39)
</UL>
Most children (49.3%) in a First Nations and Inuit community youth solvent survey began sniffing when they were age 
4 to 11. Compared with the overall average, a much higher percentage of children began to use solvents at this age in 
Alberta (79.4%), Saskatchewan (64.8%) and the Yukon (81.3%). The familial and social factors related to their 
sniffing included alcohol and drug abuse in the home (67.2%), family conflict (65.3%), unemployment (51.7%), 
malnutrition or neglect (43.5%), financial hardship in the home (42.3%) and physical abuse (31.3%).(40)<P>
In a recent multi-year Manitoba survey of Indian and Métis adolescents, glue sniffing was higher in the Indian/Métis 
group with the exception of 1992 data; however, solvent use was consistently higher in the Indian/Métis group for all 
years.(36) <P>
<H2>Indigenous treatment centre activity</H2>
The Treatment Activity Reporting System (TARS) yields the most recent, systematic data on the institutionalized 
chemically dependent person. In hierarchical order, national TARS data reveal that alcohol and narcotics are 
consistently the most widely abused substances, with alcohol at least twice as likely to be the abused substance of 
choice.(31,32,33) In recent TARS data sets, there is an increasing trend of narcotics and prescription drug abuse; 
however, this trend must be viewed with caution as there has been confusion about where cannabis has been classified. 
Based on the national client profile, roughly 45% of people seeking treatment are female, up from previous TARS data 
where roughly 41% were female.<P>
Consistently, the bulk of treatment participants is found in the 25 to 34 age category, with a slightly greater proportion 
of men in the older age categories. Interestingly, there has been a slight narrowing of the discrepancy between the 
sexes in treatment participation in older age groups over time. Previous TARS data reveal a pattern where males 
greatly outnumber females.(31,32) This may reflect several important gender-specific trends. One theory is that 
treatment centres are now becoming female-friendly institutions or that the attitudinal barriers to seeking treatment 
have been removed or reduced for women. The second theory is, of course, that more women than ever before need 
treatment. When broken down by region, it also becomes obvious that with a westward movement, the discrepancy 
between the sexes in treatment participation narrows.(33)<P>
The stark exception in this TARS data set is the difference between the sexes in Alberta, a pattern not obvious in 
previous data sets. <P>
<H2>Addressing the problem</H2>
Just for a moment let's move away from identifying the problem and look at the factors that seem to offer protection. 
Communities with clear proscriptive norms about alcohol and drug abuse fare better than those without them.(40)  The 
O'Chiese guidelines for community sobriety(41) strongly recommend addiction-free community leadership as a good 
first start. It is obvious that some Indigenous leaders recognize this modeling role and are even participating in 
treatment as a group.(42) Recreation, be it sports or hobbies, offers protection from an abusing lifestyle.(13,43) Strong 
cultures, families and the value of spirituality have all been shown to be associated with drug free life.(13,43,44) And 
lastly, the opportunity to participate in meaningful work reduces the risk of addiction.(44)<P>
Several targets have been identified in the primary prevention of abuse-related problems, including the person, 
community and specific substances.(45) Families must be included in future prevention frameworks because they are 
recognized as an important and integral part of treatment intervention,(46) and as the single best predictor of success 
in continuing recovery.(47) Consistently, what seem to work best are treatment interventions that emphasize 
strengthening from the inside out (where communities direct the healing process and tap into internal and external 
resources as necessary) and the essential balance between physical, mental, emotional and spiritual 
elements.(48,49)<P>
<H2>Recommendations for future research</H2>
Although this chapter replicates some information previously published in Indigenous addiction profiles,(50,51) it is 
an attempt to shed <I>new</I> light and review more recent literature, comparing it, where appropriate, to historical 
trends. Despite the limitations of the data presented here and in previous reviews, more detailed epidemiological 
scrutiny is hard to justify (except perhaps for the Métis, where little health information exists). Without argument, 
there is a socially and physically devastating addictions problem in some Indigenous communities. The important and 
operative questions remain, "which ones and why?" For national program and policy development purposes, some 
fundamentals are clear. Indigenous children are at great risk not only for substance abuse but alsomost alarmingly 
for its violent consequences. Tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and solvents are the most commonly abused substances, and 
substance abuse is greatest where people suffer from poverty, isolation, low self-image, weak family structure and 
dysfunctional dynamics, as well as personal histories of physical, sexual and emotional abuse.(52,53)<P>
Addiction in a community context shows some curious patterns unlike those found in general Canadian populations. 
Consistently, there is a greater polarization of alcohol consumption between individuals within communities where the 
same structural conditions exist. Certainly worth pursuing as part of our endeavour to solve the problem is to figure 
out why individuals who endure fundamentally the same conditions do not succumb to the addictions. <P>
Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, there are also extreme differences in addiction patterns between regions and 
communities and possibly between various Indigenous groupings. In those communities where there is widespread 
addiction, there is evidence to suggest that community characteristics,(52) socioeconomic and lifestyle factors(54) 
contribute substantially to substance use and its consequences. More specifically, future research should 
illuminate:<P>
<OL>
<LI>What are the structural differences between communities that are relatively free of addiction problems and those 
that are devastated by them?
<LI>What are the differences in substance use patterns between Indigenous and Canadian groups when socio-
economic factors are controlled?
<LI>What are the familial and psychological differences between heavy drinkers and abstainers in the same milieu? 
<LI>What are the correlates of non-use among Indian, Inuit and Métis groups and how can these be promoted in the 
context of familial and community development? 
</OL>
Future research efforts would be <I>infinitely</I> more practical if they were solution-oriented, by initiating creative 
action to arrest the problem with rigorous evaluation, and then modifying this action to be portable. In any case, 
addictions research must bear maximum relevance to the situation of Indian, Inuit and Métis groups, and this can only 
be achieved in partnership with them, where they are in control, centering and developing the research endeavour to 
suit their circumstance. Success stories certainly do exist wherever self-help groups have evolved, but their progress 
and development is largely unknown outside local environments. As part of future research efforts, these stories need 
to be told.<P>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>
Indigenous children are at substantially greater risk for substance use and its violent consequences than Canadian 
children generally. Proportionately more adults participated in treatment in the western provinces, with the bulk being 
age 25 to 34. Indian and Inuit groups are at greater risk of abuse-related mortality, especially in the 15 to 35 age 
group, when compared with their North American counterparts. And, although the Indigenous woman's risk of abuse-
related death is substantially lower than her male counterpart's, much data suggest that she is more like him than 
other females in substance use patterns. <P>
There is a greater polarization in alcohol consumption patterns among individuals within communities and significant 
variation among communities. Social support norms seem related consistently to use across sex and age groups. But 
for much of the research cited here the artifacts of acculturation and socio-economic status have not been controlled. 
We know that culture, family and distribution of wealth play a significant role in healing and protection from 
addiction, but resolving the dilemma requires particular attention and sensitivity to group needs of Métis, Inuit and 
Indianswhat makes them resilient and, most importantly, what are the structural changes which are necessary 
concomitants to the community quest to heal?<P>

<TITLE>Canadian Profile 1996: Law regarding alcohol, drugs and tobacco in 
Canada</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><H3>Canadian Profile 1996</H3>
<H1>The Law Regarding Alcohol, Drugs 
and Tobacco in Canada</H1>
<I><H4>by Robert Solomon, Professor of Law, University of 
Western Ontario</H4>
</I><HR>
<H2>Federal alcohol regulations</H2>
The federal government has authority over the importing and exporting of alcohol products, alcohol-
related excise taxes and broadcast advertising. The broadcasting regulations prohibit a range of messages, 
including any that attempt to influence non-drinkers to drink; appeal to minors; associate  consumption 
with high-risk activities; suggest consumption is associated with social acceptance, personal success, or 
athletic or business achievement; or violate the relevant provincial advertising law.<P>
<H2>Provincial alcohol regulations</H2>
The control and sale of alcohol is also regulated by legislation in each province. The 10 provinces and two 
territories all have, to varying degrees, monopolies that control the sale of alcohol for off-premises 
consumption. The legislation governs the sale of alcohol in on-premises establishments, pricing, the 
minimum drinking age and the transport of alcohol. It also prohibits public consumption, intoxication and 
the sale of alcohol to intoxicated persons.<P>
Provincial governments also have control over alcohol marketing and advertising. Typically, the 
provincial legislation prohibits certain marketing practices, such as price discounting, drinking contests, 
giving alcohol as prizes and free drinks. Most of the provincial advertising regulations prohibit lifestyle 
advertising, advertising that appeals to minors, advertising that depicts or encourages immoderate 
consumption, and advertising that associates alcohol with driving or other potentially dangerous 
activities.<P>
The legal drinking age is 19 in all Canadian provinces and territories, except in Quebec, Manitoba, and 
Alberta, where the minimum age is 18. However, drinking below these age limits is permitted in licensed 
establishments in New Brunswick and, under certain circumstances, in residences in P.E.I., Alberta, 
British Columbia, Ontario and Saskatchewan.<P>
<H2>Federal drinking and driving law</H2>
There are four specific drinking and driving offences in the federal <I>Criminal Code:</I> operating or 
having care or control of a motor vehicle while one's ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or a drug; 
impaired driving causing death or bodily harm; operating or having care or control of a motor vehicle 
with a blood alcohol level (BAL) over .08%; and failing to provide a breath or blood sample for analysis. 
These four offences are punishable by imprisonment, heavy fines and lengthy driving prohibitions. <P>
The scope of these offences is broad. First, there is no geographical limit on where the offences may be 
committed. For example, motorists have been convicted when apprehended on a private driveway or 
parking lot. Second, the offences apply to any "motor vehicle", which is broadly defined to include 
motorcycles, mopeds, snowmobiles, golf carts, and even lawn tractors. Third, these offences apply not 
only to those who are actually driving, but also those who merely have "care or control" of a motor 
vehicle. The phrase "care or control" encompasses virtually any act that could set a vehicle in motion, 
even accidentally. Motorists have been held to have had care or control when they used their vehicle as a 
place to sleep, were warming up the engine or were trying to extract their car from a ditch with a jack.<P>
(i)<B> Impaired operation of a motor vehicle</B>: The Criminal Code makes it an offence to operate a 
motor vehicle if one's ability to do so is impaired by alcohol or a drug. The courts have defined the term 
"drug" to include any legal or illegal substance that can cause impairment, including, for example, model 
airplane glue. They key issue is whether the accused's ability to drive was impaired, not whether he or she 
was driving in a careless or dangerous manner. Similarly, the amount of alcohol or drugs consumed is 
irrelevant. The courts have also adopted a broad definition of the term "impaired", which focuses on 
whether the driver had complete control of the vehicle.<P>
(ii) <B>Impaired operation of a motor vehicle causing death, and impaired operation of a motor 
vehicle causing bodily harm: </B>These two new offences were introduced in 1985 to ensure that 
impaired drivers who caused serious accidents would be subject to a more onerous charge than impaired 
driving. <P>
(iii) <B>Operating a motor vehicle with a BAL over .08%</B>: It is a criminal offence to operate a 
motor vehicle with a BAL over .08%. The fact that the car was being driven safely makes no difference. 
Nor does it matter whether the driver appeared to be sober or whether his or her ability to drive was in fact 
impaired.<P>
The amount of alcohol that someone must consume to have a BAL in excess of .08% varies from person to 
person, depending on such factors as weight, percentage of body fat, how quickly the alcohol was 
consumed, and when the person last ate. An individual's BAL can be determined by analysing samples of 
his or her urine, blood or breath. Although the police have the power to demand blood samples in limited 
circumstances, most cases involve the chemical analysis of breath samples. <P>
The <I>Criminal Code</I> authorizes the police to use two different kinds of machines for analysing 
breath samples, namely "approved screening devices" (i.e., ALERTS) and "approved instruments" (i.e., 
Breathalyzers). If the police have complied with the <I>Criminal Code'</I>s testing procedures, the 
Breathalyzer results are deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be proof of the driver's 
BAL. <P>
(iv) <B>Refusal to provide a breath or blood sample</B>: It is a criminal offence to refuse an officer's 
demand for a breath or blood sample without a reasonable excuse. The essential element of this offence is 
the failure to comply with the officer's demand. Provided the officer had the requisite grounds for making 
the demand, it is irrelevant that the accused was driving safely, was otherwise innocent of any 
wrongdoing, or had not consumed any alcohol.<P>
The police can demand breath samples in two situations. First, an officer may demand a breath sample for 
an ALERT test from any driver that the officer reasonably suspects has any alcohol in his or her body. 
This is not a difficult test to meet. The manner of driving, the odour of alcohol on a driver's breath, 
slurred speech, clumsiness, bloodshot eyes, or inappropriate responses to questions could all create a 
reasonable suspicion that the driver has consumed alcohol. The police need not believe that the driver is 
drunk, impaired or committing any offence. <P>
Second, the police may demand breath samples for analysis in a Breathalyzer machine from any driver 
they have reasonable and probable grounds to believe has committed, within the last two hours, one of the 
other impaired driving offences.<P>
A drinking and driving incident may also involve various other federal offences, including failing to 
remain at the scene of an accident or dangerous driving. In 1985, Parliament created the offence of 
operating a motor vehicle while prohibited from driving, or while subject to a provincial licence 
suspension for a federal drinking and driving offence. This offence was introduced to address the problem 
of impaired driving offenders who continued to drive without a licence.<P>
<H2>Provincial laws relating to drinking and 
driving</H2>
The provincial highway traffic legislation is important in the apprehension, prosecution and punishment 
of drinking drivers. First, the provincial legislation generally gives the police the power to stop vehicles, 
determine if the driver has been drinking, and check the driver's licence, insurance and ownership.  By 
observing and talking to the driver during this initial contact, an officer can determine whether there is 
sufficient evidence to demand an ALERT test. Second, several provinces have created provincial licence 
suspensions for drivers who refuse to provide a blood or breath sample, or who have a BAL of .05% or 
more. Finally, most of the provinces impose lengthy licence suspensions on federal impaired driving 
offenders. For example, any driver convicted of a federal drinking and driving offence in Ontario is 
subject to a mandatory 12-month licence suspension.<P>
<H2>Federal drug law</H2>
The two most important federal statutes dealing with illicit drugs are the <I>Narcotic Control Act 
</I>(NCA) and the <I>Food and Drugs Act</I> (FDA). The <I>Narcotic Control Act c</I>overs 
cocaine, cannabis, heroin, phencyclidine, opium, and other opiates. It does not distinguish in any material 
way between these drugs. For example, cannabis and heroin offenders are subject to the same procedures, 
penalty provisions and criminal record consequences.<P>
There are six common offences under the <I>Narcotic Control Act</I>possession, trafficking, 
possession for the purpose of trafficking, cultivation of opium or cannabis, importing or exporting, and 
"prescription shopping". (This last offence involves obtaining a narcotic from one doctor without 
disclosing that a prescription for a narcotic had been obtained from another doctor within the past 30 
days.)<P>
Unless authorized by statute, possession of any amount of a narcotic is an offence. No specific quantity is 
required for a charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking. Rather, a large quantity of drugs or other 
evidence of an intent to traffic, such as scales, baggies, and lists of names, may serve as the basis for 
laying a charge. The offence of trafficking is broadly defined to include giving, sharing, administering, 
transporting or sending a narcotic.<P>
In Canada, offences are divided into two broad categories; namely, those tried by summary conviction and 
those tried by indictment. There are also hybrid offencesoffences in which the prosecutor may proceed by 
summary conviction or by indictment. Possession and prescription shopping are hybrid offences under the 
<I>Narcotic Control Act</I>. If the Crown chooses to proceed summarily, the offender is liable to a 
maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine for the first offence, and 12 months' 
imprisonment and a $2,000 fine for subsequent offences. If the Crown proceeds by indictment, the 
maximum penalty for possession is seven years' imprisonment. All other <I>Narcotic Control Act 
</I>offences are tried by indictment. The maximum penalty for cultivation is seven years' imprisonment, 
while trafficking, possession for the purpose of trafficking, importing, and exporting all carry a maximum 
penalty of life imprisonment.<P>
Under the <I>Narcotic Control Act,</I> importing, and exporting carried a mandatory minimum 
sentence of seven years' imprisonment, regardless of the amount involved or other circumstances of the 
case. However, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down this mandatory minimum sentence, because it 
violated section 12 of the <I>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,</I> which prohibits cruel and 
unusual punishment.  The court stated that this minimum might be appropriate for large-scale smuggling, 
heroin and other so-called "hard" drugs, and repeat offenders. However, the minimum was too broad 
because it applied regardless of the drug, the offender's prior criminal record or the quantity of drugs 
involved.<P>
<I>The Food and Drugs Act</I> focuses on controls over pharmaceuticals, foods, cosmetics, and medical 
devices. There are two parts, however, which concern non-medical drug use. <P>
Part III governs "controlled drugs", including amphetamines, barbiturates, and other stimulants and 
depressants. Offences for trafficking, and possession for the purposes of trafficking carry a maximum 
penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. The offence for prescription shopping carries a maximum of three 
years' imprisonment and a $5,000 fine. There is no possession offence.<P>
Part IV governs "restricted drugs", including LSD, psilocybin and DMT. Trafficking and possession for 
the purpose of trafficking in "restricted drugs" carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. There is a 
possession offence for "restricted drugs", which is subject to a maximum penalty of three years' 
imprisonment and a $5,000 fine.<P>
The <I>Narcotic Control Act</I> and <I>Food and Drugs Act </I>have been amended to include two 
relatively new offences: knowingly possessing property or other proceeds of any common drug offence 
(except the offence of possession); and knowingly dealing in such property or proceeds with the intent to 
conceal or convert them. This latter offence is commonly referred to as "money laundering".<P>
In addition to these two drug statutes, other federal laws pertain to illicit drugs. Amendments to the 
Criminal Code make it illegal to knowingly import, export, manufacture, promote or sell illicit drug 
paraphernalia or literature.  A court has recently struck down these provisions as they relate to drug 
literature. The judge held that these offences constitute an unjustifiable violation of freedom of speech as 
guaranteed by section 2 (b) of the <I>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</I>.<P>
<H2>Federal tobacco legislation</H2>
Parliament enacted the first federal criminal prohibition against tobacco in 1908. This largely-ignored 
legislation was repealed in 1994 with the enactment of the <I>Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act</I>. 
This Act makes it an offence for those who, in the course of a business, sell, give or furnish cigarettes to a 
person who is under 18. Offenders are subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 for a first offence, $2,000 
for a second offence and $10,000 for a third offence. The Act also prohibits the placing of cigarette 
vending machines in any public place, other than bars and taverns. Those who sell tobacco products are 
required to post signs indicating that sales to those under 18 are prohibited.<P>
Parliament has also enacted statues that regulate tobacco marketing and restrict smoking in certain places. 
The <I>Tobacco Products Control Act</I> severely limits tobacco company sponsorship, and the 
advertising and promotion of tobacco products. It also requires  tobacco packaging to carry large, 
prominent, health warnings. In September, 1995, following a court challenge of the legislation, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down sections of the Act prohibiting advertising of tobacco products.<P>
The <I>Non-smokers Health Act </I>prohibits or severely restricts smoking on aircraft, trains and ships, 
and in Crown corporations, federal offices, banks, and other organizations under federal control. In most 
cases, the Act limits smoking to designated smoking rooms or areas. A violation of the Act constitutes a 
summary conviction offence that is punishable by a maximum fine of $1,000 for a first offence and 
$10,000 for a subsequent offence.<P>
<H2>Provincial tobacco legislation</H2>
Manitoba and Ontario have enacted provincial workplace smoking legislation. The Ontario legislation 
prohibits smoking in most enclosed workplaces. The legislation allows, but does not require, an employer 
to establish designated smoking areas. Employers are required to post signs and make "every reasonable 
effort" to enforce the legislation on their premises.<P>
All Canadian jurisdictions except Alberta, Quebec and the Yukon prohibit sales of tobacco products to 
young people. The specifics of the legislation vary, with Ontario and Nova Scotia having perhaps the most 
comprehensive and stringent provisions.<P>
Finally, the number of municipalities that have enacted smoking by-laws has increased rapidly since the 
mid-1980s. The scope of the prohibitions has increased, enforcement efforts have been stepped up and the 
penalty provisions have become more rigorous. The by-laws typically restrict or prohibit smoking in 
municipal offices, workplaces, restaurants, shopping malls, schools, hospitals, public transport facilities 
and other public places. Proprietors are often required to post signs and, in some cases, make reasonable 
efforts to enforce the law.<P>

<TITLE>Canadian Profile 1996: Street Youth</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><H3>Canadian Profile 1996</H3>
<H1>Street Youth</H1>
<I><H4>by Diane McKenzie, Canadian Centre on Substance 
Abuse</H4>
</I><HR>
<H3>Highlights</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Although illicit drug use is high for street youth, there is evidence of decline.
<LI>Between 1990 and 1992, a smaller proportion of Toronto street youth report using cannabis, LSD, 
cocaine, tranquilizers, speed, heroin and "ice".
<LI>Drugs are used by street youth to cope with the effects of a violent home life and the day-to-day 
hardship of living on the street. Drug use is also part of street life because drugs are easy to obtain.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>Overview</H2>
Street kids are heavy users of illicit drugs. Street youth, often referred to as "runaways" or "throwaways", 
are defined by two factorstheir age and their absence from home without a parent's permission for 24 
hours or more (Radford et al., 1989). <P>
"Throwaway" youths are those who have been overtly rejected by their parents (Radford et al., 1989). 
There are no reliable estimates of the size of the street youth population in Canada because of the 
transitory nature of these young people. The size and composition of the group is constantly changing 
(Zdanowicz et al, 1993); as many as 150,000 street youths move through Canadian cities every year 
(Covenant House, 1988). <P>
Several studies indicate that Canadian adolescents turn to the street to escape situations of physical, 
emotional and sexual abuse or neglect in the home (Radford et al., 1989; Smart et al., 1992; Anderson, 
1992). The lifestyles of street youth involve many high-risk behaviours (Radford et al., 1989; Smart et al., 
1992; Anderson, 1992). HIV infection is a particularly serious risk because of drug use and needle 
sharing, unsafe sex practices, lack of resources and opportunity to maintain proper hygiene.<P>
<H2>Patterns of drug use</H2>
Studies show that street youth in each city have different patterns of drug use. Radford et al.'s (1989) 
national study indicated that two-thirds of all street youth used drugs and/or alcohol weekly or daily. Only 
a small proportion abstained from all substances. The most popular substances are alcohol, cannabis, LSD 
and cocaine (Radford et al., 1989; Smart et al., 1990; 1992; Anderson, 1992). Although use of illicit drugs 
is very high in this population, there is evidence that overall use is declining.<P>
<B>Alcohol: </B>Although the majority of street youth across Canada use alcohol, research indicates 
that a substantial proportion does not. In 1989, about 88% of Radford et al.'s national sample of street 
youth drank alcohol, but 12% abstained; 9% reported drinking daily. In 1992, about the same proportion 
of Halifax street youth said they used alcohol in the past year, but a much lower proportion used alcohol 
daily (5%). The proportion of youth who use alcohol is higher in Toronto, with about 95% using alcohol 
in the past year, and 6% using every day.<P>
<B>Cannabis:</B> In 1989, the national study of street youth indicated that 71% of those interviewed 
used cannabis in the past year and 24% used it almost daily (Radford et al., 1989). In 1992, about two-
thirds of Halifax street youth (66%) used cannabis in the past year; 27% of those who used cannabis, used 
daily (Anderson et al., 1992). Toronto street youth reported more cannabis use than other cities, with 83% 
using in the past year (Smart et al., 1992). The proportion of daily users (15%) of cannabis remained 
stable between 1990 and 1992 in the Toronto sample.<P>
<B>Cocaine and Crack:</B> In 1989, about 31% of Canada's street youth used cocaine in the past year 
and 4% used it on a daily basis. In 1992, 18% of Halifax street youth used cocaine, with 4% using it daily. 
One in eight reported using crack, with 4% doing so daily. In Toronto, 31% used cocaine in the past year, 
and 3% used it daily. Thirty-one per cent used crack in the past year and 5% used crack daily. <P>
<B>LSD and other hallucinogens: </B>In 1989, 44% of Canadian street youth used LSD in the past 
year and 4% used it daily. Fifty-nine percent of the Toronto group used LSD in the past year. The 
proportion who used LSD daily was 1%.<B> "</B>Ice" and "Ecstasy" are other drugs currently being 
used on the street in Toronto, Halifax and other major centres across the country. The majority of street 
youth use inhalants, including industrial purpose glue, paint thinner and other solvents because they are 
inexpensive and easily attainable.<P>
On average, the most frequently used drugs are cannabis (92 times in the past year), crack (68 times) and 
cocaine (49 times) (Smart et al., 1992).<P>
The age of initiation into drug use differs according to the nature of the drug. On average, street youth 
began using cannabis at 13 years old and LSD at 15 years old. Most other drugs were first used at 16 years 
old, except for crack and heroin, where first use occurs at 18. <P>
<B>Injection Drug Use:</B> Injection drug use and the practice of sharing needles place street youth at 
great risk of HIV infection. In 1989, 12% of the national sample of street youth admitted injecting drugs 
such as Talwin and Ritalin, speed, cocaine and heroin and almost half of those shared needles (Radford et 
al., 1989). In Toronto, 28% injected drugs at some point in their lifetime and 4% shared needles during 
the past year (Smart et al., 1992). <P>
<B>Declining Drug Use: </B>There is evidence of declining levels of drug use among street youth in the 
Toronto studies conducted by the Addiction Research Foundation (Smart et al., 1992). Between 1990 and 
1992, fewer street youth used cannabis (from 92% to 83%),<B> </B>LSD (from 70% to 59%), cocaine 
(from 64% to 31%), tranquillizers (59% to 29%), speed (from 24% to 9%), heroin (from 13% to 4%) and 
"Ice" (from 5% to 1%). Overall, the number of drugs used at the same time also declined between 1990 
and 1992 in this group. There was a decrease in the proportion of individuals using five or more drugs 
(from 38% to 22%) and an increase in the number that only used one or two drugs (from 15% to 
36%).<P>
<H2>Substance-related problems</H2>
The 1992 Toronto study (Smart et. al., 1992) examined the drug-related problems of street youth. About 
half of those surveyed said they had flashbacks or blackouts, one-quarter found they were not able to stop 
using drugs when they wanted to stop. About 40% were concerned about their drug use and 35% said they 
wanted to use drugs less often. More street youth were arrested for drug-related offences (from 26% to 
34%), medical problems (from 19% to 22%), seeking help (from 21% to 30%) and receiving medical 
attention (13% to 21%) in 1992 than in 1990 (Smart et al., 1992).<P>
The Toronto sample reported being more heavily involved in illegal activities than for Halifax (Smart et 
al., 1992; Anderson, 1992). About 27% of the Toronto group and 15% of the Halifax group participated in 
break-and-enter offences (Table 6.5). About 43% of Toronto street youth compared with 16% of the 
Halifax sample sold drugs; 23% and 14% participated in robbery or robbery with violence respectively. 
About 10% of the Toronto and Halifax samples were prostitutes. The Toronto group reported substantial 
involvement of alcohol or drugs in their illegal activities: 28% in break and enter, 65% in prostitution, 
48% in selling drugs and 51% in robbery with violence. <P><B>
</B>Street youth use drugs to cope with the effects of a violent home life and the day-to-day hardship of 
living on the street. Drugs are also part of street life because they are easy to get. Drug use helps them 
cope or escape their situation, particularly if they turn to prostitution or pushing drugs for their 
livelihood.<P>

<H2>Say more than a simple "thank you"</H2></CENTER><BR CLEAR=left>
<HR>
In every community in Canada, there are groups and individuals working to reduce the harm 
associated with alcohol and other drugs. The CCSA Medallion of Distinction was established in 
partnership with all 12 provinces and territories to honour the finest achievements of these 
dedicated volunteers and professionals. The CCSA Medallion of Distinction gives all Canadians 
a chance to recognize people who deserve more than a simple "thank you".<P>
<H3>Do you know someone in the substance abuse field 
who deserves recognition?</H3>
Following a series of countrywide consultations that began in 1990, the Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse developed an awards program to recognize Canadian achievements in the 
substance abuse field. Winners of the CCSA Medallion of Distinction are chosen by <A HREF 
= "#committee">provincial and territorial selection committees</A> and receive their award 
during Drug Awareness Week in November. Anyone can nominate a candidate for the award; 
you don't have to reside in the same province or territory as the nominee.<P>
<H3>Who is eligible?</H3>
You may nominate any Canadian citizen or landed immigrant working in the following substance 
abuse-related areas:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Prevention/education/information
<LI>Treatment

<LI>What role has the candidate played in improving conditions for poor, marginalized, and/or high-risk 
populations?
<LI>How successful has the candidate been in fostering partnerships among various sectors (education, 
labour, justice, etc.)?
</UL>
<P>
<B>Winners of the CCSA Medallion of Distinction automatically become candidates 
for the <A HREF="/ccsaward.htm">CCSA Award of Distinction,</A> presented in Ottawa during Drug Awareness 
Week.</B><P>
<H5>Both awards are made to either an organization or an individual on a 
rotating basis from year to year. In 1995, the two awards will be presented to 
an organization, and in 1996, to an individual.</H5>
<P>
<H3>To Nominate Someone for the Award</H3>

The impact healthy communities can have on drug and alcohol use, and the need to involve youth are 
predominant themes for Drug Awareness Week (DAW) and National Addictions Awareness Week 
(NAAW) 1995.<P><BR CLEAR=left>
<H2>Northwest Territories</H2>
National Addictions Awareness Week (NAAW) will be celebrated in the territory with sober walks, 
alcohol-free dances, radio talk shows and "Join the circle" rallies. Organizers are also holding a territory-
wide contest to find a mascott for the week.<P>

The focus for NAAW is youth, and the slogan is "Live in the Light". The week will be launched on 
Monday, Nov. 20, with an opening circle in the lobby of the legislative assembly, in Whitehorse. 
Throughout the week, mall displays and a draw for a NAAW sweatshirt are planned, the local role model 
program will be the subject of presentations at three communities in the territory, and a substance-free 
celebration dinner will be held Wednesday, Nov. 22, at Kwanlin Dun Village.<P>
The highlight of NAAW is a youth conference, to be held Friday Nov. 24, in Whitehorse. The local school 
of dance is opening the conference, and a theatre group has been added to present the play "You can't get 
away from you". The featured guest is motivation speaker Bill Gordon (the "Bionic Turkey") who will talk 
about self-esteem and making healthy choices.<P>

<H2>British Columbia</H2>
The community is the focus for Drug Awareness Week (DAW), and the slogan is "You make a 
difference". Organizers want to encourage communities to celebrate activities that promote healthy 
choices and reduce the misuse of alcohol and other drugs.<P>
The week will be proclaimed by the Minister of Health, and all mayors and municipal councils will be 
invited to proclaim the week in their jurisdictions.<P>
A number of corporations are promoting DAW, including McDonald's, Island Farms, 7-Eleven stores, 
Canada Safeway, Shoppers Drug Mart and Overwaitea Foods. These corporations are using BC's logo and 
slogan in their advertising and packaging material. The BC Liquor Distribution Branch is also printing

The new slogan for NAAW 1995 in Alberta is "Going somewhere ... it's your choice", and the theme for 
the week is healthy choices, healthy directions. The Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission 
(AADAC) is targeting the general public, and has developed artwork for a "month-at-a-glance" calendar 
for schools and community groups. The Commission is also working with the Office for the Prevention of 
Family Violence, and will distribute pocket-sized telephone directories to students, along with two 
brochures explaining the link between family violence and substance abuse.<P>
The AADAC office in Calgary, Health Canada and private sponsors are releasing a video during NAAW 
called "Ten feet tall and bullet proof". The video was made by a group of youth called Generation 
Warriors, after the death of a street kid. The office is also planning free family skating and open houses. 
In Edmonton, AADAC is doing a mail campaign, and is sending custom information packages to social 
service offices and workplaces.<P>

community working together to be drug free".<P>
The Elks/Royal Purple will have a float in the annual Grey Cup Parade, Saturday, Nov. 18, and will 
display a drug awareness banner.<P>
The provincial kickoff is scheduled for Monday, Nov. 20, in LaRonge, and local organizers have planned 
events throughout the day. The CCSA Medallion of Distinction will be presented to SADD (Students 
Against Drinking and Driving) Saskatchewan on Wednesday, Nov. 22, in Prince Albert, at the 
community's annual DAW breakfast. After the presentation, DAW organizers will send the medallion "on 
tour" to all SADD chapters in the province. All nominees for the Medallion of Distinction will receive a 
plaque recognizing their drug awareness efforts.<P>

healthy lifestyles and alternatives to addictions. Information kits have been sent to 1,000 schools and 500 
communities.<P>

<H2>Ontario</H2>
The Ontario Drug Awareness Partnership (ODAP) is a 16-agency coalition that does drug awareness 
programming throughout the year in the province. The partnership is focusing on communities ("Caring 
communities find a way"), and is using the "Believe in yourself. Be drug free" logo.<P>
Pizza store chains are being encouraged to put stickers with the slogan on their delivery boxes, and Esso 
gas stations and public libraries have been given polybags imprinted with the logo and scenes of different 
community action strategies to use. Oversized buttons with the logo have been distributed to community 
groups, and organizers hope the groups will distribute the buttons to crossing guards to wear during 
DAW.<P>
The Addiction Research Foundation (ARF) is sponsoring a free teleconference on Tuesday, Nov. 21, 
between 1:00-3:00 pm, titled "Building resilience in families to prevent alcohol and drug use in youth". 
<P>
ODAP has an award program, and for 1995 it invited nominations from community groups. The awards 
will be presented during DAW, and the testimonials which were part of the nomination form will be used 
by the partnership to produce a community action booklet.<P>

Improving communications between adults and youth is the focus for DAW. Two slogans have been 
developed: "You are important, in their eyes" targets parents, and "Your parents once were your age" is 
aimed at youth.<P>
A two-sided pamphlet has been published, with questions on one side for parents to answer and the other 
for youth. The pamphlet asks both groups to rate the quality of their communications, and it has been 
distributed to every pharmacy in the province with the help of the College of Pharmacists. A 20-page 
booklet on the same theme has been developed for addictions workers, giving ideas on how they can 
structure their information to help improve communications.<P>
Two posters have also been developed, one focusing on adults and the other on youth. They have been 
distributed in schools.<P>

"Working together for healthy communities" is the slogan for DAW. The Community Star Awards, given 
in the seven health regions to individuals who are good role models and have healthy lifestyles, will be 
presented Monday, Nov. 20. Across the province, treatment facilities will sponsor open houses, schools 
will have poster contests and radio stations have planned talk shows to promote drug awareness. Local 
and community newspapers have also been encouraged to run articles or do special inserts to promote 
drug awareness information.<P>
Organizers are launching an awareness calendar during DAW. The calendar is bilingual, and each month 
highlights a different topic; for example, January, 1996 promotes National Non-Smoking Week, April 
features gambling and July, boating safety.<P>

"Celebrating and protecting youth" is the slogan for the Island. An interagency group is targeting 
underage drinking and drug use. Organizers have planned public presentations, mall displays and a 
special insert in the Saturday edition of The Guardian (the newspapers that "covers the Island like the 
dew"). The insert will highlight the extent of underage drinking, and give tips to parents. Also, CBC radio 
will air a program with youth, parents and mem-bers of SADD; an impaired driving pro-gram will also be 
launched during DAW.<P>

<H2>Nova Scotia</H2>
"Together we make the difference" is the slogan for DAW, and the focal point of the campaign is 
communities. Flag raising ceremonies will be held in many communities across the five regions of the 
province, as will parades and mall displays. The slogan and Nova Scotia's logo will be very visible during 
the week, appearing on roadside banners, T-shirts and on promotional items (zipper pulls, key chains and 
fridge magnets) that have been distributed.<P>

Families and communities together is the theme for DAW, and the slogan "FACT is . . ." is an acronym 
formed by the theme.<P>
Organizers are working with the media to arrange a province-wide trivia contest on radio stations. There 
is a daily contest, running for five days, with winners receiving DAW environmental mugs each day. At 
the end of the week, a single name will be drawn from among the daily winners for the grand prize, a 
DAW sweatshirt. With NTV/CTV, organizers have produced a drug awareness television commercial,

Nechi's mascott, Sober Bear, is retiring, so the Institute is sponsoring a "Name that bear" contest for its 
new mascott, Sober Bear's cub. Children in grades one to six, attending schools on reserves can enter the 
contest, and the winner and an accompanying adult will receive a trip to Edmonton with accommodation

<TITLE>CCSA Award of Distinction 1995 Winners</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<IMG SRC="/daw95e.gif" WIDTH=511 HEIGHT=217 ALT="Cleaning up the hood"><P>
<H2>Nominated by former Toronto Mayor June 
Rowlands, Alexandra Park Residents 
Association wins the <BR>
1995 CCSA Award of Distinction </H2>
Communities can be a powerful force when neighbours unite against a common enemy. In the case of 
Toronto's Alexandra Park Residents Association (APRA), the enemy was drug-related crime and 
violence. In four years, APRA has turned a downtown subsidized housing community from a centre for 
drug trafficking into a vibrant community where residents of all ages are proud to be involved with 
community life. The following account (edited slightly for length), along with a letter signed by former 
Toronto Mayor June Rowlands, accompanied  the nomination form submitted by the Mayor's Task Force 
on Drugs:<P>
"In 1990 (Alexandra Park) residents became fed up with the conditions in the neighbourhood and began a 
series of initiatives towards renewal. The association executive was changed. Under the leadership of 
president Sonny Atkinson, APRA sought assistance from local politicians, the police, the schools, 
Metropolitan Toronto Housing Authority (MTHA), City Departments and other local agencies.<P>
"They worked together with MTHA and City of Toronto officials to take down walls and shrubs that hid 
drug dealers, and to improve lighting. They worked with the police and MTHA to get rid of tenants who 
were operating crack houses and to patrol frequently to discourage gangs of drug traffickers. They worked 
together with the City and MTHA to sponsor a youth program. Youth who had previously been denied 
access to local recreational facilities were given training and opportunities to plan and monitor their own 
recreational activities. They became an integrated part of community life whereas previously they had 
been outcasts. They had priority for space in the local community centre. They ran their own recreation 
programs in the local school. They even became members of the board of APRA.<P>
"It has taken some time, but the changes in the community have been significant. The residents now seem 
friendly and relaxed. The gangs of drug traffickers have been dispersed and crack houses are few. The 
residents are currently negotiating with MTHA to have their units turned into cooperative housing. By 
using all of the available resources, together with their own diligent work, they have rebuilt Alexandra 
Park into a supportive community that cares for its youth and provides them with an alternative to drugs 
and alcohol."<P>
<H1>CCSA Medallion of Distinction<BR>
WINNERS<BR>
1995</H1>
The CCSA awards program now distinguishes between groups and individuals. This year it was the turn 
of organizational candidates; in 1996 individuals will be recognized.<P>
<H2>Drinking &amp  driving groups dominate 
awards</H2>
<H3>Teen organizations take top honours in three 
provinces</H3>
The tragic impact that drinking and driving continues to have on communities across Canada is reflected 
in the variety of organizations that have emerged to address the problem. Groups such as MADD, SADD, 
and TADD may differ in several respects, but they all share a common goal: to reduce or eliminate the 
needless injury and loss of life inflicted on society by impaired drivers.<P>
<H4>Newfoundland: Happy Valley-Goose Bay (Labrador) 
Chapter of MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving)</H4>
The Happy Valley-Goose Bay (Labrador) Chapter of MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) became 
active in 1991 after a young girl was killed by an impaired driver. MADD's efforts to change impaired 
driving laws in Newfoundland and Labrador have led to 24-hour licence suspensions for BACs (blood 
alcohol content) of .05 per cent or greater, impaired driving education for first-time offenders, and 
assessment of two-time offenders.<P>
MADD has involved the community in a wide variety of activities, including the province's first Red 
Ribbon Campaign (launched by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien when he was still opposition leader), a 
Christmas poster contest, a candlelight vigil in memory of victims of impaired driving, and an annual 
motorcade during Drug Awareness Week. The group also developed a "grieving package" for the families 
of impaired driving victims.<P>
<H4>Prince Edward Island: Colonel Gray High School and 
Charlottetown Rural High School Chapters of SADD (Students 
Against Drinking and Driving)</H4>
Prince Edward Island had a joint winner this year: two SADD (Students Against Drinking and Driving) 
chapters from <I>Colonel Gray High School</I> and Charlottetown Rural High School. Active since the 
1980s, the groups run numerous school projects throughout the academic year, beginning with the annual 
fall presentation of Motivational Media, an hour-long production using giant screens (11 ft by 13 ft) to 
deliver a message about positive lifestyles. Both chapters raise funds to pay for the show which focuses on 
substance abuse.<P>
In the community, the SADD groups work with the RCMP doing information road checks, organize a 
yearly McDonald's Run for SADD, devise Christmas anti-drinking-and-driving radio messages, and 
operate a Red Ribbon campaign. This campaign combines awareness-building and fund-raising for special 
activities such as attending provincial SADD conferences. Last December, the two groups gained prime-
time TV coverage when they tied red ribbons to telephone poles between the two schools.<P>
<H4>Manitoba: Minnedosa Collegiate Teens Against Drinking 
and Driving (TADD)</H4>
The Minnedosa Collegiate Teens Against Drinking and Driving (TADD) is such a popular group that 
more than 12 per cent of the students attending this small Manitoba collegiate belong to it. TADD's busy 
calendar of school and community activities includes hosting numerous events during Drug and Alcohol 
Awareness Week (DAW) in November. A mock trial and arrest for impaired driving, an annual pancake 
breakfast, and a wrecked car exhibit on Main Street are among their DAW projects.<P>
TADD is also active in province-wide conferences and events such as the Day of the Dead. Students dress 
in black to represent the approximately 50 Manitobans who die each year in alcohol-related crashes. They 
participate in school activities, but as "dead" people, they don't talk or interact with other students or 
teachers. On a lighter note, the TADD group produced and distributed 1,700 brochures last Christmas 
containing recipes for non-alcoholic punches.<P>
<H4>Saskatchewan: Students Against Drinking and Driving 
(SADD)</H4>
SADD (Saskatchewan) is a formidable group with 2,300 members and 182 registered chapters. Since 
1985-86, more than 15,000 young people have been members. Starting in 1990, SADD used its influence 
to lobby for changes to Saskatchewan's impaired driving legislation, and recently succeeded in gaining 
political recognition of its two key principles: that youth should not be singled out for specific measures 
that are not applied to adults; and that impairment begins with the first drink.<P>
SADD was nominated jointly by officials of the Saskatchewan Department of Highways, Saskatchewan 
Government Insurance, Kiwanis Clubs, RCMP, Saskatchewan Safety Council, and the Royal Bank. The 
nomination speaks of the "personal courage,   positive action and attitude" of SADD members. It makes 
the point that young people who choose to abstain or who intervene to prevent drinking and driving often 
face negative peer pressure.<P>
<H2>Education &amp  prevention... from sea to 
sea to sea</H2>
Medallion winners from Nova Scotia, British Columbia and Yukon--three of the four corners of the 
country--were chosen primarily for promoting awareness of alcohol and drug-related problems and 
devising prevention strategies.<P>
<H4>Nova Scotia: Yarmouth Committee on Drug Awareness and 
Prevention</H4>
The origins of the Yarmouth Committee on Drug Awareness and Prevention go back to the late 1970s 
when its volunteer members waged a successful campaign to bring substance abuse treatment services and 
facilities to this Nova Scotia community. Turning its attention to community education, it formed 
partnerships with the province's Drug Dependency Services and a host of other volunteer and professional 
organizations, including local Home and School Associations, the Acadia band (a Native addictions 
counsellor sits on the committee), the RCMP, and the Department of Health.<P>
In recent years, the committee has organized and hosted a seven-part cable TV series on addictions, 
developed an FAS/FAE educational resource package under the community support program of Canada's 
Drug Strategy (CDS), supported KADD (Kids Against Drugs and Drinking) groups in three schools, and 
formed a youth drop-in centre steering committee to work toward fulfilling the need for such a 
facility.<P>
<H4>British Columbia: Thompson/Okanagan Alcohol and Drug 
Abuse Prevention Teams (T/O ADAPT)</H4>
Thompson/Okanagan Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Teams (T/O ADAPT) medallion winners from 
British Columbia, have promoted prevention in various ways since 1986. Last year, T/O ADAPT received 
two CDS grants which allowed the group to provide training in risk and resource assessment to a number 
of small communities over a period of 18 months, and to begin setting up a computer network to link drug 
and alcohol and prevention teams.<P>
Under the CDS Community-Based Prevention Response program, T/O ADAPT sponsored successful 
training sessions for various target groups, including parents, task force members and front-line youth 
workers. The society also took an active part in DAW activities last November, donating "You Make a 
Difference" T-shirts to 14 communities in the region.<P>
<H4>Yukon: Beaver Creek R.C.M.P.</H4>
Yukon's medallion winner is the Beaver Creek RCMP, who were nominated by the Beaver Creek Nursing 
Station. The nomination singles out Corporal Larry Kavanagh and Constable Ralph Cardinal for their 
commitment to addressing addiction-related and health concerns in their community. They provide drug 
education in the local school using resources provided by the RCMP Drug Awareness Program 
representative in Whitehorse. Kavanagh and Cardinal also work closely with the White River First Nation 
in Beaver Creek, helping older adults to use medications effectively and advocating for a wilderness 
treatment centre for alcoholics.<P>
 The two officers also volunteer with sports and leisure activities in the community in the belief that an 
active lifestyle reduces feelings of boredom and can prevent youth from becoming harmfully involved with 
alcohol and other drugs.<P>
<H2>Treatment &amp  rehabilitation... helping 
high-risk groups</H2>
Organizations offering treatment programs for chemically dependent teenagers and women were selected 
as medallion winners in Québec and Alberta.<P>
<H4>Québec: Les Centres Jean Lapointe pour 
Adolescent(e)s</H4>
Les Centres Jean Lapointe pour Adolescent(e)s (the Jean Lapointe Centres for Teenagers) have been 
operating in Québec City since 1989 and Montreal since 1992. Entertainer Jean Lapointe, who agreed to 
lend his name to Maison Jean Lapointe in 1982 after his own recovery from alcoholism, is a household 
name in Québec. His annual telethons to raise funds for drug and alcohol treatment have made a huge 
media impact and have greatly enhanced awareness of addictions in the province.<P>
Since 1989, more than 1,300 young people have benefited from the services the two centres offer, 
including assessment, referral, lodging and follow-up. An unusual feature of the program is the 
availability of schooling at the centres to allow clients to maintain their academic skills during their eight-
week residential therapy.<P>
<H4>Alberta: Riverside Villa Association</H4>
The Riverside Villa Association (RVA) is a non-profit funded agency which provides a broad spectrum of 
addictions services to chemically dependent women 18 years and older. RVA opened its first 28-day 
treatment facility in 1973 and added another facility in 1980 to provide a safe residential environment for 
women learning to adjust to long-term sobriety.<P>
In 1993, with budgets being cut and demands for services increasing, it was decided that a major 
restructuring was needed. After some initial opposition from within the organization, the agency has 
succeeded in closing one residential facility while amalgamating all residential clients into the other, 
developing and implementing a completely new treatment program, doubling the size of the counselling 
staff, providing many new staff training opportunities, and acquiring a new non-residential treatment 
facility.<P>
<H1>Judging    the CCSA Award of 
Distinction</H1>
Every year a five-member panel of judges is chosen by lot to pick the winner of the CCSA Award of 
Distinction. The panel is composed of two CCSA board members and three representatives of the 
addictions community. All five panelists must be from different provinces or territories, and judges cannot 
vote for a candidate from their own jurisdiction.<P>
The judges begin their work in June after nominations are received and processed, and meet by video 
conference in September to select the winner. The conference is chaired by CCSA liaison staff members 
Gary Roberts and Gilles Strasbourg.<P>
This year's judges were Brian Wilbur, Drug Dependency, Policy and Planning Division, Nova Scotia 
Department of Health; Karen Ferrucio, Addiction Research Foundation, Central South Regional Office; 
Leila Campbell, Programs Branch, Saskatchewan Health; and CCSA board members Maggie Hodgson 
and Jennifer Power.<P>

<H2>2,000 requests a year... and growing</H2>
CCSA offers two information services through its National Clearinghouse on Substance Abuse: the 
General Reference Service, and (since May 1994) the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Fetal Alcohol Effects 
(FAS/FAE) Information Service, a toll-free resource funded by CCSA, the Brewers Association of 
Canada, the Association of Canadian Distillers, and Health Canada.  A single question can require up to 
several days of computer-assisted searching, information processing and custom packaging, but 40 per 
cent of requests received in 1994/95 were turned around within 24 hours.<P>

<H2>Resources expand, thanks to networking</H2>
Information networks are an essential tool for expanding knowledge within the substance abuse field.  
They give more people access to existing information resources, and can be used to generate new data in 
areas where we need to know more.  Special interest networks are particularly useful for increasing our 
understanding of specific issues or populations.<P>
<P>
<H3>Canadian Substance Abuse Information Network 
(CSAIN)</H3>
CCSA's National Clearinghouse on Substance Abuse had fewer than 1,000 items in its collection when it 
opened in 1991.  By the following year, this database, known as CCSADOCS, had tripled in size.  The 
launch of CSAIN that year added a new database called CANBASE with document records from every 
major substance abuse library in Canada.  From 1994 to 1995, the two databases expanded by 12 per cent, 
with much of the growth coming from CANBASE through CSAIN members.<P>

<H2>Directories &amp  research reports</H2>
Directories are a basic information tool in any field.  CCSA maintains two large directory databases with 
information on more than 3,000 substance abuse organizations, people and programs. These are published 
as print products every two years.  Research and statistical reports are another essential information 
resource. CCSA produces an annual statistical profile in collaboration with the Addiction Research 
Foundation of Ontario (<I>Canadian Profile</I>) and has worked jointly with Health Canada to publish 
research on special populations (<I>Horizons</I> series). In 1994/95, CCSA distributed nearly 1,000

<H2>Information outreach: adding impact</H2>
In 1994/95, CCSA staff took advantage of many opportunities to reach new audiences by publishing in a 
variety of professional journals, presenting papers at gatherings around the world, teaching, and granting 
dozens of media interviews.  Measuring the impact of information on a specialized audience - substance 
abuse professionals, for example - is a difficult task, although the size and type of group can suggest at 
least part of the story.  In the case of mass media coverage, the job of measurement takes on mammoth 
proportions.  No attempt has been made here to calculate how many newspaper readers and television 
watchers may have been exposed to CCSA information. The numbers are potentially large.<P>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Consultation &amp  policy advice</FONT></H3>
<UL>

<H2><A NAME="ccsn">CCSN ONLINE</H2>
The Canadian Children's Safety Network (CCSN) evolved from discussions at a national childhood injury conference in 1991. An informal network had existed for some time, but a desire to provide a means for increased communication and collaboration emerged, as well as a need to move the problem of injury to a more prominent place on the social and political agenda.<P>
In 1994, the SMARTRISK Foundation, formerly the Canadian Injury Prevention Foundation, was selected to establish the process that would become both a network of people and a structural network for information exchange. The vision was not of a new organization, rather a means for communication among people and groups, brought together by their desire to reduce the potential for injury, guided by the principals of inclusion and leadership through partnership.<P>
<B>The Network:</B>  The Meeting Place is a general discussion area of conference, where new ideas and threads of interest are introduced. Specific discussion takes place in conferences under titles such as home, sports, road, advocacy, etc. You can search conferences for information on specific topics such as research, abstracts, publications, funding sources as well as entries from the Directory of Child/Youth Injury Prevention Programs.<P>

<H2>It's Time to Know:  Ten Marijuana Users Share Their Personal Stories</H2>
In this book, author/therapist Joanne Baum reveals the damage marijuana can do to people's lives. One person after another recounts how marijuana grew into an overpowering and negative force in their lives. "It is certainly clear from these people's stories that pot is not a harmless drug to be used with no consequences," says Baum in the final chapter. "Marijuana users can lose years from their lives and experience long-lasting mental and emotional pain." <P>

Partial author's abstract: The trials support the use of brief interventions by physicians for 
patients with drinking problems. Although further studies are needed to determine their 
effect on morbidity and mortality, the public health impact of such interventions is 
potentially enormous. Further research in needed to determine which patients are best 
suited for brief interventions, the optimal intensity of treatment and which components of 
brief interventions are most effective. Research is also needed to establish which strategies 
are effective in inducing physicians to use brief interventions.<P>

Partial author's abstract: A two-year prevention program was administered to 121 boys 
and girls 11 through 12 years of age. Problem and no-problem children were randomly 
assigned to a prevention program or to a no-treatment group.  Treatment consisted of a 
modified version of the Life Skills Training Program.  Children who were in the 
prevention program developed more negative attitudes towards cigarettes and marijuana 
from pre-test to post-test as compared to control subjects. However, no significant 
differences between prevention and control children were obtained for use of cigarettes, 
alcohol and marijuana. Some links between proximal and sital variables were significant, 
albeit weak. Discussion addressed the limits of a child-centred prevention program, 
especially with regard to at-risk children<P>

<H3>Preface</H3>

<P>
This guide to alcohol and other drug information sources is intended
for health science library and information centres in research,
clinical or community settings.
<P>
We have included a variety of resources, including reference books,
reports, statistical publications, periodicals, electronic sources,
publishers, and contact organizations.
<P>
The resource lists are selective and are intended as a guide to
some of the resources we use most often. While they would be of
interest to a variety of health professionals, more emphasis is
given to clinical and treatment resources. Canadian items are
selected whenever possible.
<P>
The primary source consulted was the ARF library catalogue. All
of the items listed are in the Addiction Research Foundation Library
collection. Selected reading lists and information resources on
alcohol and other drugs from the U.S. were also consulted.
<P>
The guide is arranged by the type of resource. Descriptive annotations
are included for some items, but this does not imply a recommendation.
Recommended items for health science libraries are marked with
an asterisk (*). The ARF Library LC call number is also provided.
<P>
We hope the guide will provide an overview of the field and a
quick reference guide. We welcome your comments.<HR>

<H2>How this booklet was written</H2>
This booklet was written by women for women as a prevention resource.  We hope women can 
use it to <B>prevent</B> alcohol and other drug problems when they are pregnant.  It is 
<B>not</B> intended as a treatment resource, although women with alcohol and drug 
problems might find it helpful.  We have tried to make it easy to read.<P>
Many women helped write this booklet.  Some of us have had drug and alcohol problems.  
Some are counsellors who have worked in prevention and treatment agencies.  Others are 
social workers, community health nurses, and pharmacists.<P>

Alcohol, Other Drugs, and Pregnant Women's Lives</H2>
<H3><A NAME = whois></A>Who is this booklet 
for?</H3>
This booklet is for women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant.  It has information about 
effects of alcohol and other drugs on pregnancy and breast-feeding.  Some women find it's easy 
to cut down or quit when pregnant.  Other women find it's difficult.  If so, you are not alone.  
Many women are in this situation.<P>
We talk about the effects of different drugs on you and your baby.  We look at the way other 
people affect you and your health.  We give you ideas to try instead of using alcohol or other 
drugs.  And we show you where to get support if you need it.<P>
<H3><A NAME = purpose></A>What is the purpose of 
this booklet?</H3>
This booklet was written to:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>give pregnant women facts.</B>  Many women want to know the facts before 
they decide to make changes in their lives.  But it's hard to find facts everyone agrees with about 
using alcohol and other drugs during pregnancy.  There are many different opinions.  So the 
facts we give you are those that everyone agrees with.  But we also try to show how pregnancy 
is affected by the amount of stress in your life.
<B><LI>reassure pregnant women.</B>  Many pregnant women are made to feel scared 
or guilty if they drink or take drugs.  Very small amounts during pregnancy probably won't harm 
you or your baby.  But nobody knows for sure.  So if you do use alcohol or other drugs, get 
helpful information.  We hope this booklet offers ideas to help you avoid problems.
<B><LI>give pregnant women realistic information.</B>  An ideal pregnancy includes 
healthy food, affordable housing, a supportive partner, and a stress free life without alcohol or 
other  drugs.  But your reality can be very different.  This booklet contains information that is 
realistic.  And we hope it offers choices that are practical.
<B><LI>support pregnant women who have stressful lives.</B>  Many things, not just 
alcohol and other drugs, affect the health of you and your baby.  You might not have enough 
money to meet all your needs (such as food, housing, transportation, and child care). Maybe 
your partner mistreats you.  This booklet gives ideas for dealing with all kinds of problems, 
including alcohol and other drugs.
<B><LI>reassure women that pregnancy is a shared responsibility.</B>  In the past, 
pregnant women were made to feel totally responsible for the health of their babies.  But more 
and more, people realize that everyone involved plays a role.  This can include your partner, 
family, friends, and community.  So we have included information in this booklet for everyone.
<B><LI>help pregnant women find support.</B>  There are many reasons why women 
might need support, especially during pregnancy.  This booklet will give you ideas about where 
to get help, if you need it.
</UL>
<H3><A NAME = whygive></A>Why Give and 
Take?</H3>
The name <B>Give and Take</B> came from a pregnant woman.  She said the easiest thing 
to remember is "if you wouldn't <U>give</U> it to your baby, don't <U>take</U> it when 
you're pregnant!"  But <B>Give and Take</B> can mean a lot of other things, too.  A healthy 
baby isn't just your responsibility.  Your partner, family, friends, and community are responsible, 
too.  It's a give and take relationship for everyone.<P>
Some people say alcohol and drug realated birth defects are completely preventable.  But this is 
not true.  More than half of all pregnancies are unplanned.  This means many women might not 
know they're pregnant for several weeks or months.  So they continue to drink or use drugs the 
way they normally do.  If this happened to you, don't panic.  Find out what steps you can take 
now to make sure both you and your baby are healthy.  That's where this booklet might 
help.<P>
<H3><A NAME = stress></A>Give and Take:  women, 
stress, and pregnancy</H3>
Some people think pregnancy is a beautiful and peaceful time in a woman's life.  For some 
women, pregnancy can be like this.  But it might not be this way for other women.  They enjoy 
being mothers.  But they also know how difficult it is to raise kids.  And for some women, 
motherhood and pregnancy can be even more difficult.  Here are some examples:<P>
<UL>
<LI>you don't have enough money
<LI>you have other children or another job
<LI>you are lonely, isolated, and have no support
<LI>you are in an abusive relationship
</UL>
Other people might not understand your situation.  This can be hard on you.  And other things 
can make pregnancy even more difficult.  Here are some examples:<P>
<OL>
<B><LI>Many women don't plan to get pregnant.</B>  At least half of all pregnancies 
aren't planned.  Many women don't know they're pregnant until the second trimester (fourth 
month or 13 weeks).
<B><LI>Men who abuse women often start when the woman is pregnant.</B>  Many 
women find their partners were not abusive before they became pregnant.  But many men start 
to abuse women during pregnancy.
<B><LI>Some pregnant women have partners with alcohol or drug problems.</B>  
These women don't get enough emotional or physical support.  And they have to cope with the 
extra stress of living with a problem drinker or drug user.
</OL>
<B>You're not the only one responsible!</B><P>Other people affect the health of both you and your baby.  Your partner, family, and 
friends can all help you have a healthy baby.  Here's how:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>They can respect and support your decisions.</B> Ask others to respect and 
support you. Try not to let them put pressure on you. For example, your family and friends 
might think it's OK to drink or take drugs when you're pregnant.  They might tell you about 
other women who drank or used drugs and had healthy babies.  Make your own decisions.  
Tell them you can't compare yourself to other women.  Tell them you want to cut down or quit.  
Get information.  Start by looking through this booklet.
<B><LI>They can put your needs first.</B>  Other people's drug use can affect you and 
your baby's health.  It's OK to tell people not to smoke, drink, or use other drugs around you.  
This is not always easy to do.  But remember it's your right.
</UL>
<B>Try these ideas:</B><P><UL>
<B><LI>Get good information about pregnancy.</B>  Ask a doctor, community health 
nurse, midwife, or pharmacist.  Read books.  Find out as much as you can.  Look on page 69 
for books and other resources.
<B><LI>Sign up for pre-natal classes.</B>  Many communities have free classes, 
especially for women in high stress situations. Look on page 64 for ways to find support. 
<B><LI>If your partner, family, or friends are supportive, ask them for help.</B>  This 
could be anything from helping with housework to telling people not to use alcohol and other 
drugs around you.
<B><LI>Look for professional support.</B>  If you need professional support, find 
someone you feel comfortable with.  If you don't get the help you need, ask for a referral to 
someone else.  This is your right.  Look on page 64 for places to get support.
<B><LI>Get help if your partner abuses you.</B>  If your partner mistreats you in any 
way, this is abuse.  You don't have to put up with it.  And it's against the law.  Look on page 65 
for places to call.
</UL>
<H3><A NAME = alcohol></A>Give and Take:  alcohol, 
drugs, and pregnancy</H3>
It's easy to see many reasons why a pregnant woman might use alcohol or other drugs.  Most 
people use drugs of one kind or another.  People use alcohol and other drugs to relax, have fun,  
relieve boredom, deal with problems or stress, or to improve their health.<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Fact:  If you're pregnant, remember: nobody knows exactly how much alcohol, tobacco, or 
other drugs can harm your baby.</FONT><P>
Health professionals say it's best not to drink, smoke, or use any drugs at all.  Try to cut down if 
you can't quit.  Less is better.  None is best.  (Check with your doctor, midwife, community 
health nurse, or pharmacist if you take medication for a medical reason.  Make sure the drugs 
are safe for pregnant women.)<P>
<B>How do alcohol and other drugs affect your baby?</B><P>Different problems can happen at different stages.  It depends on whether you drink or 
take drugs early or late in your pregnancy.  Unfortunately, no one knows for sure when the most 
harm can happen.  It depends on when, how much, and how often you drink or take drugs.<P>
But one thing is for sure.  It doesn't matter if you drink, smoke, swallow, snort, or inject them.  
All drugs (including alcohol, medication, and cigarettes) sooner or later reach your bloodstream.  
Then they pass from you into the baby's bloodstream.  So even small amounts of alcohol and 
other drugs can reach your baby.<P>
<B>Hard to believe?</B><P>It's easy to see why.  You (or your friends) might have used alcohol or other drugs during 
another pregnancy. And those children seem perfectly healthy.  Or you feel confused by all the 
different information you hear.  You're right - information about alcohol and other drug use 
during pregnancy <U>can</U> be confusing.  But we know this for sure: using alcohol and 
other drugs during pregnancy can cause babies to have learning, behaviour, or health problems 
as they grow up.<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Fact:  Newborns don't always show the effects caused by alcohol and other drugs right away.  It can take a few years before you see the problems.</FONT><P>
<B>Don't panic!</B><P>It's never too late to cut down or quit.  Both you and your baby will benefit.  Call a 
community health nurse, midwife, counsellor, or doctor you trust for more information or 
support.<P>
<B>Are you afraid to talk to others?</B><P>Many pregnant women who use alcohol or other drugs don't tell anyone.  They're afraid 
someone will take their baby.  Talk to someone you can really trust.  Figure out your choices.  
Make a decision.  Then get support to do it!  Phone these private and confidential places for 
information.<P>
<B>For more information or support ...</B><P><B>Phone a health unit or community health centre.</B>  The number is in 
the phone book under the name of your city, town, or county.<P>

Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto M5G 1X8.  If you have a social

Give and Take<BR>
Pregnant Women and the Effects of Alcohol and Other Drugs</H2>
<H3><A NAME = alcohol2></A>Give and Take:  alcohol 
and pregnancy</H3>
In the past, people didn't know alcohol could harm a baby.  But research shows that alcohol 
passes from you to the baby.  The more you drink, the more harmful it can be.  Alcohol is in 
liquor, liqueur, coolers, beer, and wine.<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Fact:  During pregnancy, any alcohol you drink has twice the effect on your baby's system as it 
does on yours.</FONT><P>
<B>Should you drink at all when pregnant?</B><P>
Nobody knows how much drinking can harm a baby.  So it's safest not to drink at all if you're 
pregnant.  Here's why:<P>
<UL>
<LI>even small amounts of alcohol (such as one or two drinks) daily or a few times a week 
might affect you and the baby
<LI>the harm can happen any time in the first, second, or third trimester of pregnancy
<LI>even one heavy drinking session can cause harm (especially during your first three months 
or the first trimester)
</UL>
But the most harm is caused by regular heavy drinking.  If you drink regularly during pregnancy, 
the following things can happen: <P>
<UL>
<B><LI>problems during pregnancy. </B> This includes miscarriage, stillbirth, and 
premature delivery.
<B><LI>problems when the baby is born</B>.  The baby could go into withdrawal when 
it's born.  Withdrawal is like a big hangover.  The effects are trembling, being very cranky, and 
having no appetite.  The baby could even have a seizure (or a fit).
<B><LI>problems as the baby grows.</B>  Some people call this "fetal alcohol syndrome" 
(FAS) or "fetal alcohol effects" (FAE).  Many people now call this "alcohol related birth 
defects" (or ARBD).
</UL>
These could be signs a baby has FAS or ARBD:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>They are sick a lot.</B>  Many babies have minor illnesses.  But a baby with 
ARBD will be sick a lot more than other babies.
<B><LI>They are too small and weak.</B>  The baby can be born small.  Low birth 
weight babies stay smaller as they grow up.
<B><LI>They are slow or have a hard time learning.</B>  They might have behaviour or 
emotional problems.  This can be very frustrating for you and your child.
<B><LI>They can't understand and concentrate.  </B>Children with ARBD take a lot 
more time and energy to look after.
</UL>
<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Fact:  Babies don't grow out of alcohol related birth defects.  They have them for 
life.</FONT><P>
<B>Feel confused?</B><P>
It's no wonder!  People disagree about drinking in pregnancy.  But here's what we know for 
sure:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Binge drinking is more harmful than having the same amount on several occasions.
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>For example, drinking 12 ounces of liquor in one day is more harmful than drinking 12 
ounces of liquor spread over a week.
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>Drinking causes different problems depending on the stage of your pregnancy.
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol causes different effects depending on the trimester.  Ask a doctor, midwife, or 
community health nurse for information about these different effects.
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>The effects of drinking are different for every woman and her baby. 
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>You can't compare yourself to your friends.  Some women and their babies will be 
affected more than others.  Nobody knows why for sure.  But eating habits, living conditions, 
and using other drugs (including tobacco) all play a part.
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>It's never too late to cut down or quit.
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>Try to cut down or quit as soon as possible. You're more likely to have a healthy baby - 
even if you drank heavily!
</UL>
<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Fact:  When you are pregnant, less alcohol is better.  No alcohol is best.</FONT><P>
<B>What if it's hard to cut down or quit?</B><P>
Some women will find it more difficult than others.  This has nothing to do with willpower.  It 
depends on your situation and how much, how often, and how long you've been drinking.  
Sometimes, pregnant women keep drinking because it seems easier than trying to cut down or 
quit.  But here are some suggestions:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>If they are supportive, ask your partner, family, and friends to help.</B>  Tell 
them you're trying to cut down or quit.  Ask them not to drink around you.  It's your right!
<B><LI>Phone a counsellor.</B>  Look on page 64 for private and confidential places to 
phone.
<B><LI>Talk to a doctor</B>, especially if yours is supportive.  If you don't get what you 
need, it's your right to see another doctor,  midwife, or community health nurse.
</UL>
<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Fact: When you're pregnant, it's safest  not to drink at all.</FONT><P>
<B>Your partner</B><P>
Your partner should support you and help you have a healthy baby.  But all women don't have 
a partner's support.  Here are some ideas for women in either situation:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>If your partner is supportive, ask them to help.</B>  Cut down or quit together.  
This makes it easier for both of you.  But only ask for support if it's safe.  Remember: you are 
the expert on your home situation.
<B><LI>If your partner won't stop drinking</B> and it bothers you, ask them to drink 
somewhere else.  Situations that involve heavy drinking aren't the best place for you to be.  It's 
OK to find a safe place.
<B><LI>If your partner mistreats you in any way</B>, this is abuse.  Men who abuse 
women often start when the woman gets pregnant.  You don't have to put up with any type of 
abuse.  Get outside help.  Look on page 65 for places to call.
</UL>
<B>Your family and friends</B><P>
Your family and friends might think it's OK for you to drink when you're pregnant.  They might 
even tell you about other women who drank and had healthy babies.  Tell them you can't 
compare yourself to anyone else.  Tell them you're trying to cut down or quit.  Ask them to 
respect and support your decisions.<P>
<FONT COLOR="FFFF00">Remember: it's give and take!</FONT><P>
<H3><A NAME = smoking></A>Give and Take: smoking 
and pregnancy</H3>
In the past, people didn't know that a baby could be harmed by smoking.  But now research

<B>Hard to believe?</B><P>You probably know women who smoked and had big, healthy-looking babies.  But it's

cannabis and pregnancy</H3>
Cannabis includes marijuana (pot or grass), hash, and hash oil.  They all have THC in them.  
THC is a drug that changes the way you think, feel, and act.  After the legal drugs, cannabis is 
the drug used most often by pregnant women.<P>
People disagree about the effects cannabis can have on you and your baby.  Some reasons 
are:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Pregnant women who use cannabis often use other drugs.</B>  This includes 
alcohol and tobacco.  So it's hard to tell which effects are caused by the cannabis.
<B><LI>Many people don't think cannabis is harmful.</B>  It's easier to see effects of 
other drugs (such as cocaine or heroin).  The effects of cannabis aren't as obvious.  So it's hard

<B><LI>Cannabis can harm your immune system.</B>  This is the system in your body 
that fights off sickness and disease.
<B><LI>Most cannabis is stronger than it used to be.</B>  This is because of the way 
cannabis is grown.  It has more THC in it now than it used to.
<B><LI>THC stays in your body up to 3 weeks.</B>  THC is the longest acting drug of 
all.  This is true for all kinds of cannabis.  It doesn't matter if you smoke it or eat it.  It stays in 
your body for a long time.
<B><LI>Smoking cannabis can cause lung diseases.</B>  This includes bronchitis, 
emphysema, and cancer.
</UL>
<B>The effects of cannabis on pregnancy</B><P>For pregnant women, smoking cannabis means:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Your baby doesn't get enough oxygen.
<LI>Your baby might be born too soon if you use cannabis regularly.
<LI>You might take longer to figure out you're pregnant.  Cannabis hides some early signs of 
pregnancy (such as nausea or morning sickness).  This can make it harder to tell if you're 
pregnant.  So you use cannabis while you're pregnant without meaning to.

drug you used.  Examples are:
<UL>
<B><LI>Cocaine and speed</B> cause babies to be very restless.  They cry a lot and can't 
sleep.
<B><LI>Heroin</B> causes many problems.  Babies can't breathe properly.  They can't 
sleep and are very cranky.  They have a high fever, with vomiting and diarrhea.
<B><LI>LSD and other hallucinogens</B>.  People who use hallucinogens often use other

<B><LI>an abusive partner.</B>  They hurt, threaten, or mistreat you in any way. This

<B><LI>not enough money.</B>  You might not have a paid job.  Or you don't make 
enough money at your job.  So, for example, you aren't able to eat as well as you'd like when 
you're pregnant.

<B>How to use OTCs safely</B><P>Here are some ideas for using OTCs safely.<P>
<OL>
<B><LI>Pain killers</B><BR>
Always check with a doctor, midwife, or pharmacist before you take any pain killer.  And 
remember:  there is caffeine in many of them.  Look on page 36 for more information.
<UL>
<B><LI>Acetaminophen</B>.  Acetaminophen (or Tylenol without codeine) is the safest 
choice.  It's OK to take it once in a while throughout your pregnancy.
<B><LI>Ibuprofen</B>.   Ibuprofen (or Advil) seems to be safe up to week 32 of your 
pregnancy.  This means, to be on the safe side, don't take ibuprofen after your sixth month (or 
the end of the second trimester).  It can <U>cause birth defects</U> in the last 6 to 8 weeks of 
your pregnancy.
<B><LI>ASA</B>.  ASA (or Aspirin) doesn't seem to cause birth defects.  But it can 
<U>cause bleeding</U> when you're pregnant and during labour.  So do not take ASA unless 
you talk to a doctor or midwife first.   And never take ASA close to your due date.
<B><LI>Codeine</B>.  Codeine (222s or Tylenol with codeine) may be safe once in a while.  
But remember: codeine <U>makes you constipated</U>.  Also some codeine pills have ASA 
in them, too.  And ASA can cause bleeding.
</UL>
<B><LI>Anti-histamines and anti-nauseants</B><BR>
Remember:  there is also caffeine in many OTC anti-histamines.  Look on page 36 for more 
information about caffeine.<BR>
Always check with a doctor, pharmacist or midwife before you take anti-histamines (such as 
Contac C) and anti-nauseants (such as Gravol).  Or try these ways to deal with symptoms:
<UL>
<LI>if you have a cold or flu, do what your mother always said!  Rest and drink lots of fluids.  
OTCs don't cure cold or flu.
<LI>if you have morning sickness, look on page 57 for helpful ideas.
<LI>if you have allergies or hay fever, make sure your anti-histamine is safe.  Find out from a 
doctor, midwife, or pharmacist.
</UL>
<B><LI>Antacids</B><BR>Don't use the fizzy types of antacids (such as Alka Seltzer).  They are full of salt which can 
give you high blood pressure.  And isn't good for the baby, either!  Other types of antacids 
(such as Amphojel, Gelusil, or Maalox) are safe for pregnant women to use once in a while.  
Look on page 58 for other ideas.
<B><LI>Anti-diarrhea medicines</B><BR>You can safely use Kaopectate or Kaocon for diarrhea that lasts one or two days.  But if 
diarrhea lasts longer, see a doctor.  Diarrhea is dangerous for pregnant women.  You lose too 
much water from your body.  This makes you dehydrated.
<B><LI>Constipation medicines (or laxatives)</B><BR>Some constipation medicines are safe during pregnancy.  These are called "bulk-forming".  
An example is Metamucil.  Ask a doctor or pharmacist before you take any other kind.  Look 
on page 57 for ideas to help with constipation.
<B><LI>Diet pills</B><BR>Diet pills are never healthy.  They make you restless and anxious.  They upset your sleep 
and your stomach.  Instead, try to eat well and stay healthy.  Gaining 25 or 30 pounds is part of 
a healthy pregnancy.  This means pregnant women need an extra 300 calories (a muffin, a glass 
of milk, and an apple) per day.  Breast-feeding women need an extra 450 calories.  So this is 
not the time to diet!

</UL>
Before you take any drug, get as much information as you can.   Ask yourself if you know all 
the risks and benefits.  If possible, find out other ideas to try instead of taking drugs.  Talk to a 
pharmacist, community health nurse, or midwife.<P>
<B>A final word about pregnancy and prescription drugs</B><P>There are other ways you might get prescription drugs besides getting them from your 
doctor.  Maybe a friend or family member gives you some of their prescription.  Or you have 
drugs leftover from an old prescription.  And sometimes these drugs are sold on the street 
illegally.  If you take prescription drugs in any of these situations, be careful.  Find out if they are 
safe for you and your baby.  If you don't want to ask your doctor, check on page 66 for other 
places to get information.<P>

<H3><A NAME = breastfeeding></A>Give and 
Take:  alcohol, other drugs and breast-feeding</H3>
Breast-feeding is great for your baby.  Even if you use alcohol or other drugs, breast-feeding is 
still the best choice.  But remember: a little bit of most things you eat or drink passes through 
your breast milk to your baby.  This means your breast milk is affected by alcohol and other 
drugs.  No one knows for sure what all the effects are.  So remember it's give and take.  If you 
wouldn't give it to your baby, don't take it while you're breast-feeding!<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Fact:   Small amounts of any drug you take (including alcohol and cigarettes) will be in your 
breast milk.</FONT><P>
Here is some information about the effects of alcohol and other drugs on breast-feeding.<P>
<B>Alcohol</B><P>Information about drinking and breast-feeding is very confusing.  Alcohol shows up in your 
breast milk.  But people disagree about the amount that causes problems.  So doctors and 
midwives usually tell breast-feeding mothers not to drink.<P>
If you do drink and breast-feed, remember:<P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>your baby might not drink enough milk
<LI>your baby might not sleep well
</UL>
</UL>
It depends on how much and when you drink.  So try not to drink an hour or so 
<U>before</U> you breast-feed.  Instead, have the drink right <U>after</U> you breast-feed.  
Then your body has time to get rid of the alcohol before the next feeding.<P>
If you drink regularly and breast-feed, the alcohol can affect how well your baby develops 
mentally and physically.  The baby's brain is still developing for up to 12 months after it's born.  
So the alcohol can cause brain damage.  Heavy drinking can also affect your "let down" (the 
milk flowing into your nipples so the baby can feed).<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Fact:   A drink once in a while (especially right after you breast-feed) probably won't harm your 
baby.  But remember:  less alcohol is better, none is best.</FONT><P>
<B>Smoking</B><P>Even if you smoke, breast-feeding is best for your baby.  Just don't smoke at the time 
your baby is feeding.  Always protect your baby from second-hand smoke.  Smoke from other 
people's cigarettes is harmful to both of you.   Look on page 20 for more information.<P>
<B>Over-the-counter and prescription drugs </B><P>If you breast-feed and take prescription or over-the-counter drugs (including painkillers, 
laxatives, antacids, and cold medicines) remember to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>always check with your doctor first
<LI>remind your doctor you are breast-feeding
<LI>ask if the drug is safe or if there is a safer one
<LI>watch for any effects on your baby (including poor feeding, rashes, upset stomach, and 
being cranky)
</UL>
It's a good idea to take prescription or over-the-counter drugs right <U>after</U> you feed 
your baby.  Then there will be less of the drug in your milk the next time you feed the baby.<P>
<B>Street drugs</B><P>Very little is known about the effects of cannabis, speed, cocaine, heroin, or LSD on 
breast-feeding.  But they can have these effects on your baby:<P>
<UL>
<LI>extreme restlessness (or hyperactivity)
<LI>drowsiness (or sedation)
<LI>poor feeding
</UL>
And if you are dependent on (or addicted to) a street drug, the baby can become dependent 
too.  The baby can go through mild withdrawal between feedings.<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF0000>Fact:   It's a good idea not to drink or use drugs when breast-feeding. Try to cut down or quit.  </FONT>

ideas to try when you're pregnant</H3>
Remember these important facts!<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Give yourself the right to put your needs first.</B>  Ask for support and 
encouragement when you need it.  Take time out for yourself.  Make sure other people help you 
in every way they can.  It's your right to have this support, especially when you're  pregnant.
<B><LI>Find support for choices you make about alcohol and other drugs.</B>  It's 
your decision to cut down or quit.  Decide what's right for you.  Then ask your partner, friends, 
and family to respect your choices.
<B><LI>Get help if you need it.</B>  It's your right to get help with anything from practical 
support (for child care and housework) to professional help (such as counselling).  Look on

</UL>
<H3><A NAME = notfeeling></A>When you're not 
feeling well ...</H3>
Many women have some of the following physical symptoms during pregnancy.  Try these ideas 
instead of using alcohol or other drugs to cope. <P>
<B>Nausea (or morning sickness)</B><P><UL>
<LI>Eat dry toast, crackers, dry cereal, or unsalted popcorn or pretzels at least half an hour 
before you get out of bed in the morning if you can.
<LI>Make sure you eat a small breakfast after you get over the nausea.
<LI>Keep crackers or unsalted popcorn or pretzels with you to eat when your stomach feels 
upset.  Try different dry snacks until you find one that helps.
<LI>Eat four or five small meals a day instead of two or three big ones.
<LI>Drink apple or grape juice or flat pop between meals.
<LI>Open a window or use a fan when you cook to get rid of strong smells.  (Better yet, have 
someone else cook for you!)
<LI>Avoid greasy, fried, or spicy foods or any food that makes you feel sick.
<LI>Try to cook at the time of day you feel best.
<LI>Eat healthy food if you can.  But eat whatever you can if it appeals to you.
</UL>
<B>Constipation</B><P><UL>
<LI>Drink lots of water and other liquids such as fruit juice.
<LI>Eat a salad each day, if possible.
<LI>Drink a glass of warm water as soon as you get up in the morning.
<LI>Eat foods high in fibre such as beans, whole wheat bread and cereal, and raw fruits and 
vegetables.  Or add bran to your food when possible.
<LI>The iron in prenatal vitamins can cause constipation.  So you will need more fibre if you 
take these vitamins.
<LI>Try prunes or prune juice - this really works!  Water down the juice to make it taste 
better.
<LI>Get mild exercise such as a walk every day.
</UL>
<B>Heartburn</B><P><UL>
<LI>Try crackers and toast before a meal - this can help with stomach acid.
<LI>Eat four or five small meals a day instead of two or three big ones.
<LI>Bake or broil food instead of frying it.
<LI>Move around after eating - don't lie down!
<LI>Drink liquids after and between meals instead of with your meals.
<LI>Drink milk if your body can handle it.
<LI>Drink small amounts of chocolate milk if you don't like plain milk.
<LI>Eat less spicy or fatty foods.
<LI>Cut down on caffeine (including cola drinks) - drink more water instead.
<LI>Eat slowly and at a time you feel relaxed.
<LI>Keep a record of what you eat so you can figure out which foods cause heartburn.
<LI>Prop some pillows behind your back.  Use your couch cushions behind your pillows for 
extra support.  This can help with night time heartburn.
</UL>
<B>Sleeping problems</B><P><UL>
<LI>Take a relaxing bath.

<LI>Sleep on your side.
<LI>Tuck a pillow between your knees and under your stomach.

Try these ideas.<P>
<OL>
<B><LI>Have fun</B> without alcohol and other drugs.  Ask a friend over to play cards or 
watch a video. Have a (decaf!) coffee with a family member in a smoke-free restaurant.  Take 
your partner on a date or to a movie.  Do things that make <U>you</U> feel good.
<B><LI>Drink mocktails</B> or drinks that don't have alcohol in them.  Mix soda or tonic 
half and half with orange, cranberry, or apple juice.  Most books on pregnancy have other ideas 
for mocktails.  Look on page 69 for a list of good books.
<B><LI>Switch to decaf</B> if you drink coffee.  Or try herbal teas.  But find out from a 
doctor, nurse, or midwife which ones are safe to drink during pregnancy.
<B><LI>Eat as well as you can afford to.</B>   Eating well can be tough if you're on a 
budget.  Do the best you can.  Find out what a pregnant woman's body needs.  Remember:  
pregnant women need an extra 300 calories (a muffin, a glass of milk, and an apple) per day.  
Breast-feeding women need an extra 450 calories.  Many women also need prenatal vitamins. 
Ask your doctor, community health nurse, or midwife for more information.  They can tell you 
what you can get under your drug plan or drug card.
<B><LI>Take short rest breaks</B> for even 15 or 20 minutes.  They can really help with 
stress.  Give yourself permission to take one or two breaks during the day.  Put your feet up.  
Or lie down to ease the pressure on your back.
<B><LI>Exercise</B> helps in many ways.  You're probably tired of hearing this!  But it's 
true.  Exercise relieves stress if you're trying to cut down or quit drinking or using drugs.  
Exercise also helps keep your body healthy.  Walk, swim, or play ball with your family.   Get 
other ideas from a health professional. 
<B><LI>Massage</B> your forehead, neck and shoulders, and back.  Find out about ways 
to massage yourself.  Or ask your partner, a friend, or a family member to massage you.  Just 
make sure you ask someone who makes you feel comfortable and relaxed.
<B><LI>Try to find child care</B> if you have other kids.  Looking after kids when you're 
pregnant can be exhausting.  Phone your local community information centre if you need extra 
help or time away from your children.  Find out about family day care and play groups in your 
area.  Or make a plan with friends and neighbours to look after each other's kids.
<B><LI>Ask for support</B> from your partner, family, and friends.  Ask them not to drink, 
smoke, or use drugs around you.  You have the right to ask others to support and respect your 
choices.
<B><LI>Pick up the phone</B> and call a community health centre or health unit.  Ask for 
more information about staying healthy during pregnancy.  They will give you tips on exercise, 
nutrition, and relaxation.  They can also refer you to prenatal classes.
<B><LI>Talk to others</B> about stress or worries.  Many women say pregnancy is 
stressful.  Just talking to someone else helps.  And it helps the other person too!  Meet other 
pregnant women at a drop-in centre or prenatal classes. Or talk to a close friend.  And if they 
can't help, maybe a professional can.  Look on page 64.

<H2>Introduction</H2>
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome has been recognized in Canada as one of the leading causes of 
preventable birth defects and developmental delay in children.<P>
In response to this significant public health concern, national associations representing medical, 
nursing and midwifery disciplines, aboriginal and multicultural groups, and other organizations 
known for their extensive work in the area of FAS/FAE, developed and support this <I>Joint 
Statement on Prevention of Fetal Alcohol  Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects in 
Canada</I> (a list of co-signatories is attached).<P>
The purpose of this statement is to provide relevant and factual information to guide health care 
professionals in the treatment or counselling of women, their partners and families with respect 
to alcohol intake during pregnancy.<P>
No single group, organization, community, ministry, or level of government can deal effectively 
with the problem on its own. Broad-based efforts are required, given that everyone has a stake 
in addressing this complex issue.<P>
<H2>Definitions</H2>
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, or FAS, is a medical diagnosis that refers to a set of alcohol-related 
disabilities associated with the use of alcohol during pregnancy. The minimum criteria for 
diagnosing a child with FAS are:<P>
<UL TYPE=square>
<LI>prenatal and/or postnatal growth restriction;
<LI>central nervous system involvement, such as neurological abnormalities, developmental 
delays, behavioural dysfunction, learning disabilities or other intellectual impairments, and skull 
and brain malformations;
<LI>characteristic facial features: short eye slits (palpebral fissures), a thin upper lip, flattened 
cheek bones, and an indistinct groove between the upper lip and nose (such characteristics are 
not to be confused with facial features that occur normally in different racial groups).
</UL>
"Possible fetal alcohol effects" (FAE) indicates that alcohol is being considered as one of the 
possible causes of a child's birth defects.1 This term is used to describe children with prenatal 
exposure to alcohol, but only some FAS characteristics. These may include reduced or delayed 
growth of the baby, single birth defects or developmental learning and behavioural disorders that 
may not be noticed until months or years after the child's birth.<P>
Exposure to alcohol before birth can lead to long-term developmental disabilities in the form of 
either FAS or possible FAE. Although there are no statistics regarding the extent of FAS/FAE 
in Canada, it is estimated that one to three children in every 1000 in industrialized countries will 
be born with FAS (Coles 1993; Quinby and Graham 1993). The rate may be several times 
higher for children born with possible FAE. These figures may be conservative, given how 
difficult it is to establish the frequency of a birth defect that (1) is hard to identify at birth; (2) 
may be confused with other health problems, and; (3) must be diagnosed by physical 
examination and consideration of a person's medical history, rather than a laboratory test.<P>
Alcohol is a known teratogen which can cause birth defects by affecting the growth and proper 
formation of the fetus's body and brain (Olson, 1992). Alcohol can damage the fetus throughout 
pregnancy, not just in the first trimester. When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, it rapidly 
crosses the barrier of the placenta, producing equivalent concentrations in fetal circulation. The 
brain and central nervous system of the unborn child are especially sensitive to prenatal alcohol 
exposure.<P>
FAS is more likely to occur following continuous or heavy intake of alcohol during pregnancy 
(Streissguth, 1989; Olsen, 1992).2 Effects have been observed also after intermittent or binge 
drinking. Other studies (Streissguth, 1990; Day, 1994; Jacobson, 1994) have shown that 
children born to mothers who have on average one to two drinks per day or may occasionally 
have up to five or more drinks at a time, are at increased risk for learning disabilities and other 
cognitive and behavioural problems.3<P>
Still, there is no definitive information that can be conveyed to women regarding a safe quantity 
of alcohol use during pregnancy. Consequently, <B><I>the prudent choice for women who 
are or may become pregnant is to abstain from alcohol.</B></I><P>
<H2>Prevention Efforts</H2>
Prevention is clearly the first line of defense against the effects of alcohol in pregnancy, and 
should include the following:<P>
<UL TYPE=square>
<I><B><LI>Primary prevention</B></I> - actions that avert a health problem before it 
occurs. In the case of FAS/FAE, this would include informing the public, particularly young 
people, about the dangers of drinking during pregnancy and on a broader level, addressing 
determinants of health.
<I><B><LI>Secondary prevention</B></I> - actions that identify persons at risk. 
Strategies should include screening and early intervention programs and services for pregnant 
women and women of childbearing potential who may be at risk for having a child with 
FAS/FAE.
<I><B><LI>Tertiary prevention</B></I> - actions that prevent recurrence of the condition 
through treatment and attempts to lessen the cognitive, behavioral, and social impact of 
FAS/FAE. Strategies should include diagnosis and programs designed specifically for children 
with FAS/FAE and their caregivers, as well as treatment for women and their partners who 
already have one FAS/FAE child and plan to have more children.
</UL>
Because pregnant women generally are receptive to suggestions about controlling their alcohol 
consumption during pregnancy, the health care professional is presented with an excellent 
opportunity to encourage behavioural change. Early recognition of women who drink alcohol 
during pregnancy and appropriate counselling are the cornerstones of treatment. Health 
professionals can play a key role in reducing the risks associated with alcohol use during 
pregnancy.<P>
<H2>Recommendations</H2>
FAS/FAE are preventable. To that end, it is recommended that:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Prevention efforts should target women before and during their childbearing years, as well 
as those who influence such women, including their partners, families, and the community. All 
efforts should be: <B><I>family-centred and culturally sensitive</B></I>, to address the 
pregnant woman as well as her partner and family in the context of their community; and 
<B><I>comprehensive</B></I>, to draw on all services appropriate to the often complex 
social, economic and emotional needs of these women.<BR>

<LI>Information should be provided to all health professionals regarding the risks of alcohol use 
during pregnancy to facilitate early recognition of at-risk  drinking and early intervention.<BR>

<LI>Continuing education programs for health professionals designed to enhance counselling 
skills that motivate and support lifestyle change for at-risk drinkers, should be widely 
disseminated and evaluated. Furthermore, health professionals should acquaint themselves with 
resources available in their community to provide support and motivation for change for at-risk 
drinkers.<BR>

<LI>Health professionals working with members and leaders of communities must provide 
consistent information to women and their partners that the prudent choice would be to not 
drink alcohol during pregnancy.<BR>

<LI>Health professionals play an essential role in identifying women who drink at levels that 
pose a risk to the fetus and themselves. Screening methods4 should be applied to identify 
women at high risk for heavy alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy. Similarly, 
health professionals have a responsibility to inform women at risk, and to initiate appropriate 
referrals and supportive interventions.<BR>

<LI>Alcohol and drug addiction treatment services should incorporate the needs of women, 
including transportation and daycare, into their program design. Pregnant women seeking help 
should be given high priority at alcohol and drug addiction treatment centres.<BR>

<LI>Health professionals should inform women who consumed small amounts of alcohol 
occasionally during pregnancy, that the risk to the fetus in most situations is likely minimal. They 
should also explain that the risk is relative to the amount of alcohol consumed, body type, 
nutritional health and other life-style characteristics specific to the expectant mother. If exposure 
has occurred, health professionals should inform mothers that stopping at anytime will have 
benefits for both fetus and mother.<BR>

<LI>Health professionals, including family physicians, paediatricians and others to whom 
children are referred, should increase their awareness of maternal alcohol use in pregnancy to 
identify the possible causes of birth defects and other developmental disorders and to identify 
and prevent adverse risks for subsequent pregnancies.<BR>

<LI>Communication between researchers and health-care providers must be an ongoing 
process to determine and evaluate the most effective means of primary, secondary, and tertiary 
prevention of FAS/FAE.
</OL>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
Alcohol use during pregnancy is a national health concern. Health professionals across Canada 
are committed to identifying and implementing prevention strategies that will reduce the 
incidence of FAS/FAE.<P>

WOMEN'S ISSUES STREAM; <B><I>Give and Take</I>: The Development of 
Health Promotion/Prevention Materials for High Risk Pregnant Women</B><P>
<I>Wendy Reynolds and Sara Raftis</I><P><I>
</I>This session will provide an introduction to the <I>Give and Take</I> prevention kit 
which was developed and distributed by AWARE in Kingston, Ontario, and is based on a 
critical moments strategy. The information in the kit addresses feedback from women in 
high risk populations who report they remain unaware of the effects of alcohol and drugs 
in pregnancy and feel available information is incomplete, judgmental and does not provide 
relevant alternatives.<P>
1b PARENTS' ISSUES STREAM; <B>Birth Parent Panel Discussion</B><P>
Birth parents explore the helps and hindrances on their healing journeys.<P>
1c YOUTH ISSUES STREAM; <B>Experiences, Needs and Support Strategies of 
Young People with FAS/FAE: Perspectives of Young Adults, Parents and Human 
Service Workers</B><P>
<I>Deborah Rutman and Brenda Copeland</I><P><I>
</I>This workshop explores critical themes relating to what FAS/FAE feels like; learning 
with FAS/FAE; transitions to independent living; and pregnancy and parenting as a young 
adult with FAS/FAE. As well, we will highlight key issues faced by workers in serving 
families affected by FAS/FAE, and workers' own needs for resources and education.<P>
1d  LEGAL/CORRECTIONS ISSUES STREAM: <B>Panel Discussion</B><P>
<I>Justice Committee, BC FAS Resource Society</I><P><I>
</I>This session will bring together a diverse panel representing parents of adolescents 
involved with the justice system, psychologist/psychiatrist/counsellors experienced in the 
assessment of these youth, and legal/corrections perspectives. There will be a summary of 
the recently completed study: Prevalence of Youth with FAS in the Justice System. In this 
interactive session, participants will be asked to bring input and solutions from their 
diverse perspectives.<P>
SESSION 2<P>
Friday, November 15<P>
1:30 - 3:00 p.m.<P>
2a WOMEN'S ISSUES STREAM;<B> Successful Outreach Programs Reaching 
Women at Risk</B><P>
A discussion by those working in successful, community-based, outreach programs in BC 
which work with women towards reducing their use of alcohol and drugs in pregnancy 
and on parenting children affected by FAS.<P>
2b PARENTS' ISSUES STREAM: <B>Humour and Laughter for the 
Caregiver</B><P>
<I>Janice Maxwell</I><P><I>
</I>In this experiential workshop, laughter and humour will be used to encourage 
spontaneity, creativity, relaxation and fun.<P>
2c EDUCATIONAL/VOCATIONAL ISSUES STREAM: <B>The Mind of a 
Child</B><P>
<I>Lorna Williams</I><P>
This presentation review the research conducted by Lorna Williams outlined in the video 
entitled, <I>The Mind of a Child</I>,  which documents her work with aboriginal 
children. Renewed approaches to teaching that reveal the intelligence and ability of 
children will be discussed, as well tools to help children build missing skills.<P>
2d COMMUNITY ISSUES STREAM: <B>FAS/NAS Teaching/Learning Challenges 
in Indigenous Contexts</B><P>
<I>William J. Mussell</I><P>
Awareness of FAS/FAS in most indigenous contexts is an early stage. Learning about 
FAS/NAS usually stimulates strong feelings, deep reflections and wonderment about 
effects of alcohol in affected individuals' own lives. Grieving of personal losses is strongly 
indicated. Matters of intervention pose unique challenges. Reasons for these circumstances 
and ways and means to work effectively in indigenous contexts as an agent of change will 
be explored.<P>
SESSION 3<P>
Saturday, November 16<P>
10:30 - 12:00 noon<P>
3a WOMEN'S ISSUES STREAM: <B>Alcohol and Drug Treatment Services for 
Pregnant Women at Risk</B><P>
<I>Carol Savage, Chris Kitteringham and Marie Anderson</I><P>
This session will provide an overview of the alcohol and drug treatment services currently 
available to women in British Columbia. Representatives of the Ministry of Health, and 
several programs offering services to women will present on the range of services 
available and the work being done with women who are pregnant and accessing treatment 
for alcohol and drug problems.<P>
3b PARENT'S ISSUES STREAM:<B> Healing the Pain Within - First Nations 
FAS/FAE Parenting Skills Group</B><P>
<I>Carol Hoof</I><P>
This workshop recognizes that many First Nations families living off-reserve want to 
retain their health and cultural identify. Experiences with alcohol abuse, residential 
schools, foster homes, and prison settings have robbed families of the opportunity to live a 
good life. The workshop is focused on education and support for parents and caregivers of 
children suspected of or diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effects. 
The Medicine Wheel Teachings has been a compelling symbol and teacher for many 
Original people. The Wheel will be used to help participants explore aspects of healthy 
family lifestyles. Strategies for overcoming past wounds will be explored. Making peace 
with the past through ritual and ceremony can help people get to the present. Participants 
will have the opportunity to explore personal components of their own parenting styles of 
First Nations children affected by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects.<P>
3c YOUTH ISSUES STREAM: <B>Getting In Step with Youth: A Substance Abuse 
Primary Prevention Workshop</B><P>
<I>Diane Champion-Smith</I><P>
One of the keys for successful substance abuse prevention in the general population is to 
meaningfully involve young people in the planning, organizing and implementing of 
programs and activities. This session explores how the Kaiser Youth Foundation actively 
involved young people in the development of the resource 'Step by Step', and what alcohol 
and other drug prevention knowledge, information and skills young people need at 
different ages. The workshop will provide opportunities to exchange ideas with other 
participants about strategies and resources in the general population.<P>
3d COMMUNITY ISSUES STREAM: <B>Pregnancy, Substance Misuse, and 
Parenting: Community Integrated Approaches to Prevention, Education and 
Support to High Risk Families</B><P>
<I>Marlene Thio-Watts and Lisa Samms-Maxwell</I><P>
This workshop will focus on programs adapted to the needs of the community with a 
Northern Regional perspective, using a grassroots approach to facilitating treatment and 
recovery for pregnant and parenting women. It will also discuss promoting healthy 
mother-infant relationships in alcohol and drug exposed families and awareness and 
education strategies for the prevention of Fetal Alcohol and Drug Effects.<P>
3e EDUCATIONAL/VOCATIONAL ISSUES STREAM:<B> When Good Techniques 
Don't Work: Trying Differently Rather than Harder</B><P>
<I>Diane Malbin</I><P>
Good parents, teachers and clinicians, using good techniques, are often mystified when 
their strategies seem ineffective in supporting those with FAS/ARND. This session 
explores how otherwise good techniques may be incompatible with the needs of those 
with organic brain differences, and introduces concrete examples and guidelines for 
developing more effective and appropriate interventions.<P>
3f COMMUNITY ISSUES STREAM: <B>Advocacy in Action</B><P>
<I>Jane Holland</I><P>
This workshop will look at what parents can individually or collectively do to obtain the 
supports and services their children need. Specific ideas and strategies will be discussed 
for parents to use.<P>
SESSION 4<P>
Saturday, November 16<P>
1:30 - 3:00 p.m.<P>
4a WOMEN'S ISSUES STREAM:<B> Counselling Pregnant Women with Alcohol 
and Drug Problems</B><P>
<B>Chris Loock and Nancy Poole</B><P><B>
</B>This session will look at respectful, positive intervention strategies which help 
women who are struggling with reducing or stopping their use of alcohol and drugs during 
pregnancy. Information developed for community-based counsellors to use in their work 
with women will be introduced.<P>
4b PARENTS' ISSUES STREAM:<B> Planning for Your Child and Family When It 
Feels Like Nothing Works</B><P>
<I>Brenda Glazerman Knight</I><P>
This supportive session will discuss the issues and experiences that lead to parental despair 
and loss of optimism with a focus on minimizing damage and maximizing resolution for 
the family and child while exploring alternate approaches to caregiving.<P>
4c COMMUNITY ISSUES STREAM: <B>Ktunaxa/Kinbasket Community Healing 
and Intervention Program (CHIP)</B><P>
<I>Jason Louie</I><P>
CHIP uses a community development approach to address the needs of the population of 
children, adults and families/communities affected by FAS/FAE. The process and 
outcomes represent a concerted effort by the Native and non-Native communities working 
in partnership to develop needed support structures. The program aims to create 
conditions that will enable affected persons to work productively and to participate 
actively in the social life of their community.<P>
4e EDUCATIONAL/VOCATIONAL ISSUES STREAM: <B>The Challenge of 
Learning for the Student with FAS/E - Practical Instructional Strategies</B><P>
<I>Julianne Conry and Suzanne Jacobsen</I><P>
This workshop will identify methods for defining a child's needs in an educational setting 
and will provide management strategies and effective instructional techniques. Active 
involvement from the participants will be encouraged.<P>
4f PARENTS' ISSUES STREAM: <B>Foster/Adoptive Parent and Extended Family

<H2><A NAME="nofas">National Teen Summit on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome</A></H2>
<H4>May 16-18, 1997, Xavier University, New Orleans, United States</H4>
<B>Project Description</B><P><B>
</B><B>What:</B> A National Teen Summit on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), 
focusing on peer education and training. Summit workshops will focus on creating an 
effective message and planning an awareness campaign. Other activities will include a 
Teen Town Meeting highlighting existing innovative teen campaigns around the 
country, celebrity presentations and guest speakers. Ananda of BET's "Teen Summit" 
will host the Summit with actor Rodney Grant of "Dances with Wolves".  Other 
invited guests include actor Malik Yoba. singer Aaron Neville, and Representatives 
Jesse Jackson, Jr. and Billy Tauzin<P>
NOFAS is working in conjunction with the Comprehensive School Health Programs 
and Adolescent Health Coordinators in each state, as well as the Council on 
Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, KUJI Center for Teen Pregnancy Prevention, Louisiana 
Maternal Child Health Coalition, Louisiana Office of Public health and March of 
Dimes Birth Defects Foundation in this collaborative effort. The National Teen 
Summit is endorsed by Advocates for Youth, the National Asian Women's Health 
Organization, the National Community Mental Healthcare Council, National Council 
of La Raza, the National Indian Child Welfare Association and United National Indian 
Tribal Youth (UNITY).<P>
<B>When and Where:</B> The Summit is scheduled for Friday, May 16 - Sunday, 
May 18, 1997 at Xavier University in New Orleans. Room and board at Xavier will 
be provided by NOFAS. Students will receive a campus tour.<P>
<B>Who:</B> 100 - 150 ninth and tenth graders from around the country. The 
selection process will include an application and a choice of essay, poster, or video by 
the student explaining what FAS means to them and their community. Other selection 
criteria will include extracurricular activities, community involvement (in volunteer, 
church or other community-based efforts), and a commitment to working on a teen 
awareness campaign in their own communities for one year. Students selected to 
participate in the Summit may be able to earn academic credit if their state has 
mandated a Community Service/Service Learning program.<P>
Each state, through a designated state agency or programs will screen a first round of 
applications (from school districts and/or community organizations) and will then 
submit their nominations to NOFAS. The NOFAS Teen Advisors will make the final 
selections from these nominations. The NOFAS Teen Advisors are Washington, D C 
high school students who ran a highly successful Teen Awareness Campaign in D C. 
last year.<P>
<B>Why:</B> A recent report by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at 
Columbia University says that daughters today are 15 times more likely than their 
mothers to have begun using illegal drugs by age 15. The report strongly recommends 
the launching of a major substance abuse prevention campaign targeting preteen and 
teenage girls.<P>
<B>Goals and Objectives:</B> The overall goal of the Summit is to increase 
awareness of FAS among the teen population nationwide and to encourage healthy 
life choices. Specific objectives include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>increasing access to information on FAS for teens;
<LI>recruiting and training of teens to act as peer educators and to initiate campaigns 
in their own schools and communities, increasing the role of peer education on FAS 
nationally; demonstrating the need for young people to be involved in the planning 
and implementation of national, state, and local efforts to help prevent FAS;
<LI>exploring effective messages and methods of communication, and providing 
education, health and other youth-related program coordinators and community 
workers, as well as parents, with the opportunity to listen to young people's 
perspectives on FAS.
</UL>
<B>Planned Outcomes:</B> During the course of the Summit, teen participants 
will have created a message and a campaign implementation plan to take back to their 
schools and communities.<P>
After the Summit, teen participants will be expected to initiate campaigns in their 
schools and communities. This will be done in collaboration with the State 
Comprehensive School Health Programs, Drug-Free Schools Coordinators, Offices of 
Alcohol and Substance Abuse, State Service Learning Coordinators, or other 
appropriate agencies.<P>
<B>Evaluation Plan:</B> Pre-campaign and post-campaign testing of FAS 
knowledge in schools and communities will be incorporated into the teens' campaign 
implementation plans.<P>
What "Sponsorship" by States will entail:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Financial: NOFAS is requesting that each state agency provide round-trip airfare 
(or other appropriate means of transportation) for two students and one 
chaperone/mentor, as well as a small registration fee of $75 per person ($100 for late 
registration).
<LI>Chaperone/Mentor: NOFAS is requesting that each State designate a chaperone 
to travel with the students to the Summit, to act as a mentor in the participants' 
preparation for the Summit, as well as in the implementation of the teens' campaign 
after the Summit. The mentor will serve as NOFAS' point of contact for sending 
information and materials to Summit participants, and in post-Summit follow-up, and 
reporting on the progress of the teen campaigns.
<LI>Selection Process: State agencies will assist in the participant selection process 
by disseminating application packets throughout their state. In addition to reviewing 
applications from individual schools, state agencies will work with NOFAS in 
recruiting at-risk teens through appropriate community-based organizations.
</UL>
9th or 10th graders should apply to their mentoring agencies by December 15, 1996. 
To find out if a state is already participating in the Summit, and for contact

Alcoholism; Alcoolisme; Dual disorders; Double problématique; FAS/FAE; SAF/EAF; 
Treatment; Traitement<BR>
Author's abstract: There are no systematic studies of alcoholism or alcohol abuse in patients 
with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). These case histories illustrate how such patients may 
present at alcohol treatment programs, and how failure to recognize their FAS symptomatology 
can result in inappropriate diagnoses and management. Awareness of the dual diagnosis of

Author's abstract (partial): The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of alcohol and 
caffeine consumption on birth weight and the possible interaction of these substances with 
smoking. A significant reduction in birth weight was found to be associated with an average 
daily alcohol consumption of three drinks or more after gestational age, infant sex, maternal age, 
parity, weight, and height, and cigarette smoking had been controlled for. There was no 
interaction between smoking and alcohol consumption on birth weight, but a significant relation 
between alcohol consumption and birth weight was observed among nonsmokers as well as 
heavy smokers. Our results indicate that alcohol reduces birth weight, but do not support the 
hypothesis of an interaction between smoking and alcohol consumption.<P>

Author's abstract (partial):  The most notable features of fetal alcohol syndrome involve the face 
and eyes, and include microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, an underdeveloped philtrum and a 
thin upper lip. Evidence of intrauterine or postnatal growth retardation, mental retardation or 
other neurologic abnormalities, and at least two of the typical facial features are necessary to 
make the diagnosis. Complete abstinence during pregnancy is recommended, since alcohol 
consumption in each trimester has been associated with abnormalities, and the lowest innocuous 
dose of alcohol is not known.<P>

Author's abstract (partial): Based on a number of studies involving animals as well as human 
case reports indicating an association between prenatal ethanol exposure and renal 
malformations, it has been suggested that children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) should be 
screened for renal anomalies.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate a group of children 
prenatally exposed to alcohol to determine the incidence of renal anomalies and to evaluate the 
need for such a screening procedure.  Based on these data, children prenatally exposed to 
ethanol do not need to be screened for renal anomalies.<P>

Author's abstract (partial):  Far more studies have reported no significant effects on birth weight 
than have reported significant decreases. The effect of smoking is three times greater than the 
effect of alcohol. When the data were stratified by smoking status, maternal alcohol 
consumption did not have a significant effect on birth weight for non-smokers, but among 
smokers there was a significant linear trend with a threshold for decreased birth weight at about 
an average of two drinks per day. There was also a significant pattern of increased birth weight 
associated with low levels of alcohol consumption, suggesting an inverted 'J-shaped' function 
between drinking during pregnancy and birth weight.<P>

Author's abstract (partial): We present an hypothesis integrating epidemiological, clinical case, 
and basic biomedical research to explain why only relatively few women who drink alcohol 
during pregnancy give birth to children with alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs), in particular, 
fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). We argue that specific sociobehavioral risk factors, e.g. low 
socioeconomic status, are permissive for FAS in that they provide the context for increased 
vulnerability.<P>

Author's abstract (partial)s: I. The authors evaluated the effect of maternal environmental 
tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure during pregnancy and prenatal maternal smoking on child's 
height at age 5 years, using serum cotinine as a biomarker of exposure. They also determined 
the effects of postnatal smoke exposure. II. It is biologically plausible that smoking during 
pregnancy could result in neurobehavioral deficits in the child. Maternal smoking can cause fetal 
hypoxia; for example, nicotine could reduce uteroplacental <BR>
blood flow or carbon monoxide could produce carboxyhemoglobin, and fetal hypoxia may 
affect brain development.<P>

Author's abstract (partial): Case studies and statistical analyses of groups of children with fetal 
alcohol syndrome (FAS) or prenatal exposure to alcohol (PEA) have been performed using 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. These studies show that alcohol exposure during 
pregnancy can result in a range of structural brain abnormalities. Among severely affected 
children, widespread damage may occur to the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, hippocampus, 
and cerebellum.<P>

Author's abstract:  The Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI) was compared 
to urine toxicology screening in a prenatal clinic for the discovery of substance abuse on 560 
patients. SASSI was found to be more selective for drug use than urinalysis, and it gave a 
profile of alcohol use which was absent using the toxicology screen. The authors concluded that 
SASSI was a more effective clinical tool for identifying substance abuse and clearly more cost 
effective than toxicology screening.<P>

Author's abstract:  The incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome is now estimated at 0.97 cases per 
1,000 live births in the general obstetric population and 4.3% among 'heavy' drinkers. The 
general incidence is more than 20 times higher in the United States (1.95 per 1,000) compared 
to Europe and other countries (0.08 per 1,000). Within the United States, the incidence at sites 
characterized by low socioeconomic status, and African American or Native American 
background are about 10 times higher (2.29 cases per 1,000) compared to sites with a 
predominant middle/upper SES and Caucasian background (0.26 per 1,000). Based on racial 
background, the number of pregnant women in the U.S. giving birth to FAS children is 2,043 
per year; if based on socioeconomic status, the number is slightly higher 2,366. Although race 
and SES are confounded in the U.S. studies, an examination of U.S. and European studies 
suggests that the major factor associated with FAS is low SES rather than racial 
background.<P>

Section 1 highlights workers' discussion of the ways in which their practice with FAS children 
and families differs from their work with non-alcohol-affected families. Section 2 presents 
workers' perceptions of parents' experiences and frustrations in accessing support and services 
from the 'system'. Section 3 presents workers' perceptions of the support and/or service needs 
of families caring for a young person with FAS/E. Section 4 presents workers' discussion of 
their own knowledge and resource needs in relation to FAS/E. Section 5 presents some of the 
major issues and needs of adolescents and young adults with FAS/E, as identified by human 
service workers. Section 6 focuses on workers' ideas and strategies regarding the prevention of 
FAS/E. Recommendations for policy and practice are provided at the end of nearly every 
section. <P>

The Canadian Children's Safety Network (CCSN) evolved from discussions at a national childhood injury conference in 1991. An informal network had existed for some time, but a desire to provide a means for increased communication and collaboration emerged, as well as a need to move the problem of injury to a more prominent place on the social and political agenda.<P>
In 1994, the SMARTRISK Foundation, formerly the Canadian Injury Prevention Foundation, was selected to establish the process that would become both a network of people and a structural network for information exchange. The vision was not of a new organization, rather a means for communication among people and groups, brought together by their desire to reduce the potential for injury, guided by the principals of inclusion and leadership through partnership.<P>
<B>The Network:</B>  The Meeting Place is a general discussion area of conference, where new ideas and threads of interest are introduced. Specific discussion takes place in conferences under titles such as home, sports, road, advocacy, etc. You can search conferences for information on specific topics such as research, abstracts, publications, funding sources as well as entries from the Directory of Child/Youth Injury Prevention Programs.<P>

<B>From distributor's description:</B><I> </I> David Vandenbrink seems like a 
normal 21-year-old. There is little to suggest that while in his mother's womb he suffered 
permanent brain damage, a result of the alcohol his mother drank. His condition went 
undiagnosed for the first 18 years of his life, causing confusion, anger and pain for both David 
and his adoptive family. David's story, by award-winning filmmaker, Gil Cardinal, is a hard-

<B>Excerpt from publisher's description</B>: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome provides 
straightforward facts regarding the impact of alcohol consumption as it effects the development of the embryo and fetus. Surveying current research of fetal alcohol syndrome and its related problems, the book addresses the immediate effects on development at various stages. Long-term action of prenatal alcohol exposure later in life is also considered. A chapter devoted to assessing the behavior of children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol emphasizes the necessity of longitudinal studies of fetal alcohol syndrome. This important reference offers a thorough overview of a problem that cannot be ignored. To order, write to: <P>

<TITLE>Pregnancy and Drinking: Your Questions Answered; FAS, Éduc

</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Pregnancy and Drinking: Your 
Questions Answered</H1>
<I><H3>Éduc'alcool</I> and <I>Collège des médecins 
du Québec</H3></I>
<HR>
<I>Éduc'alcool</I> is an independent, not-for-profit organization whose members include associations 
of distillers, wine merchants, wine producers, cider producers, wine and spirit agents, the <I>Régie des 
alcools, des courses et des jeux</I>, the <I>Société des alcools du Québec</I> and private 
individuals.<P>
The partners in the alcoholic beverage industry are well aware of their social responsibility and mission.  
Through <I>Éduc'alcool</I>, they offer a series of informative and educational programs that encourage 
teens and adults to make responsible, enlightened decisions about drinking, and help prevent alcohol 
abuse.<P>
"Pregnancy and Drinking: Your Questions Answered" is one of these <I>Éduc'alcool</I> programs, 
produced in cooperation with the <I>Collège des médecins du Québec</I> in order to offer clear, concise 
answers to the most common questions asked by pregnant women and women planning to have 
children.<P>
This revised and corrected version replaces the original booklet, which was reprinted four times.  It is a 
synthesis of information provided by physicians Harry Bard, head of neonatology at Sainte-Justine 
Hospital, Marie-Chantale Le Monnier of the obstetrics department at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, 
and Jean-Pierre Chiasson, medical director of the <I>Clinique du Nouveau départ</I>.  Their 
contribution is greatly appreciated.<P>
<HR>
<IMG SRC="/educ1.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-1-" HSPACE=3><B>My husband and I have decided to have a child.  Can I continue to drink until I become pregnant? </B><BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Reducing your alcohol intake from the moment you begin trying to conceive will help create a healthy 
environment for the development of your baby.  It's even better to stop drinking altogether, because it is 
often difficult to determine exactly when fertilization takes place, and the embryo is particularly 
vulnerable during the first trimester (three months) of pregnancy.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ2.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-2-" HSPACE=3><B>I've just learned that I'm six months pregnant.  I had a few drinks recently.  Should I be worried about my 
baby?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Absolutely not.  It's never too late to ensure the optimum development of the fetus by cutting down on 
your drinking, or safer still, by not drinking at all.  Developmental problems in the fetus are generally 
linked to excessive, chronic drinking.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ3.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-3-" HSPACE=3><B>I enjoy a glass of wine with a good meal.  Do I have to change my habits during pregnancy?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
To date, researchers have not been able to determine the exact amount of alcohol that is "safe" for the 
development of the fetus.  We do know, however, that the risks of miscarriage, birth defects, growth 
retardation and mental disorders increase the more the mother drinks, and the more frequently she 
drinks.<P>
Moderate, occasional drinking is a responsible approach for a pregnant woman.  However, not drinking at 
all is even safer.<P>
In any case, a pregnant woman who is thinking about drinking, even moderately, should always consult 
her doctor so that she can make the most enlightened decision.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ4.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-4-" HSPACE=3><B>Does heavy drinking affect the fetus?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Yes.  A pregnant woman who frequently drinks a lot is more likely to give birth to a child with a specific 
condition known as fetal alcohol syndrome, or FAS.  FAS includes a number of problems such as growth 
retardation, mental disorders, an abnormally small head or other facial and skeletal abnormalities, and 
malformations of the heart.  Occasional heavy drinking also increases the risk of similar problems.<P>
Any woman who has difficulty controlling her drinking should discuss the problem with her doctor or 
another expert in the field before even thinking about getting pregnant, and then throughout the 
pregnancy, to ensure that she gets the proper support.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ5.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-5-" HSPACE=3><B>Does moderate drinking endanger the unborn child in the same way?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
No.  The risk is reduced considerably if you drink in moderation (one or two glasses of wine).  Alcohol 
becomes increasingly toxic the more you drink and the more frequently you drink. Remember, too, that 
alcohol is never the only factor involved in the development of the baby.  The parents' basic health, their 
medical history, their lifestyle, the mother's diet, outside pollutants, tobacco and drug use during 
pregnancy, and other socioeconomic factors all have an impact.  Even under ideal conditions, no woman 
can completely control her pregnancy.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ6.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-6-" HSPACE=3><B>Why is alcohol bad for the baby?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Alcohol is a toxic substance that is quickly transferred from the mother's bloodstream to the baby's.  
Because all the organs of the fetus are in the process of being formed, they are particularly vulnerable to 
any toxic substance, especially during the first three months of pregnancy.  In the best interests of her 
baby, a pregnant woman should modify certain habits from the very beginning of the pregnancy (cut back 
her drinking, avoid all other toxic substances, watch what she eats, etc.).<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ7.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-7-" HSPACE=3><B>Is it true that wine and beer are less damaging to the fetus than hard liquor?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
No.  Equivalent servings of all three contain exactly the same amount of alcohol.  By "serving", we mean 
one 12-ounce bottle of beer (355 ml), one and a half ounces of hard liquor (44 mil of whisky, gin, vodka,

slowly if she eats before drinking.<P>

If it's important to you on particular occasions, you can safely drink one or two glasses of wine while 
eating, especially at the end of your pregnancy.<P>
Under no circumstances does anyone have the right to urge anyone else to drink.  And nobody should 
make a pregnant woman feel guilty for drinking moderately.  There is no point in alarming anyone 
needlessly.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ9.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-9-" HSPACE=3><B>I've decided to nurse my baby.  Is it OK to have a drink now and then? </B><BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Any woman who is breast-feeding must think about her own well-being and that of her baby.  A nursing 
mother should eat a balanced diet, get plenty of rest, and be careful about drinking.  You should not drink 
while actually nursing, because the baby will absorb the same amount of alcohol as you do, as it nurses.  If 
you combine breast-feeding with bottle-feeding, you can drink moderately on occasion (no more than the 
equivalent of two drinks), and give the baby a bottle at those times.  Be aware that it takes a minimum of 
two hours for your body to eliminate the alcohol in one drink.<P>

The province of Saskatchewan has been a leader in research and program development in 
the area of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome since the mid-1970s. The first diagnosed case of Fetal 
Alcohol Syndrome in Canada was made in Saskatchewan at Royal University Hospital, 
Saskatoon, in 1975. In-depth research into the incidence and prevalence of FAS continues. 
The Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps has conducted education and 
health promotion activities since 1984. In March 1993 the Institute was instrumental in 
forming the Saskatchewan Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Coordinating Committee, a provincial 
interagency committee that coordinates the prevention efforts in the province. Support for 
the program is provided by Canada's Drug Strategy, Health Canada.<P>
<H3>Research and Therapy for FAS</H3>
The Alvin Buckwold Centre (now a program of the Kinsmen Children's Centre), located in 
Royal University Hospital, Saskatoon, has focused on treatment and research in FAS since 
1972. Dr.'s B.F. Habbick, R. Casey, W.A. Zaleski, and F. Murphy were the first Canadians 
to publish findings on liver dysmorphology in FAS patients in March 1979. In-depth 
research into the incidence and prevalence of FAS was being conducted in Saskatchewan 
as early as 1980. A study conducted at the Alvin Buckwold Centre, Saskatoon, from 1980 
to 1982 identified 73 cases of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and 139 cases of Alcohol Related 
Birth Defects. The study won the Sam Rovinovitch Research award from the Canadian 
Council for Exceptional Children. A similar study is in progress at the Kinsmen Children's 
Centre, Saskatoon (formerly Alvin Buckwold Centre).<P>
Intensive therapeutic services for children with FAS have been provided in Saskatchewan 
since the condition was first diagnosed in 1975. To date, services have been provided for 
over 500 Saskatchewan children. To enhance service delivery, a unique multidisciplinary 
program was developed at the Kinsmen Children's Centre in August 1991. The FAS 
Program Team consists of an occupational therapist, physician, physiotherapist, 
psychologist and speech and language pathologist. FAS Clinics are held twice a month, 
providing diagnosis, assessment, treatment and support for children and families effected 
by FAS. Additional support is provided by the Early Childhood Intervention Program and 
preschool programs at the Centre.<P>
<H3>Prevention Education Programs</H3>
The Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps has focused on FAS since the 
early 1980s. The Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps is a provincial non-
profit organization, founded in 1981. The Prevention Institute is funded by a group of 
Shareholders: Government of Saskatchewan, Kinsmen Foundation, Saskatchewan 
Association for Community Living, Saskatchewan Abilities Council, University of 
Saskatchewan, and the community at large. The mandate is to promote province-wide 
awareness of preventive measures to reduce the incidence of handicapping conditions in 
children.<P>
The Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps, in consultation with its Medical 
Advisory Committee, identified Fetal Alcohol Syndrome as a major program area in 1985. 
Since that time, it has developed and delivered prevention awareness information 
throughout the province, and, increasingly, throughout Canada and other countries. 
During the past nine years, the FAS Prevention Program has involved a provincial 
conference, workshops, talks, a research survey and the continuing distribution of videos 
and an FAS Information Kit. Programming has included the following activities:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Media</B>. Public Service Announcements (PSAs) have been developed and 
distributed to media outlets throughout the province. Television and radio spots have been 
developed and aired on Saskatchewan stations since the early 1980s. Other media 
activities have included newspaper and magazine articles and interviews on television and 
radio. The messages are aimed at the general public and provide educational information 
on the dangers of drinking alcohol during pregnancy.
<B><LI>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Effects Conference, </B>November, 1985. Co-
sponsored by the Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps and the 
Saskatchewan Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission. One hundred participants attended, 
including physicians, nurses, social workers, counselors, educators, students, and other 
interested members of the public. Proceedings are available from the Institute.
<B><LI>Community Education. </B>An ongoing program of the Saskatchewan 
Institute on Prevention of Handicaps: Staff make approximately 50 presentations a year on 
prevention topics, including raising awareness of FAS. Participants include health 
professionals, students of all levels from elementary through university, community 
groups, and occupational groups. Staff also attend workshops and conferences on FAS 
and present displays throughout the province.
<B><LI>Physicians' Survey. </B>In conjunction with the Kinsmen Children's Centre of 
Royal University Hospital, the Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps 
conducted a provincial survey of pediatricians and general/family practitioners. Results of 
the survey indicate a high level of awareness among physicians in Saskatchewan.
<B><LI>FAS Information Kits. </B>This resource was first developed in 1985, when 
FAS was identified as a major prevention challenge. The kit has since been updated and 
extended by the inclusion of resource material, including a Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Fact 
Sheet. In the past four years, the Prevention Institute has distributed over 2000 FAS Kits 
to community health offices, nurses, educators, physicians, special education teachers, 
other professionals, media, community members, parents, and foster parents throughout 
Saskatchewan.

</UL>
<H3>Saskatchewan FAS Prevention Program</H3>
Assisted by funding from Canada's Drug Strategy, the Saskatchewan Institute on 
Prevention of Handicaps houses a provincial prevention program for FAS. Recent 
activities in this program have included: a provincial needs assessment; a provincial 
symposium in October 1993; community consultations; and the formation of a provincial 
coordinating committee in March 1993.<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Saskatchewan FAS Coordinating Committee. </B>The committee was 
formed in March 1993. Membership has expanded since its formation, and the committee 
currently includes the following agencies and organizations:

needs assessment involved interviews with key individuals throughout Saskatchewan in 
the areas of health, social services, education, justice and with young women and parents 
of children with FAS. Interviews were conducted with 83 key informants from all parts of 
Saskatchewan. Off -site discussions occurred at six sites in the province.  
<B><LI>Saskatchewan FAS Symposium</B>. The symposium, held in October 1993, 
provided an opportunity for 300 participants to share perspectives and knowledge of FAS. 
Participants represented health, social services, education, justice, Aboriginal groups, 
community groups, and parents. Recommendations from the symposium have been taken 
to the provincial coordinating committee with the goal of developing an action plan to 
address FAS in Saskatchewan. 
<B><LI>Provincial FAS Consultation</B>. A consultation took place in May 1994 to 
address the recommendations from the symposium. Subcommittees in the areas of 
Education, Justice, Health, Parents/Community, and Social Services formed and chose 
priority recommendations from which to develop action plans. These subcommittees 
continue to meet and work independently under the leadership of the Saskatchewan FAS 
Coordinating Committee.
<B><LI>Current Initiatives. </B>Current initiatives of the subcommittees include the 
development of training materials for use by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; plans to

<H2><A NAME = best></A>Best Start:  
Community Action for Healthy Babies</H2>
<H4>Abstract</H4>
Best Start is a population health program aimed at reducing the incidence of low birth 
weight.  Two demonstration sites, the District of Algoma and the City of Barrie, will 
receive funding from the Ministry of Health from 1992 to 1998.  The site coalitions are to 
support and mobilize their communities to promote the health of women and families 
before, during and after pregnancy.  The sites will use community wide health promotion 
approaches to address the range of risk factors associated with low birth weight.  The 
innovations from this program will be shared across Ontario.<P>
Since September 1993 the central administration and resource centre for consultation and 
training for Best Start has been located at the Ontario Prevention Clearinghouse.<P>
<H4>Health Issue</H4>
Low birth weight is an indicator of the health of mothers and babies and therefore the 
health of a community.  Low birth weight infants weigh less than 2500 grams (5.5 lbs).  
They may be premature, or they may be small for gestational age.  Low birth weight 
infants are at risk of dying or developing serious health problems which may last a lifetime.  
Best Start aims to reduce the incidence of low birth weight by effecting changes in risk 
conditions.  Risk factors include behavioural factors such as smoking, environmental ones 
such as workplace conditions, and the larger determinants of health such as poverty.<P>
<H4>Goal and Objectives</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The long term goal is to reduce the rate of low birth weight.
<LI>To promote the health of women and families before, during and after pregnancy.
<LI>To support and mobilize communities to promote the health of women and families.
</UL>
<H4>Approach</H4>
Best Start is a community-wide program the involves the collaboration of community 
agencies, groups, leasers and residents.  Program activities will focus on women, men, 
children, and families in the community and take place in multiple settings.<P>
A variety of health promotion strategies will be used.  Education to change behaviour 
within individuals in a community will be used along with policy and environmental 
support.  A range of risk factors related to low birth weight will be addressed.<P>
The two demonstration sites will test the effectiveness of their strategies.  The central 
evaluation of Best Start is being done by a consulting firm contracted by the Ministry of 
Health.  An evaluation steering committee with representatives from the demonstration 
sites and the central resource centre will coordinate central evaluation activities.  The 
ministry will share information and innovations from this project with communities across 
Ontario.<P>
<H4>Progress to Date</H4>
<H5>A. Demonstration Sites</H5>
The sites have completed the first developmental year and one year of implementation.  
They are now implementing their 994-1995 action plans for intervention.<P>
Algoma Best Start is made up of five coalitions including North Algoma, Sault Ste. Marie, 
the North Shore, the North Shore Tribal Council and Elliot Lake.  Community 
development workers in each of these areas work with a coalition of residents to 
implement program activities.  The central message of Algoma Best Start is "Every Baby 
Deserves a Best Start".  This message is carried out in initiatives that are planned to have a 
positive impact on community attitudes and behaviours.  Interventions are planned to help 
people make healthy choices about food, tobacco, alcohol and drugs.  Adolescents will be 
supported to make healthy lifestyle choices related to pregnancy and parenting.  Each 
initiative will be operated as a pilot in one of the areas, and evaluated before it is carried 
out across the District of Algoma.<P>
Best Start Barrie is organized by eight risk factor categories to direct the focus for change 
towards healthier community models and lifestyles.  The eight initiatives are directed 
towards low birth weight awareness, reproductive health, food for health, tobacco use, 
substance abuse, violence, workplace health and poverty.  In addition to an overall 
population-based strategy the plan emphasizes populations of interest - youth, low 
income, isolated mothers and non-profit tenants associations.  Task forces of community 
volunteers with representation from the steering committee and staff will initiate activities 
across the city of Barrie.<P>

Women's use of alcohol in British Columbia has increased since the 1940's, following 
World War II (Robinson and Elliot). Although specific information on the use of alcohol 
by women in BC is not available, general information related to alcohol sales and 
consumption indicates a high level of alcohol use in BC. In 1994 British Columbians drank 
more heavily than their counterparts in other provinces of Canada.  Only the Yukon and 
the Northwest Territories reported higher levels of alcohol use. In 1991/2, the average 
absolute alcohol intake in BC was 9.35 litres per person 15 years or older. This is 
equivalent to almost 11 1/2  (750 ml) bottles of wine per person per year. The average 
number of drinks consumed per week was 10.6 - this was the highest number of drinks 
consumed per week among  all of  the provinces. Increased drinking behaviour was 
associated with upper middle and high income levels, university and post-secondary 
education, and professional, semi-professional and skilled employment. An estimate of the 
total number of alcoholics in BC is 58,700 or 18 people per 1000. The rate of alcoholism 
increases with age -  24 people per 1000 are estimated as alcoholics in those age 20 years 
or older. This is the third highest rate of alcoholism in Canada (Single, 1995).<P>
In 1993, 68.4% of Canadian women age 15 or older were current drinkers of alcohol (one 
drink or more in the past 12 months, Single, 1995). In the United States, the National 
Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence reported 55% of women aged 18 years and 
over drank moderately (less than 60 drinks per month) and 5% drank heavily (more than 
60 drinks per month). Drinking behaviour differs with the age, life role, and martial status 
of women. In general, a woman's drinking resembles that of her husband, siblings, or close 
friends. Younger women (aged 18-34) report higher levels of drinking-related problems 
than do older women, but the incidence of alcohol dependence is greater among middle-
aged women (aged 35-49) (NIAAA, 1990). Women represented one-third of all 
admissions for treatment to alcohol and drug services in BC last year (1993-'94). Alcohol 
was the primary drug cited for 65% of dependent women accessing treatment. Women in 
their child-bearing years (15 - 44) represented 80% of all admissions by women for 
treatment (Adult Clinical and Addictions Services Branch). Barriers to treatment 
encountered by women include a lack of financial resources, a lack of childcare, the stigma 
of being female and abusing substances, social attitudes towards women and a system of 
care historically designed to meet the needs of alcoholism in men (Women's 
Subcommittee, Alcohol and Drug Programs, BC Ministry of Health). A high priority must 
be given to the treatment of women's addictions and their reproductive health.    <P>
The extent of the problem of FAS/E is underestimated through current health statistics. 
The incidence rate of FAS/E reported on the BC Health Surveillance Registry (BCHSR) is 
low,  due to the Registry's voluntary reporting system, inadequate history taking on 
maternal alcohol use, and the lack of knowledge among health professionals (Loock, 
1990). Wong (1983) reported a FAS incidence rate of 36.8 per 100,000 live births in 
British Columbia between 1959 and 1982. The rate was higher in certain populations - 
Wong reported an incidence of  662.5 per 100,000 live births in the registered native 
population between 1972 - 1980. Robinson, Conry and Conry identified one in five 
children as FAS in a First Nations population in BC. The incidence of FAE is estimated to 
be 5 to 10 times the incidence of FAS. In 1993, live births in BC totalled 45, 989 with an 
estimate of over 1000 infants affected by FAS (92) or FAE (920) [. The approximate 
lifetime costs for health and education for an FAS individual have been estimated to be 1.5 
million dollars. Based on this figure, the 92 FAS babies born in 1993 represent an 
additional lifetime cost of  $138 million. <P>

The Cold Beer and Wine Stores (274) are not regulated through BC Liquor Stores, 
therefore they are not required to participate in the Alcohol Awareness Campaign. The 
Cold Beer and Wine stores are licensed through Liquor Control and Licensing, the 
Ministry of the Attorney General.<P>
<I>Each store will have to be Contacted individually, as the Ministry of the Attorney 
General has no responsibility to request mandatory participation.</I><P>
Private commercial beer and wine brewing facilities do not have to be licensed nor do they 
have to post information about the health hazards of drinking during pregnancy.<P>
<B>b. Targeted Awareness Campaigns - </B> The  targeted awareness campaign, 
<B>Thanks for Caring </B>was undertaken in the fall 1993. 7000 copies of the 
<B>Thanks for Caring</B> promotional calendar and kit were initially distributed 
through health units and pregnancy outreach programs. As of March 1995, 18,000 copies 
of the calendar had been distributed and 89 copies remained in stock with Crown 
Publications.  A second supply of 7000 calendars will be made available in 1995 -'96.<P>

</B><B>i) Bylaws for Warning Signs</B> - Thirty-one (31) or 17% of the 151 
municipalities, and 30 regional districts in British Columbia have independently passed by-
laws requiring warning signs in restaurants, bars and other retail outlets selling alcohol. 
The specific municipalities with bylaws include: Richmond, Vancouver, Burnaby, North 
Okanagan, Kelowna, Vernon and others.<BR>
<BR>
At the annual meeting of the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) in the fall, 1994 a 
resolution was passed for the third time requesting the provincial government to pass 
legislation requiring municipalities to pass bylaws requiring mandatory warning signs 
where alcoholic beverages are sold. No action was taken by the province on this issue.  
The individual municipal governments have to dedicate up to 100 hours for discussion and 
development of individual bylaws.<P>

</I><I></B><B>ii)</I> Warning Sign Participation and Compliance</B> - 
Anecdotal reports from public health inspectors at the various departments of health 
indicate warning signs are posted in restaurants, taverns and bars which are selling 
alcoholic beverages. It is difficult to determine the extent of enforcement which is possible 
with the particular bylaws. Enforcement may vary according to the availability of 
personnel for enforcement (i.e.: are the signs routinely posted? What incentives exist for 
establishments to post signs? What mechanism for enforcement is used?). <P><B>
</B><B>iii) Labelling</B> -  The following countries currently have warning labels on 
alcoholic beverages: Bermuda, Columbia, Mexico and the United States (all states). The 
Yukon and NWT have labels which are added at the liquor stores. The labelling of 
alcoholic beverages was recommended in three of  21 resolutions (Recommendation 5, 6 
and 7) in the 1992 Standing Committee on Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. British Columbia is 
the only province which has shown any commitment to move these recommendations 
forward. The Department of Health and Social Services, PEI (Dr. Sweet) has developed a 
proposal for research related to warning labels and the awareness and knowledge of the 
effects of alcohol on the fetus.  No funding has been secured for Dr. Sweet's research to 
date.<P>
Greenfield (1994) reported an increase of 12% in label awareness in the US, between 
1991 and 1993. 18%  of the public strongly agreed that warning labels were effective and 
the same percentage believed the labels had affected their own drinking. A majority 
believed the measure to be an effective way of changing behaviour (overall 55% and 64%, 
US and Ontario). In the US, public support for the warning label policy rose from 1989 to 
1991(87 -91% favouring) and remained at 91%  in 1993.  Hilton (1991)  indicated in a 
review of literature related to warning labels, that the<B> "awareness that the label 
exists appears to have increased gradually over time". Awareness ... is somewhat 
higher among certain subpopulations, including heavy drinkers, young male drivers, 
and women of child-bearing age"</B>. Hilton also proposed several changes to 
improve the noticeability of the label.<P>

the fetus. The trainer program consists of a 50-page book, and 25-question written 
examination (fee $48.00). The revised program will be introduced in the Fall, 1995.<P>

</I><B>e. Pregnancy Outreach Programs/Services for high-risk pregnant 
women</B><BR><B>
</B>Prevention services are reaching some of the women at highest risk for having a 
FAS/E affected infant. The Pregnancy Outreach Programs(POPs), Healthiest Babies 
Possible and Sheway programs offer prenatal support and health care for high-risk 
women. <P>
Program evaluation for the POPs' indicates a significant reduction in the use of alcohol 
during pregnancy among program participants(858). In 1992/3 almost half (48.5%) of 
program participants reported drinking alcohol prior to their pregnancy. This dropped to 
12% at the time of intake, and to 3% at the last prenatal visit. There were consistent 
decreases between <U>1989/90</U> and <U>1992/93</U> in self-reported alcohol use 
at all three assessment points. Use decreased from an<U> average</U> of nine down to 
seven drinks per week prior to pregnancy, from 2.5 down to 1 drink per week at the time 
of intake,  and from one down to 0.18 at the time of the last prenatal visit.  <P>
There is some variation between the individual POP Programs, and their access to 
treatment services for substance misusing pregnant women. The support for the high-risk 
substance misuser varies, depending on the age of the POP Program, the initiatives for 
program outreach, the community resources available and the outreach workers' and 
program coordinators' training  and experience with substance abuse.<B> Healthiest 
Babies Possible </B>(Prince George) has a drug and alcohol counsellor working in the 
program, who is actively involved in outreach education to high-risk women, including sex 
trade workers and women with alcohol and drug addictions. Other programs refer women 
to appropriate counselling and treatment services(Prince Rupert, Port Alberni), or  provide 
drop-in programs with guest speakers on alcohol and drug issues.<P>
The Sheway Program in the inner city of Vancouver serves approximately 100 women 
each year - all clients are at high-risk for alcohol and drug abuse.  This program is a 
modified POP, providing comprehensive prenatal and postnatal outreach.  Sheway was 
initially funded through a Hospital Community Grant from the MOH.  Additional funds 
from MSS were identified.  Currently another grant (Closer to Home) and donation 
(Chinatown Rotary) will provide funding to renovate adjacent Clinical Space to 
accommodate outreach medical services (nursing, midwifery, prenatal and pediatric care). 
<P>
While the high-risk prenatal outreach programs are providing an effective outreach service 
for high-risk women throughout British Columbia, the programs are unable to provide 
adequate support to a pregnant woman who is a heavy abuser. Women who are heavily 
abusing substances during pregnancy may not have immediate access to detox services and 
may encounter staff unprepared to deal with their addiction if hospitalized.   <P>

<B>a. Alcohol Screening</B> -  The Canadian Periodic Health Examination supports 
the recommendation that screening and counselling be included in all routine health 
examinations of pregnant women (type II evidence).  The<B> T-ACE</B> (or a modified 
version) is used in all Pregnancy Outreach Programs, as well as other prenatal outreach 
services for high-risk women. <P>
The <B>"Alcohol Risk Assessment and Intervention - ARAI"</B> manual was 
developed in collaboration with the College of Family Physicians and Health Canada. The 
chapter on alcohol use in pregnancy is of particular relevance to physicians, although some 
of the information requires clarification. For example, the T-ACE is a more accurate 
screening tool for use with women during pregnancy than the CAGE. The ARAI is not 
used extensively for physician education around alcohol use in British Columbia, and 
additional training is required.  Currently, CAGE, TACE, and AUDIT questionnaires are 
being used.<P>

</B>Alcohol was the primary drug cited for 65% of dependent women accessing 
treatment services in 1993/94.  Women in their child-bearing years (15-44) represented 
80% of all admissions by women for treatment.  Women's addictions and their 
reproductive health must be given greater priority.<P>
<B>Detox Centres</B> - Currently there are no women's detox facilities.  Options for 
institutional and home detox facilities for women are being explored.<P>
<B>Residential Treatment</B> - There are 257 residential treatment beds in BC. Only 
53 (19%) are specifically designated for women.  Waiting lists for women are lengthy (3-4 
months) and there are no treatment centres that will allow women to keep their children.  
Many women will not enter treatment as this means putting their children into 'care" and 
risking not getting them back. As well, 6 weeks in treatment is a long time for a mother 
not to see her children (MacPhee 1992).  The number  of treatment beds at the Aurora 
Centre increased from 12 to 25 in February 1995. An outpatient day program is also 
available and offered to women and day care services are provided.<P>
8 Non-residential treatment programs such as DEW are also available to women.  The 
Dew Program provides more intensive treatment than outpatient services, (ie. 8 hours/day,           
5 days/week for 6 weeks).  The intent is to increase the number of DEW Programs to 20, 
by 1996-1997.  The intensive outpatient treatment provided through DEW has been 
particularly effective with women, and is more cost-effective than residential 
treatment.<P>

funded and not regulated by the provincial government.       <P>
<B>Outpatient services</B> - One hundred and twenty-one (121) alcohol and drug

Programs(IDPs') operating throughout the province. The IDPs provide care to FAS/E 
effected infants.  Although both diagnosed and undiagnosed children are referred to the 
IDPs, the majority of FAS/E  children are undiagnosed. Developmentally delayed (and 
possibly FAS/E affected children) represent 40% of the children in the IDPs.  1994 
provincial statistics indicate the following children were in the various IDP's: 19 FAS 
children, 54 suspected FAS children and 87 NAS children (Brynelson). Although access to 
services may not improve, a diagnosis of  FAS may improve the appropriateness of  
follow-up care and support for the child and family.<P>

</I><B>c. Home support for families of affected children</B> - Children affected by 
FAS/E are over represented in birth families with a past or current history of substance 
abuse, children in foster care and children placed for adoption. FAS/E is probably the most 
common factor in adoption and foster placement breakdowns, and does not seem 
remediable with standard behavioral modification approaches, therapy and good consistent 
care. FAS/E is a likely cause in marginalized women of the inability to parent, avoid 
destructive lifestyles, sustain recovery from addictions, and thus retain or regain 
guardianship of their children. Working and living with children with FAS/E is expensive, 
labour intensive, time consuming, frustrating and exhausting (Berg, et. al. 1995).  <P>
Foster parents, group home workers and child care workers should receive mandatory 
comprehensive training on how to recognize and deal with problems common to children 
in care. For example, FAS/E, NAS, attachment disorders and sexual or physical abuse 
often characterize children in care. A larger number of more skilled caregivers would 
reduce the number of moves for children in care. "Care giving" must be recognized as a 
credible occupation. Payment for services must be increased to attract and keep skilled 
caregivers (Berg, et. al. 1995).  <P>
<B>d. Supported living arrangements for affected youth and adults</B><P><B>
</B>Appropriate placements must be provided for as long as the FAS/E child needs care. 
Currently, required services are cut off once the child has reached the chronological age of 
majority. There are no guidelines for dealing with adolescents with FAS/E. Judges make 
decisions based on the assumption adolescents with FAS/E understand, however they 
often do not. Disciplinary programs should be based on an understanding of the 
neuropsychological and learning problems associated with FAS/E. (Berg, et. al. 1995)<P>
The BC FAS Resource Society Justice Committee has meet with Corrections Canada, to 
review the federal "<B>Living Skills Program for Federal Offenders</B>". Follow-up 
studies with  program participants indicates a 10-20% reduction in recidivism.  <P>

Children with FAS/E may qualify for placement in special education daycares. The extent 
of success in these programs varies with each child. Britannia Community Services Centre 
represents nine inner-city integrated special needs Preschool and Daycare programmes. An 
estimate of 50 -80% of children attending the programmes present characteristics of 
FAS/FAE/NAS. Prevention and intervention services are inadequate to meet current

<B>Statistics on Maternal Alcohol Abuse, Incidence of FAS/E and Infant 
Morbidity/Mortality from Maternal Alcohol Misuse:</B><P><B>
</B>There are a number of databases which are in place which collect data related to 
maternal alcohol abuse, and FAS/E.  The collection and compilation of the data would be 
valuable.<P>
<B>a. British Columbia Data</B><P><B>
</B><B>i) British Columbia Reproductive Care Program (BCRCP) Perinatal 
Database</B> -This database collects data on maternal and perinatal health. The  
<B>BCRCP</B> database collects data on maternal abuse of alcohol on the 
<B>Antenatal Record - Part 1, Section 8 (History of Present Pregnancy)</B> under 
<B>Alcohol/drugs</B>. The <B>T-ACE</B> score is recorded, and the actual T-ACE 
questions appear on the reverse side of the form. <P>
<I><B>Contact: </B></I><BR><B><I>
</B>BCRCP (604) 737-7270. </I><P><I>
</I><B>Limitations</B>: The forms have been used for approximately one year, 
therefore no report has been compiled. Some regions may choose to compile the data 
regionally, but centralized data compilation and analysis is not currently underway through 
BCRCP. A proposal has been developed to establish centralized data analysis through 
BCRCP. <P>
<B>Advantages</B>: In the near future the BCRCP Perinatal Database will be a useful 
source of information for maternal alcohol abuse, including T-ACE scores.<P>
Data collection is standardized throughout the province. All provincial hospitals, as well as 
the federal outpost nursing stations of Medical Services Branch, Health Canada are using 
the BCRCP form.<P><B>
</B><B>ii) Pacific Region, Medical Services Branch, Health Canada </B>(First 
Nations, "on-reserve")<P>

</B><B>ICD-9 Codes</B> - In BC, maternal alcohol abuse is recorded under ICD-9 
Code 648.4, and Code 303 (Alcoholism). Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is recorded under Code 
760.7, Code 779.5 (Drug Withdrawal Syndrome) and Code 655.4.1. There may also be 
some discrepancies in categories used to record maternal alcohol abuse and FAS/E 
between hospitals. <P>

</I><B>BC Health Surveillance Registry</B> (BCHSR) -  Data on FAS/E has been 
collected by the BCHSR since the late 1970s' and early 1980s'. Data is collected from 
diagnostic centres, including Sunny Hill Health Centre and the Physicians' Notice of Birth 
(PNOB) forms. The incidence rate of FAS/E reported on the BCSHR is low. This may be 
due to the Registry's voluntary reporting system, inadequate history taking on maternal 
alcohol use, and the lack of knowledge among health professionals (Loock, 1990).Under 
reporting may also occur due to the short (48- hour) time period in which the form must 
be completed, lack of detection of an immediate problem, and therefore a lack of diagnosis 
of FAS at birth. Maternal alcohol misuse is not currently identified on the BCHSR. <P>

</I><B>c. National Data </B><P><B>
</B><B>i) Health Information, Statistics Canada  - ICD - 9 Codes</B><P><B>
</B>The ICD-9 Code System was introduced in 1979. Since the research on maternal use 
of alcohol and subsequent effects on the fetus and infant were relatively new areas of 
medical science, the system did not include specific codes for recording maternal alcohol 
abuse, and FAS/E in the newborn.<P><B>
</B><B>ii)</B> <B>Non-standardized Use of Codes</B> -  Coding within the ICD-9 
codes is not standardized. For example, Code 760.8 is used by Statistics Canada for 
suspected fetal damage due to maternal alcohol abuse. Vital Statistics,  BC Ministry of 
Health uses code 760.7 for fetal damage due to maternal alcohol abuse. (760 is the 
category for Fetus/Newborn affected by maternal conditions). The lack of a specific code 
for maternal alcohol abuse and  fetal alcohol syndrome/effects results in  discrepancies 
between provinces,  in where information is recorded on the ICD-9 system. This, in turn 
leads to problems with reporting information nationally, and making comparisons between 
provinces.<P><B>
</B><B>iii)</B> <B>Use of Residual Codes for Data Collection</B> - Currently, the 
Health Statistics Division, Statistics Canada classifies suspected damage to the fetus due 
to maternal alcohol abuse in a residual code (Code 760.8) of the ICD-9 codes. Other 
maternal conditions affecting fetal and infant mortality are also listed under this code. For 
example, statistics on the  "suspected damage to the fetus from maternal alcohol addiction; 
listeriosis or toxoplasmosis" are compiled  together. Drug and solvent abuse may also be 
included under code 760.8.  The current use of the ICD-9 classification does not allow 
fetal damage due to maternal alcohol abuse to be specifically identified in the ICD-9 
codes.<P>
Once this data is clearly identified in the ICD-9 codes, it would be an informative addition 
to the <B>1996 Canadian Profile on Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs</B>, as well 
as other national publications.<P>

<H1>FAS/FAE Information Service</H1>
</HEAD><BODY>
<HR>
In 1992, the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse's National Clearinghouse was cited in a 
Parliamentary committee report on fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects as a logical 
location for a national FAS/FAE resource centre. In response to that recommendation, CCSA 
successfully negotiated with three sponsors  Health Canada, the Association of Canadian 
Distillers and the Brewers' Association of Canada  for the creation of an FAS/FAE 
Information Service.<P>
Implemented in April 1994, the service provides links to support groups, prevention projects, 
resource centres and experts on FAS/FAE. It also provides bilingual information on FAS/FAE 
to a variety of clients, including caregivers, educators, social workers, health care and treatment 
professionals, members of the legal community, policy makers and planners, researchers and the 
general public. <P>
A reference desk, staffed by a bilingual information specialist, can be accessed across Canada

<TITLE>FAS/FAE Information Service Evaluation</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>FAS/FAE Information Service</H1>
<H2>Evaluation of Year One</H2>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse launched the FAS/FAE Information Service in May 1994.  The 
goal of the service, which is funded by Health Canada, the Association of Canadian Distillers, the Brewers 
Association of Canada and the CCSA, is to gather and disseminate accurate, timely and thorough 
information on FAS/FAE, in a variety of formats.  The intended stakeholders for the service are parents and 
caregivers of children with FAS or FAE, doctors, nurses and other health care professionals, teachers, 
substance abuse professionals, lawyers, the police and law makers.  Information is provided in both official 
languages through a toll-free line (1-800-559-4514) to an information specialist.  Information is also 
accessible over the Internet on the World Wide Web.<P>
In March 1995, the staff of the service undertook an evaluation of the first year of operation to assess the 
response to the service and to identify any gaps in services and activities.  The evaluation was based on 
usage statistics and a random survey of 100 clients of the service (64 responses).<P>
<H3>Statistics on Usage</H3>
<UL>
<LI>A total of 631 requests were received between May 1994 and February 1995.  The number of requests 
grew steadily each month, from 17 in May to 108 in February.
<LI>All stakeholder groups were represented.  Treatment and health care professionals accounted for the 
greatest number of requests, followed by parents and caregivers, non-government organizations, students 
and educators.
<LI>Requests came from all provinces and territories.  The greatest number of requests came from Ontario, 
followed by British Columbia, Manitoba and Alberta.  A number of international requests were also 
received.  The majority of requests came via the toll-free line
<LI>Clients most frequently requested general FAS/FAE information, followed by information on coping, 
prevention and education.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Survey of Clients</H3>
<UL>
<LI>67% rated the appropriateness of the materials received as being 'excellent' and 33% rated them as 
'good'; 73% felt that the speed with which information was delivered was 'excellent' and 27% rated it as 
'good'
<LI>100% of respondents said they would use the service again
<LI>100% of respondents said they would refer others to the service
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Summary</H3>
The result of the evaluation was very favourable.  In general, the clients of the service have been drawn 
from all anticipated stakeholder groups.  However, the service appears to have been underutilized by two 
groups: the aboriginal community, and researchers.  A special mail-out to the aboriginal community is 
planned for the second year of the service.  It is anticipated that disseminating information via the Internet 
will stimulate use of the service by the research community.  Clients were very satisfied with the quality and 
timeliness of the information provided.  A number of recommendations have emerged from the evaluation, 
including the need for more advertising of the service, and the need for a national speakers list and referral 
service for treatment, prevention, and education.<P>

<TITLE>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome policy discussion paper</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>FETAL ALCOHOL 
SYNDROME:<BR>
AN ISSUE OF CHILD AND FAMILY 
HEALTH</H1>
<H4>A Policy Discussion Paper</H4>
<B>Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA) National Working Group on 
Policy</B><P><B>
</B>This policy discussion document was prepared by the CCSA National Working Group on Policy, 
consisting of Peter Conley, David Hewitt, Wayne Mitic, Diane Riley, Robin Room, Ed Sawka, Eric Single 
(chair) and John Topp.  The views expressed in this document do not necessarily reflect those of the 
organizations to which members of the National Working Group belong. The Working Group gratefully 
acknowledges those persons who have given their time and expertise to comment on earlier drafts of this 
paper. This statement was approved by the CCSA Board of Directors on September 19, 1994.<P>
<HR>
<H3>A.  Background</H3>
<H5>1.  Context</H5>
It has been widely demonstrated that there are significant adverse health effects associated with 
excessive alcohol consumption. Of particular recent concern are the effects of maternal and 
paternal alcohol consumption on the development and overall health of the fetus and the child. A 
variety of studies support the conclusion that heavy maternal drinking is a necessary causal factor 
in "fetal alcohol syndrome" (FAS). However, whether an individual child will have FAS appears to 
depend on a number of factors in addition to alcohol, including parental health, other drug use,  
lifestyle and other socio-economic factors. Therefore, FAS cannot and should not be considered in 
isolation from total concern for the health and well-being of children and their families.<P>
It has been widely demonstrated that there are significant adverse health effects associated with 
excessive alcohol consumption. Of particular recent concern are the effects of maternal and 
paternal alcohol consumption on the development and overall health of the fetus and the child. A 
variety of studies support the conclusion that heavy maternal drinking is a necessary causal factor 
in "fetal alcohol syndrome" (FAS). However, whether an individual child will have FAS appears to 
depend on a number of factors in addition to alcohol, including parental health, other drug use, 
lifestyle and other socio-economic factors. Therefore, FAS cannot and should not be considered in 
isolation from total concern for the health and well-being of children and their families.<P>
<H5>2.  Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) - Definition</H5>
FAS is a cluster of abnormalities occurring in children born of women having histories of relatively 
high levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. A diagnosis of FAS can only be made when 
signs of abnormality exist in each of the following categories. These criteria were developed for 
infants and may not always be appropriate for other age groups.<P>
a)  Growth retardation (prenatal and/or postnatal)<P>
<UL>
<LI>weight or length below the 10th percentile when corrected for gestational age
</UL>
b)  Central nervous system involvement<P>
<UL>
<LI>neurological abnormality (e.g. hearing disorders)
<LI>developmental delay
<LI>behavioral dysfunction or deficit
<LI>intellectual impairment (e.g. learning disability<I>, </I>mental retardation) and/or structural 
abnormalities (e.g. brain malformations).
</UL>
c)  Characteristic face<P>
<UL>
<LI>narrow eye openings<I> </I>(short palpebral fissures)
<LI>elongated, flattened midface
<LI>thin upper lip
<LI>underdeveloped groove (philtrum) between the upper lip and the nose.
</UL>
In addition to the pattern of abnormalities defining FAS, a number of individual features, often 
called Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) have been associated with drinking during pregnancy. FAE is 
not necessarily a milder form of FAS because the signs -- though fewer in number -- may be just 
as severe as in FAS. Examples of these include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>learning problems (learning disabilities and/or mental retardation)
<LI>behavioral problems (motor dysfunction, attention deficient disorder, hyperactivity, sleep disorder)
<LI>hearing defects
<LI>isolated birth defects
</UL>
However, to date there is no universally accepted evidence that FAE is a definable entity and it 
would be unwise to apply it as a diagnosis, in part because of the risk of mislabeling. The individual 
symptoms may be found in children completely independent of alcohol consumption by the mother. 
Given these uncertainties, several authorities in the field have cautioned against use of the term 
FAE, and encouraged gaining a better understanding of individual alcohol-related birth defects. 
While this may be true, there is clearly reason to be concerned about potential fetal alcohol effects 
not included within the FAS diagnostic criteria<B><I>.</B></I><P>
<H5>3.  Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) - Incidence</H5>
When considering the incidence of FAS it is important to remember that the estimates may be 
influenced by a number of factors.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Diagnosis is difficult. Recognizing the facial features associated with the syndrome requires 
considerable experience. In addition, some of the features occur normally in different racial groups. 
<LI>Alcohol consumption is difficult to measure accurately at any time and is particularly difficult to 
measure during pregnancy when concerns about the consequences of drinking may lead to significant 
under-reporting of consumption. In addition, there is no consensus on what level, apart from very heavy 
drinking (e.g., five standard drinks or more per day ), or what pattern of drinking (e.g., binge drinking) results 
in damage.
<LI>Some of the individual features of FAS may also result from, or be exacerbated by, a variety of adverse 
influences (e.g., poor nutrition, family violence or substance abuse, mother's history of other health and 
obstetric problems) interacting with alcohol during pregnancy.
</UL>
Because of these factors, estimates of the incidence of FAS are highly varied and controversial. 
One of the most recent estimates puts the rate for the general population at 0.33 cases per 1000 
live births. This estimate is conservative and does not include minority groups such as aboriginals. 
Limited studies of aboriginal populations suggest that their rate may be 10 times higher, or 
more.<P>
<H3>B.  Issues</H3>
<H5>1.  Unintended Harm</H5>
The current evidence supports the conclusion that women who drink heavily during pregnancy 
may produce children exhibiting features of FAS. In view of the potential damage to the fetus, 
some health care professionals have advised pregnant women to abstain from drinking. It has, 
however, not been consistently shown that low to moderate levels of maternal alcohol 
consumption (e.g., up to two standard drinks per day) cause harm to the fetus or the child. Despite 
the ambiguity relating to the impact of low alcohol consumption there is a misconception among 
some health care practitioners, social service providers, and many members of the general public 
that FAS and individual abnormalities are inevitable even at low levels of consumption.<P>
This perception can result in a number of undesirable outcomes including:<P>
<UL>
<LI>labeling children incorrectly, leaving them with a life-long stigma.
<LI>causing parents to feel guilt that drinking small amounts of alcoholic beverages caused anomalies that 
were actually due to other factors.
<LI>causing undue anxiety in pregnant women and their families.
<LI>decreasing the credibility of information about the other known adverse health effects of heavy 
drinking.
<LI>supporting interventions that may be minimally effective, at the expense of programs for groups that 
could benefit from preventive programs and appropriate treatment.
</UL>
On the other hand, there is a need to take appropriate action on FAS. Otherwise there might 
be:<P>
<UL>
<LI>more FAS children born unnecessarily 
<LI>inadequate diagnosis, treatment, and support of FAS children and their families
<LI>missed opportunities for pregnant women with alcohol or other drug problems to access addictions 
treatment.
</UL>
In the absence of a scientifically established threshold of consumption above which there is 
significant risk to the fetus<B><I>, </B></I>service providers are unable to offer consistent, 
valid advice to women and their partners regarding "safe" levels of alcohol consumption. 
Presently, service providers suggest anything from abstinence to "light" drinking, depending on 
their personal views, without being able to reference a scientifically validated continuum of 
drinking and risk of harmful effects. Clients often find this situation less than helpful and, as noted 
above, even the most conservative advice carries the potential of causing unintended harm to the 
mother, child, or family.<P>
Nevertheless, pregnant women, women planning pregnancy and their partners should not exceed 
the drinking limits suggested for all drinkers. If they want to avoid all risks of fetal alcohol effects, 
less drinking is better and none is best.<P>
<H5>2.  A Narrow Focus on Alcohol</H5>
While it is apparent that children who meet the criteria for FAS are born only to those mothers 
who consume alcohol during pregnancy, it is also evident that these mothers are subject to other 
adverse conditions which are major factors in many cases. These include: poor nutrition, poverty, 
tobacco use, illicit drug use, violence, history of obstetric problems, lack of prenatal care, among 
others. Thus, FAS is not simply an issue of alcohol abuse but a complex issue rooted in the 
underlying social and economic conditions which influence all aspects of maternal and child 
health.<P>
<H5>3.  A Narrow Focus on Women</H5>
In many cases of FAS where information on the father is available, the father has been described 
as a heavy drinker or alcohol-dependent. Thus, some of the factors contributing to FAS may be 
male-mediated. This may occur biologically through damage to the sperm, or physically and 
psychologically through violence or other abuse to the mother. In addition, the positive influences 
that males can have on their partners' drinking need to be recognized and encouraged.<P>
<H3>C.  Policy Recommendations</H3>
1.  Fetal Alcohol Syndrome should be addressed as a community health problem that results from 
the interaction of a variety of adverse conditions, including excessive alcohol consumption. Within 
this context, resources should be directed toward pregnancies at high risk of FAS within high risk 
families. In addition, adequate resources should be available to treat children with FAS and to 
provide caring and compassionate support to their families.<P>
2.  Prevention and education programs must provide information that is scientifically valid and 
pragmatic. Care must be taken to ensure that guidance provided with respect to drinking during 
pregnancy does not result in more harm than good.<P>
3.  All health care professionals should receive appropriate and scientifically valid training on 
preventing, diagnosing and treating FAS and other alcohol related birth defects.<P>
4.  Prevention and education programs should be relevant and targeted to prospective fathers and 
other significant persons in addition to mothers.<P>
5.  Research should be undertaken to:<P>
(a)  establish a set or sets of agreed-upon criteria for diagnosis of FAS at all age levels, <P>
(b)  more accurately determine the incidence of FAS and other alcohol-related birth defects in all 
populations, <P>
(c)  determine the relationship between alcohol consumption levels and patterns of use and birth 
defects,<P>
(d)  determine the relationships between alcohol use and other factors affecting fetal and child health,<P>
(e)  determine the most effective programs for the prevention of FAS and other alcohol-related birth defects, 
and <P>
(f)  determine the most effective treatment and support for those diagnosed as having FAS and their 
families.<P>
6.  Addictions professionals should coordinate their efforts regarding FAS with those of service 
providers concerned with prenatal and reproductive care, maternal and child health, and other 
health care professionals. Their intent should be to improve networking and communications 
among service providers and to ensure mutually supportive initiatives  for both women and their 
partners in prevention, treatment and research aimed at the full spectrum of factors affecting 
maternal, fetal and child health.<P>

</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Canadian Employee Assistance 
Programs<BR>
Practice guidelines</H1>
<HR>
<H2>1. Statement of Principle/Preamble</H2>
The promotion of the physical and emotional well-being of working people in Canada is a 
goal of all employers, unions and government. Such well-being enhances the quality of life 
to all Canadians, as well as promoting productivity and economic growth.<P>
For many reasons, employees may at times require varying degrees of assistance to deal 
with difficulties which may affect their work performance. In accordance with practices 
unique to individual organizations across Canada, employers and groups representing 
employees acknowledge their dual responsibility to furnish reasonable workplace 
assistance.<P>
All parties agree that Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) are a structured, confidential 
and neutral program by which employees seeking help, assistance and direction may, as 
required receive assessment, counselling and referral to those services that will be of 
assistance. The employee may use these services on a voluntary basis.<P>
<H2>2. Definition of Terms</H2>
<B>EMPLOYER</B>- a private or public sector organization which produces goods 
and services to the public.<P>
<B>EMPLOYEE</B> - an individual who is eligible to receive EAP services.<P>
<B>GROUPS REPRESENTING EMPLOYEES/UNION</B>- this includes organized 
labour and other workplace groups or associations representing employees.<P>
<B>EAP PRACTITIONER</B> - may include one or more of the following 
functions:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Administrator or Co-ordinator of Programs: refers to persons executing tasks related 
to the administration or the co-ordination of an EAP.
<LI>Referral Agents: individuals who receive the client, orient toward an appropriate 
resource and assure the follow-up.
<LI>Professional Counsellor: professional who offers services and is accredited by their 
respective professional body.
</OL>
<B>ANONYMITY/CONFIDENTIALITY</B>- need definition<P>
<H2>3. Objectives</H2>
In order to give voice to these principles and to establish effective EAPs, specific 
standards are adopted, based on the following broad objectives:<P>
<H3>3.1 Policy</H3>
An EAP must establish a clear, written policy. To ensure that the program responds to 
employees' needs and reflects the organization's culture, the EAP policy should, as much 
as possible, be developed jointly by representatives of management, labour and groups 
representing employees.<P>
Policy must contain the following elements:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the objectives of an EAP
<LI>the definition of eligible employees
<LI>the types of services offered 
<LI>the qualifications of the EAP practitioners 
<LI>the roles of the different parties
<LI>the methods of access to the program 
<LI>the evaluation and/or audit procedures
</UL>
The policy establishes the program's approach to anonymity and confidentiality. Should 
the employee wish to release information to a third party, procedures for informed, 
voluntary and written consent should be described. In addition, the policy must specify 
mechanisms to ensure the continuity of services for employees affected by the closure, the 
sale, the fusion of a company and the change of a counsellor or of the EAP provider. The 
policy must describe procedures necessary to receive and resolve complaints.<P>
Procedures must be developed to ensure that services are delivered in a confidential 
manner, respecting the anonymity of the employee. Exceptions shall be based on statutory 
requirements.<P>
<H3>3.2 Communication</H3>
The provisions of the EAP policy and program must be communicated to all individuals 
eligible to receive service, according to the methods available to the program. Written 
documentation describing the program must be distributed to all employees.<P>
<H3>3.3 Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)</H3>
<B>Statement of Ethics:</B><P><B>
</B>A participating EAP must ensure that its practitioners abide by the following 
guidelines:<P>
<OL>
<LI>No actual or perceived conflict of interest exists;
<LI>Counsellors or external service providers may not refer clients on the basis of 
personal gain - financial or otherwise;
<LI>Practitioners not engage in any sexual conduct with clients, families or significant 
others,
<LI>Practitioners not harass or intimidate any client on the basis of sex, race, colour, 
national or ethnic origin, religion, disability, pardoned conviction, social situation, marital 
of family status, or on the basis of sexual orientation;
<LI>Procedures are put in place to investigate and resolve, by neutral third parties in any 
complaint of harassment, intimidation or improper or unethical conduct by practitioners. 
Such procedures shall include a dispute resolution process; and
<LI>Practitioners cannot provide services in those areas for which they have not 
background/experience .
</OL>
<B>EAP Practitioners:</B><P><B>
</B><B>EAP ADMINISTRATOR/CO-ORDINATOR</B> - the EAP 
Administrator/Co-ordinator needs to have sufficient knowledge about the intervention 
techniques or be able to acquire the training to gain such knowledge according to the 
standards and practices in the EAP field.<P>
<B>REFERRAL AGENTS</B> - these persons need to have training, skills and 
corresponding expertise that would allow them to make initial evaluation, follow-up or 
referral in the appropriate fields.<P>
<B>COUNSELLORS -</B> qualified EAP counsellors must be members in good 
standing in professional associations or in provincial professional associations which serve 
professionals whose purpose is to provide assistance to employees who may experience 
problems of all sorts.<P>
<B>CODE OF ETHICS</B> - counsellors must abide by the Code of Ethics of their 
professional association corporation. This code takes precedence over any other internal 
code or procedures that the company/organization has developed.<P>
<H3>3.4 Administration of the EAP &amp  Roles of the 
Different Parties</H3>
The EAP must be administered according to good solid business principles.<P>
<B>EAP ELIGIBILITY</B> - The employer, or in some cases, the union and/or the 
Joint EAP Committee, will define the eligibility criteria for the EAP; that is, the eligibility 
of the employees themselves, members of their family and/or retirees. The employer will 
designate an administrator of the EAP to assure the operation of the program. The 
administrator is a member of the EAP Committee, where one exists.<P>
<B>GROUPS REPRESENTING EMPLOYEES</B> - Groups representing 
employees must ensure that all their eligible members receive sufficient information to be 
in a position to use the EAP. They have to also ensure that their new members receive 
appropriate information.<P>
They must also encourage their members to use the EAP in those situations where it may 
be appropriate. Employee groups can also delegate certain responsibilities to their 
representatives. They have to also ensure that they receive the appropriate training. When 
appropriate they will delegate a representative to the EAP Committee.<P>
<B>EAP COMMITTEE</B> - Where they exist, EAP Committees are formed of 
representatives of management and employee groups. The EAP counsellor or 
representative of the firm that provides EAP services can also participate.<P>
The EAP Committee collaborates in the organization of activities of information, training 
and promotion which the purpose is to encourage the employees to utilize the EAP 
service. The Committee furnishes an annual report of its activities to the appropriate 
company representative(s).<P>
<B>THE PRACTITIONER</B>- The EAP Practitioner who delivers EAP services 
must submit periodic reports of activities, according to the standards of the EAP 
Agreement that it has with the company, either to the administrator or to the EAP 
Committee. Practitioners who give services for problems of alcohol and other substance 
abuse problems must have received specialized training and have the necessary experience. 
A thorough broad-based assessment must be conducted for each EAP case as well as 
follow-up.<P>
When the practitioner cannot assist the employee to resolve his problem alone, the 
employee will be oriented towards a professional or other appropriate resource which has 
been screened and evaluated. The practitioner or the EAP provider must assure that the 
external resources conform to acceptable norms of competence and professional 
ethics.<P>
<B>THE EMPLOYEE</B> - The employee who requires EAP services, does so on a 
voluntary basis.<P>
The employee's colleagues, members of his family, supervisors, employee group 
representatives or others can suggest to the employee that they may wish to use the EAP. 
Notwithstanding, the employee is always free to choose to follow these suggestions.<P>
The employee is actively involved in the planning and counselling process, and no decision 
is taken without his understanding and agreement.<P>
<B>THE EAP POLICY</B> - An EAP policy for the specific EAP should specify and 
communicate the role of the EAP practitioner, their minimum training and their EAP 
practice limits.<P>
<H2>4. EAP Characteristics</H2>
<H3>4.1 Anonymity and Confidentiality</H3>
The anonymity of clients, the confidentiality of interviews, the maintenance, transfer and 
destruction of files are subject to the appropriate federal and provincial laws which define 
the conduct of counsellors. Anonymity and confidentiality are limited according to the 
existing laws which are already in effect, however, not where it disturbs the basic tenant of 
confidentiality.<P>
Confidentiality is the cornerstone of an effective EAP. As such, information may be 
released by the counsellor only in situations where the client has provided signed and 
informed consent specifying the information to be released and the person(s) to whom it 
may be released. Confidentiality applies to the client name, the concerns they may have, 
the agency to which they have been referred, and the treatment and help that they 
require.<P>
<H3>4.2 Neutrality</H3>
The EAP must be administered completely independent of other programs within an 
organization. The EAP cannot, in any situation, replace or supersede any other 
administrative or disciplinary measures of the organization, including in the case of drug 
testing. The EAP will not be involved in arbitration.<P>
<H3>4.3 Accessibility</H3>
Offices must be situated in locations that are easy to access, organized in a way to protect 
the anonymity of users and must be accessible to handicapped persons. The hours of 
operation must be flexible enough to the needs of the handicapped employee.<P>
<H3>4.4 Language</H3>
The services of the EAP must be offered in one or other of the two official languages, 
according to the wishes of the employee. When the numbers are justified and the resources 
available, the services must be offered in another language. In the case of disabled persons, 
an effort must be made to offer the services in alternate media.<P>
<H3>4.5 Anti-Discrimination</H3>
A participating EAP must ensure that:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the program is delivered in a non-discriminatory manner in conformity with the 
appropriate human rights legislation regulating the organization;
<LI>the program takes into account the diversities of the Canadian workplace by 
providing cross-cultural ethnic sensitivity training to service providers; and
<LI>the dignity of the client be respected. Specifically, that the client be actively involved 
in his or her referral and/or treatment and that no decisions be taken for the client without 
their understanding and consent.
</UL>
<H3>4.6 Supervision</H3>
Every EAP practitioner who provides client services shall receive consultation and/or 
supervision on a regular basis.<P>
Whether providing assessment, counselling, interviewing or any other sort of client 
service, EAP professionals have a potentially profound effect on their clients. As in other 
professional fields, consultation and supervision are a means to protect the clients' 
interests, to assure the quality of client services and to improve the EAP professional's 
skills. Consultation and supervision help reduce isolation and professional burnout.<P>

<I>   Discovered possession, use or being under the influence of alcohol or an illicit

   Note:  The discussion does not include the possession or use of a licit drug.  Possession 
of such is not a crime and use is often prescribed or recommended by a physician.  
Nevertheless, employers may soon have to begin paying attention to licit drugs since their 
use is much more pervasive than, and their effects are often as great as, illicit drugs:

us inaccurate and irrelevant information and undermines the trust of the good 
employees who resent being ordered to pee in a bottle when they've done nothing 
wrong.  Or, we can take the time to learn about our employees, watch their job 
performance, and help them when it starts to slip.  It's time-consuming, difficult, 
and expensive.  But it works.  Not just in preventing workplace drug abuse, but in 
creating a committed and productive workplace.<P>

<H4>Considerations for a Testing Policy or <I>ad hoc</I> 
Testing</H4>
A unionized employer should try to incorporate the policy, or the right to implement a 
policy, in the collective agreement and a non-unionized employer should provide for 
testing in its employment contracts.  In either case, where safety is a concern and 
employee failure due to impairment could create a safety hazard, an employer should make 
such a requirement a condition of employment.<P>
Where there is no such provision the employer must gain the consent of the employee to 
submit to drug testing.<P>
The employer may be able to require certain employees to submit to drug testing where 
there is evidence of substance abuse which is affecting job performance or compromising 
the safety of other employees or the public.  However, the employer will have to show 
that there are no other less intrusive means of effectively addressing the situation.<P>
An employer may not initiate drug testing where such testing discriminates against 
employees with a disability unless freedom from impairment is a <I>bona fide</I> 
occupational requirement.  <P>
To establish a BFOR, the employer must have evidence of a substance abuse problem in 
the workplace, that there is sufficient risk of employee failure, that drug testing is the best 
means to tackle the problem and that freedom from impairment is necessary for the safe, 
efficient performance of the job.<P>
If the employer cannot establish a BFOR, drug testing will be held to be discriminatory 
unless the employer can show that it accommodated any adversely affected employees to 
the point of undue hardship (e.g., by providing and facilitating rehabilitation and allowing 
enough time for the employee to tackle his or her dependence).<P>
Urinalysis as the means of drug testing may be considered intrusive unless there is clear 
evidence of a substance abuse problem and the employer can establish that there is no 
other means to effectively tackle the problem.<P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
The purpose of this presentation is to address some of the issues faced by employers in 
investigating matters of substance abuse, deciding on the appropriate response and 
preparing for and arguing the arbitration case that can result.<P>
To properly understand what must be done, it is necessary to review the responsibility of 
an employer in these matters and review a current issue of legal controversy - whether an 
employee's post dismissal rehabilitation can be considered by a grievance arbitrator.<P>
<H3><A NAME = employer></A>1. The Employer's 
Responsibility</H3>
<B>Issue</B>:   How must the employer respond to employee behaviour suspected to be 
influenced by substance abuse?<P>
Recent years have seen a very high degree of responsibility imposed on employers dealing 
with employee substance abuse.  This growth of responsibility has been fuelled by:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the seriousness of all substance abuse allegations
<LI>recognition of substance abuse as a disease
<LI>declining recognition of culpable conduct apart from the disease.
</UL>
This responsibility is well illustrated by the case of:<P>
<I>   <U>Westar Timber Ltd.</U> (July 26, 1991; Hickling)</I><P><I>
</I><I>grievor reported to work under the influence</I><BR><I>
extensive disciplinary record for tardiness, some for reporting for work under the 
influence of alcohol and some for poor performance, perhaps related to 
alcoholism</I><BR><I>
only punitive measures taken from 1983 to 1990 were four verbal warnings, a couple of 
written warnings and a one day suspension</I><BR><I>
a number of attempts at corrective action and several counselling sessions that resulted 
in notes to personnel file</I><BR><I>
grievor disputed Employer's right to raise issue of alcoholism</I><BR><I>
reinstated without backpay on condition of completing course of treatment</I><P><I>
</I><B>   Held:</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>any party to an arbitration can raise the question of whether the grievor is an 
alcoholic
<LI>culpable/non-culpable distinction neither appropriate nor helpful
<LI>the employer should provide "a progressive escalating response", or "constructive 
confrontation by degrees" leading to a "crisis precipitation" i.e. the employee knows his 
job is on the line
<LI>treat alcoholism as a chronic disease of which denial is the hallmark
<LI>focus on rehabilitation potential
<LI>consider post-dismissal events as relevant to rehabilitation potential
</UL>
<P>
The same attitude prevails in the federal jurisdiction:<P>
<I>   <U>Canada Post Corp</U>. (1992), 27 L.A.C. (4th) 440 (Picher)</I><P><I>
</I><I>grievor letter carrier failed to deliver the mail</I><BR><I>
behaviour found to have resulted from alcoholism and emotional problems</I><BR><I>
grievor reinstated without compensation subject to continued participation in 
rehabilitation programme</I><P><I>
</I>"[The grievor's conduct was] more consistent with a pattern of irrational 
indifference and not caring, than with any conscious and calculated wrongdoing on 
her part.  Viewed outwardly, her actions are more readily understood as those of a 
person whose judgment and capacity for responsibility are distorted rather than the 
actions of a person who is motivated solely by self interest".  (at p. 446)<P>
Employers can no longer deal in a disciplinary manner with employee problems when there 
are grounds for suspecting a substance abuse problem.  In short, employers cannot treat 
the symptoms and ignore the disease.<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME = investigation></A>2.  The 
Investigation</H3>
<B>Issue</B>:   What are the duties of employers in investigating suspected substance 
abuse and how might those duties affect the rights of employers when dealing with 
substance abuse by employees?<P>
In all disciplinary matters, employers need to be concerned about whether they are 
required to involve union officers or the shop steward in the investigation or to give the 
employee notice of his or her right to representation at certain stages in the process.  If the 
collective agreement contains such a requirement, employers should ensure careful 
compliance; otherwise, all disciplinary action may be void.<P>
Such requirements can impose significant constraints on employer action which can be 
critical, especially in situations of substance abuse at work with potential or actual 
impairment.  Fortunately, employers are not completely handcuffed as shown by this 
summary of the law in <I>Brown and Beatty</I>:<P>
Ultimately, whether failure to provide an employee with a fair and impartial hearing, or 
with union representation before certain named company officials in accordance with the 
collective agreement, will impugn the propriety of any disciplinary sanction, will depend 
on the terms of the agreement.  In this regard, in the more recent cases, arbitrators seem to 
invoke a more purposeful analysis, inquiring into the purpose and importance of the 
obligation rather than focusing on whether the word "shall" was used or whether the 
consequences of non-compliance were expressly described in the agreement.  Within this 
framework many arbitrators have tended to construe provisions which call for the 
attendance of union representatives at disciplinary meetings, where employees are either 
confronted with allegations of misconduct or notified of the imposition of some 
disciplinary penalty, as being substantive and mandatory in nature.  By contrast, where an 
employer is able to show that it had compelling reasons not to comply with some 
requirement to provide notice or impose discipline within a specified time and no prejudice 
was occasioned to the grievors, non-compliance would not likely vitiate any discipline that 
was eventually imposed. (at 7:3560, p. 7-125)<P>
Even in the absence of such a requirement, employers are well advised, where practical, to 
provide every opportunity for the employee to have representation and support when 
disciplinary action for substance abuse is under consideration.  There are several reasons 
for this:<P>
<UL>
<LI>criminal nature of much substance abuse at the workplace
<LI>the stigma of the allegation
<LI>the responsibility to consider the possibility of addiction and to respond 
appropriately.
</UL>
<P>
Incidents of what I call acute abuse - <I>the discovered possession, use or being under 
the influence of alcohol or an illicit drug at the workplace or during working hours</I> - 
presents employers with the most pressing and urgent challenge.  In any safety sensitive 
situation, employers simply cannot take the risk of not acting quickly when there is 
suspected use or impairment.   The appropriate response in such cases is to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>identify and eliminate immediate risks
<LI>remove the person from machinery, equipment, production
<UL>
<LI>minimize disruption and embarrassment
<LI>suspension with pay?
</UL>
<LI>investigate
<UL>
<LI>gather third party and objective evidence quickly and quietly
<LI>union involvement required?
</UL>
<LI>determine scope of problem
<UL>
<LI>others involved/affected?
<LI>symptom of larger problem?
</UL>
<LI>confront the employee with the evidence and offer a chance for an explanation.
</UL>
<P>
In conducting the investigation, employers must keep in mind all the elements of the 
alleged offence.  Consider this example:<P>
<UL>
<LI>it is reported by a supervisor that an employee was seen taking a drink from a flask 
while on shift
<LI>the employee works in a safety sensitive position
<LI>the employer detects the smell of alcohol on his breath but there is no obvious sign of 
impairment
<LI>the employee is sent home without pay for the balance of the day
<LI>the employee knows that any consumption of alcohol at work is prohibited
</UL>
<P>
To justify what amounts to a half day suspension, the employer will have to establish:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the employee actually took a drink
<LI>the drink was alcoholic.
</UL>
<P>
The employer can anticipate being challenged on several questions:<P>
<UL>
<LI>did anyone else see the incident
<LI>how good was the supervisor's view
<LI>was the top of the flask on or off
<LI>did the flask contain anything
<LI>if so, what did the flask contain
<LI>what did the employee's breath smell like
<LI>how can the employer distinguish the smell of alcohol from other substances (like a 
mouthwash)
<LI>generally, on what evidence can a suspension be justified?
</UL>
<P>
Each incident will present its own evidentiary challenges.  Before an employer can 
confidently impose discipline it must be satisfied that there is no reasonable explanation to 
contradict the allegation.  That will require careful consideration of the elements of the 
offence and all possible explanations.  It will also require the comprehensive collection of 
evidence to prove the elements and eliminate the possibility of an innocent 
explanation.<P>
As explained by <I>Brown and Beatty</I> with regards to cases of suspected impairment 
at work:<P>
... if the arbitrator is uncertain as to which version of facts to accept, the indecision 
should be resolved in the grievor's favour.  For example, where, after all the 
evidence had been adduced, the arbitrator was unable to attribute the cause of 
impairment to alcohol rather than to an illness or medication, the discipline 
imposed was not sustained.<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME = response></A>3.  The Response</H3>
<B>Issue</B>:   What is the appropriate response to different forms of substance 
abuse?<P>
Having determined that an offence has occurred, the employer must then respond 
appropriately.<P>
As noted above, the first question is whether the offence under consideration is:<P>
<UL>
<LI>culpable conduct which can be dealt with in the ordinary course of progressive 
discipline?
</UL>
or<P>
<UL>
<LI>a symptom of addiction?
</UL>
In many cases, seemingly unconnected conduct, such as poor performance, 
insubordination, bickering with a fellow worker, is the first workplace manifestation of 
addiction.  At the same time, a flagrant offence such as use of an illicit drug or alcohol at 
work, may be culpable conduct which has nothing to do with addiction.<P>
In the former cases, employers are called to be ever more sensitive to the potential 
problem; in the latter cases employers may have to maintain a degree of scepticism.<P>
One answer to the potential dilemma is to consistently counsel employees about 
workplace issues in such a way that they are encouraged to openly deal with any addiction 
or to seek assistance from another source.<P>
Even for the employee with a problem that has no apparent connection to addiction, there 
is no risk of a quiet word from the employer which directly or indirectly asks if there is 
some problem outside of work that is affecting their performance.  Such inquiries are all 
the more effective if there is a well publicized and effective Employee Assistance 
Programme or if the employer can state its willingness to help as it can through referrals, 
leaves etc.<P>
If the employer is satisfied that there is no underlying problem of addiction, it must then 
decide on an appropriate response to the offence.  Not only must the employer establish 
conduct that calls for some discipline, it must also justify the amount of discipline 
imposed.<P>
Apart from the usual issues of progressive discipline and the need for a proportionate 
response, cases of substance abuse will often require attention to other details:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the existence and consistency of application of policies 
<LI>safety concerns
<LI>applicable laws and regulations
<LI>nature of the business
<LI>business reputation
<LI>public interest concerns.
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME = employee></A>4.  The Employee's 
Rehabilitation</H3>
<B>Issue</B>:   Can the addicted grievor rely on evidence of post dismissal rehabilitation 
to justify reinstatement to employment?<P>
The increasingly stringent requirement on employers to treat suspected cases of addiction 
as a disease and not as culpable conduct worthy of discipline has led many arbitrators to 
go a further step:  to admit evidence of the grievor's rehabilitation <I>after</I> dismissal 
and to use that evidence as the basis for an order of reinstatement.<P>
For example:<P>
<I>   <U>Air Canada</U> (1992), 33 L.A.C. (4th) 241 (Simmons)</I><P><I>
</I><I>23 year employee with good record</I><BR><I>
alcoholic incidents</I><BR><I>
grievor suffered from depressive disorders</I><BR><I>
the employer had embarked on a progressive discipline program</I><BR><I>
after dismissal, the grievor had shown commitment, had successfully concluded 
counselling and had entered into another recommended program</I><BR><I>
evidence of post-dismissal conduct admissible</I><BR><I>
grievor reinstated with conditions</I><P><I>
</I><P>
<I>   <U>Canadian Forest Products</U> (1992), 32 L.A.C. (4th) 110 
(Albertini)</I><P><I>
</I><I>the employer had "more than fulfilled any obligations it had in dealing with a 
problem employee"</I><BR><I>
grievor was in denial about his alcoholism prior to dismissal</I><BR><I>
subsequent to his dismissal the employee had ceased to drink and had enrolled in school 
to upgrade his education</I><BR><I>
the arbitrator also took into consideration that the employee would have difficulty in 
finding another job in a small town with a termination on his employment 
record</I><BR><I>
substituted dismissal with reinstatement to follow fulfilment of certain 
conditions</I><P><I>
</I><P>
<I>   <U>Westmin Resources Ltd.</U> (1994), 46 L.A.C. (4th) 405 
(MacIntyre)</I><P><I>
</I><I>grievor a miner whose job included some vehicle driving</I><BR><I>
caught smoking marijuana during his shift about to drive an explosives vehicle and was 
terminated on the spot</I><BR><I>
following dismissal, grievor started a substance abuse programme</I><BR><I>
there was a lockout at the mine and by the time operations commenced the grievor had 
finished the programme successfully</I><BR><I>
reinstated without backpay with conditions, including an agreement not to report to work 
under the influence of alcohol and non-prescription drugs, registration and compliance 
with the employee assistance plan, spot blood or urine examinations</I><P><I>
</I>With regard to the admissibility of post-discharge evidence, the arbitrator stated:<P>
There is sometimes an argument that an arbitrator should not take into 
consideration post-dismissal events, but that argument is now rarely raised in the 
context of substance abuse.<P>
Westmin appealed to the Labour Relations Board (March 23, 1995, BCLRB No. 
B113/95).  In response to the employer's contention regarding post dismissal evidence, 
Vice-Chair Bruce held:<P>
   ... an arbitrator  is entitled to consider relevant evidence whether or not such 
evidence relates to events occurring  subsequent to the dismissal.  What the 
grievor or the Employer does subsequent to the dismissal, and whether or not it is 
of assistance to their case, is a legitimate concern for the arbitrator.  As the Board 
said in <I>B.C. Central Credit Union</I>, BCLRB No. 299/84: "The future 
conduct of the grievor is an entirely legitimate question for the arbitrator.  
However, such considerations are relevant to the second part of the inquiry by the 
arbitrator:  whether dismissal was an excessive response.  What is required is a 
consideration of objective facts for the purpose of assessing whether there are 
grounds for concluding that the employee ... 'should actually lose his job for the 
offense in question' (<I>William Scott</I> ...)".<P>
In this case, it is apparent the Arbitrator determined the underlying cause of the Grievor's 
problem was an addiction to marijuana.  Rehabilitation evidence is a relevant consideration 
in respect of the second question in <I>William Scott</I>, ... regardless of whether the 
dismissal is based upon culpable or non-culpable grounds.  It remains relevant even though 
the rehabilitation occurred subsequent to the dismissal.  Just as an arbitrator may take into 
account the grievor's failure to address an addiction to marijuana, he or she may also 
consider favourable efforts to eliminate the root cause of the employment offense that led 
to the dismissal.<P>
Even before these recent cases, employers could be forgiven if they thought the tests they 
had to meet were harsh.  But at least if the employer had done everything right, it could be 
assured that its decision to dismiss would not be second-guessed on the basis of evidence 
that was not even in existence at the time of dismissal.  The understood test was best 
illustrated by:<P>
<P>
<I>   Raven Lumber Ltd.</I> (1986), 23 L.A.C. (3d) 357 (Munroe), at p. 365:<P>
Did the employer genuinely treat the employee as being ill and not as being a 
culpable offender?   Did the employer allow a reasonable time for the employee to 
confront and tackle his dependency on alcohol?  Did the employer take all steps 
reasonable in the circumstances to assist the employee in that endeavour?<P>
Where the evidence is such that those questions must be answered in the negative, 
an arbitrator should not be reluctant to render an award based on an up-to-the-
minute judgment about the employee's rehabilitative prospects.  Indeed, in 
appropriate cases, that same lack of reluctance should extend into the future ....  
The objective, in all such cases, is to replicate what should have been done in the 
first place.  The justification for such arbitral activism lies in the employer's failure 
to show that its actions toward the alcoholic employee were just or reasonable - 
i.e., the employer's failure to meet the contractual just-cause standard.<P>
However, suppose that all such questions must be answered in the affirmative.  As 
I have already indicated, that is the only proper answer in the case at hand.  The 
company was confronted with an employee whose alcoholism had long interfered 
with the due performance of his employment obligations.  The company made 
repeated attempts over a number of years to rectify the problem.  When it finally 
moved to sever the relationship, the only possible prognosis was that the situation 
was unlikely to improve.<P>
That being so, how can one conscientiously conclude that the company acted 
unjustly?  Surely a point can be reached where an employer is entitled to an arbitral 
determination of the just-cause issue based on the facts and circumstances as they 
existed at the time the decision to dismiss was made and executed. <P>
It is possible that the pendulum is swinging back to <I>Raven Lumber</I>.  The issue has 
recently been addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in <I>Compagnie miniére 
Quebec Cartier v. United Steel Workers of America, Local 6869: Lippe</I> (1995), 125 
D.L.R. (4th) 577.<P>

</I>Writing for a unanimous Court, L'Heureux-Dubé, J. stated at pp. 582-3:<P>
In my view, an arbitrator can rely on such evidence, but only where it is relevant to the 
issue before him.  In other words, such evidence will only be admissible if it helps to shed 
light on the reasonableness and appropriateness of the dismissal under review at the time 
that it was implemented.  Accordingly, once an arbitrator concludes that a decision by the 
Company to dismiss an employee is justified at the time that it was made, he cannot then 
annul the dismissal on the sole ground that subsequent events render such an annulment, in 
the opinion of the arbitrator, fair and equitable.  In these circumstances, an arbitrator 
would be exceeding his jurisdiction if he relied on subsequent event evidence as grounds 
for annulling the dismissal.  To hold otherwise would be to accept that the result of a 
grievance concerning the dismissal of an employee could vary depending on when it is 
filed and the time lag between the initial filing and the final hearing by the arbitrator.  
Furthermore, it would lead to the absurd conclusion that a decision by the company to 
dismiss an alcoholic employee could be overturned whenever that employee as a result of 
the shock of being dismissed, decides to rehabilitate himself, even if such rehabilitation 
would never have occurred absent the decision to dismiss the employee.  ... There is no 
provision in Quebec labour law or in the collective agreement between the Company and 
the Union which would permit a labour arbitrator to overturn a decision by the Company 
to dismiss an employee notwithstanding the fact that the Company demonstrated just 
cause for the dismissal.<P>
In this respect, I also agree with Gendreau J.A., dissenting at the Court of Appeal, that the 
effect of the arbitrator's decision in the case at hand was to impose an obligation on the 
employer not found in the collective agreement.  Specifically, Gendreau J.A. stated (at p. 
212, translation):  "Accordingly, without saying so expressly, the arbitrator created and 
imposed on the respondent an obligation which it had not accepted and which could be 
stated as follows:  The employer has an obligation to take back an alcoholic employee 
who was dismissed on sufficient grounds and was given every reasonable chance of 
rehabilitation, and who decided upon and undertook, after his departure but before the 
grievance was heard, an alcoholic treatment program which appears at the time the case is 
decided to have been successful.  The formulation of such an obligation for the employer 
and of an equivalent right for the employee is, in my opinion and with the greatest respect, 
adding something to the collective agreement, which grievance arbitrators may not 
do."<P>
The <I>Quebec Cartier</I> decision was distinguished by an arbitrator deciding a case 
under federal law:  <I>Bell Canada</I> (September 22, 1995; Devlin) on the basis that 
section 60(2) of the <I>Canada Labour Code</I> conferred express authority on an 
arbitrator to modify the penalty despite a finding of just cause and that similar powers 
were conferred by the Collective Agreement in issue.<P>
The arbitrator held that in determining whether there was cause for dismissal the 
<I>Code</I> gave her "authority to take account of evidence of events which occurred 
subsequent to the date of dismissal".<P>
On its face the <I>Bell Canada</I> case confines the relevance of the <I>Quebec 
Cartier</I> decision to those arbitrations under the jurisdiction of the <I>Quebec Labour 
Code</I> and where the collective agreement in question contains no clause similar to 
that in <I>Bell Canada</I>.  But the <I>Bell Canada</I> award may itself have limited 
application.<P>
In the first place, one of the reasons for admitting post-dismissal evidence was that 
counsel for the employer submitted that the evidence of the employee's rehabilitative 
efforts after dismissal "should not be determinative in the circumstances where the 
Company made every effort to assist the Grievor to overcome her alcoholism", but did not 
argue that, as a matter of jurisdiction, the arbitrator was precluded from relying on such 
evidence in her consideration of the dismissal.<P>
Second, the arbitrator appears to have been influenced in her decision to admit post 
dismissal evidence by the particular circumstances of the grievor.  Devlin made note of the 
fact that "unresolved issues relating to sexual and physical abuse may well have been at the 
root of [the employee's] alcoholism" and that the evidence also showed that the employee 
"had confronted and addressed those issues and that her prognosis was favourable".<P>
Third, the distinction made by Devlin in <I>Bell Canada</I> between the scope of 
review allowed by the <I>Canada Labour Code</I> and the <I>Quebec Labour 
Code</I> is questionable.  The relevant provision of the <I>QLC</I> gives arbitrators a 
similar jurisdiction to review a dismissal and substitute a lesser penalty to that provided for 
in s. 60(2) of the <I>CLC</I> (supra).  Section 100.12 reads:<P>
In exercise of his duties the arbitrator may<P>
(f)   in disciplinary matters, confirm, amend or set aside the decision of the 
employer and, if such is the case, substitute therefor the decision he deems fair and 
reasonable, taking into account the circumstances concerning the matter.  
However, where the collective agreement provides for a specific sanction for the 
fault alleged against the employee in the case submitted to arbitration, the 
arbitrator shall only confirm or set aside the decision of the employer, or, if such is 
the case, amend it to bring it into conformity with the sanction provided for in the 
collective agreement ...<P>
The argument that the two codes confer a similar scope of review powers is supported by 
the recent dictum of Edwards, J. in <I>Canadian Airlines International Ltd., v. Canadian 
Air Line Pilots Assn.</I> (Unreported) November, 1995, Vancouver Registry No. 
A952273 (B.C.S.C.), where he compares s. 60(2) of the <I>CLC</I> and s. 100.12 (f) of 
the <I>QLC</I>:<P>
The Code provision permits the arbitrator to substitute another penalty even after 
determining a dismissal has been for cause.  The Quebec equivalent is ambiguous.  
On a literal reading it permits the arbitrator to do the same thing, that is, "confirm" 
the employers decision (to dismiss for cause) and yet substitute the decision 
(remedy?) the arbitrator deems fair and reasonable.  The decision in the 
<I>Quebec Cartier</I> case makes it clear that [the] latter interpretation, which 
parallels the Code provision, is not open to permit a finding of cause for dismissal 
and substitution of  reinstatement based on post-dismissal evidence of 
rehabilitation.  By parity of reasoning it would not be open to an arbitrator under 
the Code to find cause existed and use post-dismissal evidence of rehabilitation to 
order reinstatement.<P>
The <I>CAIL</I> decision suggests that the applicability of the <I>Quebec Cartier</I> 
decision is not confined in its relevance to Quebec.  At the very least it is applicable to 
arbitral tribunals in British Columbia dealing with dismissal grievances under the 
<I>Canada Labour Code</I>.<P>
While employers may be spared the consequences of post-dismissal evidence, they cannot 
relax.  <I>Raven Lumber</I> is still an imposing test to meet.  Employers must still make 
every effort to identify and properly deal with substance abuse problems, properly 
distinguishing between truly culpable and non-culpable conduct.<P>
Failure to do so will result in decisions like:<P>
<I>   <U>Alcan Smelters and Chemicals Ltd.</U> (1993), 38 L.A.C. (4th) 110 
(Hope)</I><P><I>
</I><I>evidence of subsequent conduct was admitted and the employee reinstated where 
the employer had not taken sufficient disciplinary initiative which would afford the 
employee an opportunity to address his alcoholism and consequent employment 
deficiencies</I><P><I>
</I><P>
<I>   <U>Tolko Industries Ltd.</U> (June 6, 1995; Keras)</I><P><I>
</I><I>grievor who had worked at the company for less than a year was dismissed for 
being absent without leave</I><P><I>
</I><I>grievor had been arrested for impaired driving and had missed work and was 
later incarcerated for breach of probation</I><P><I>
</I><I>dismissal replaced with reinstatement on conditions</I><P><I>
</I>The arbitrator held that, following the Raven Lumber test, post-dismissal evidence 
was admissible. The grievor was an alcoholic and the company's enquiry into the latter's 
drinking problem "consisted of one and perhaps two cursory attempts".   While the 
arbitrator was reluctant to say that the company should have done more given the 
employee's denial of his problem, it was held that:<P>
The Employer's lack of pro active action, in the circumstances of this case, requires 
the Board to consider post dismissal evidence in the context of no serious 
Employee/Employer efforts having taken place with respect to the Grievor's 
alcoholism.<P>
In this case the post dismissal evidence revealed that the Grievor was incarcerated 
from December 13, 1994 to March 2, 1995 which represented his sentence for 
Impaired Driving, however, the Grievor as at the date of the hearing had no 
outstanding legal problems.<P>
The post dismissal evidence also revealed that the Grievor had quit drinking for 
seven months, was reconciled with his family, and was attending regular AA 
meetings.<P>
The prognosis for regular future attendance is somewhat uncertain, however it is 
more certain than it was at the time of the Grievor's dismissal.<P>
<P>
Contrast those results with:<P>
<I>   <U>Cominco Ltd.</U> (1993), 35 L.A.C. (4th) 430 (Chertkow)</I><P><I>
</I><I>grievor had an extensive record of alcohol-related incidents of 
misconduct</I><BR><I>
employer had required the employee to undergo treatment and suspension of employment 
was to be discontinued with successful completion of the program and fulfilment of 
conditions set out in a letter which specified that any resumption of alcohol in the future 
would result in dismissal from employment</I><BR><I>
after the grievor resumed drinking, the employer advised him of the availability of 
support groups and gave him the name of the employee family assistance plan 
counsellor</I><BR><I>
grievor subsequently reported to work intoxicated</I><BR><I>
grievor discharged and later entered into another residential rehabilitation

it was held that under the Raven Lumber test the employer had fulfilled its legal 
obligations and had "met any and all humanitarian aspects in its dealings with" the 
employee</I><BR><I>
post-dismissal evidence of rehabilitation was not admitted</I><P>

EAPS </TITLE>

<H2>Alcohol and Drug Policy, Drug Testing 
and EAPS</H2>
<H2>Wednesday, December 13, 1995 at 12:00 
noon</H2>
<HR>
<HR>There are a number of reasons why Canadian companies in all industry sectors are 
developing comprehensive alcohol and drug policies, or reviewing and upgrading their 
existing policies (as noted below). This activity is particularly timely in the motor carrier 
industry, and in those companies that have an operational arm to ship their product. With 
Transport Canada no longer proposing legislation, companies can move forward to 
develop policies and programs to meet their own specific needs without being constrained 
by the government's timetable or direction. However, some Canadian carriers may be 
affected by pending U.S. regulations, and need to take this into account when making their 
program decisions.
This paper is intended to assist Canadian companies in understanding the issues they face 
when developing alcohol and drug policies, and to update those that operate into the 
United States on the status of their regulatory activity.<P>
<H3>I.  Why Canadian companies are developing 
policies</H3>
<UL>
<B><LI>Health and Safety Concerns: </B>Drug use and its impact on performance is 
receiving greater attention as information from scientific research, field studies and 
employee opinion increases. Program evaluations are confirming the effectiveness of 
comprehensive policies in triggering a change in attitudes and practices, and reducing the 
negative effects of alcohol and drug use on performance, health, and safety.
<B><LI>Legal Liabilities and Responsibilities: </B>A variety of associated legal 
issues can be addressed through consistent implementation of a clear and reasonable 
policy; this can include addressing the liabilities associated with the actions of impaired 
employees at work, due diligence responsibility around workplace safety, actions in 
response to possession or trafficking of illicit drugs, and the duty to accommodate those 
with a chemical dependency in accordance with human rights provisions.
<B><LI>Government Regulations: </B>The Canadian government has confirmed that 
it will not introduce regulations requiring transportation companies to have substance use 
policies and programs at this time. However, U.S. government regulations will have 
specific implications for Canadian companies with truck and bus services operating cross-
border. A detailed review of the implications of U.S. regulations on Canadian motor 
carriers follows.
<B><LI>Corporate Requirements: </B>Many U.S. parent companies are requesting 
that their Canadian subsidiaries develop alcohol and drug policies. The 1994 American 
Management Association survey found that 87% of major U.S. firms test employees, 
applicants, or both for drug use; they report that the most effective programs combine 
testing with education, supervisor training and access to assistance.
<B><LI>Extension of Existing Programs: </B>Many companies with employee 
assistance programs are recognizing the EAP does not set policy standards around drug 
and alcohol use, nor does it deal with deterrence measures, discipline, contractor 
provisions, hosting guidelines etc. Therefore, many companies are extending existing 
programs through a comprehensive policy.
<B><LI>Contractor Compliance:</B> A number of the larger Canadian companies 
with strong policies expect the same level of diligence around drug and alcohol use as a 
condition of each contract. Their reason - court decisions clarifying occupational health 
and safety responsibilities extend to contracted workers. Therefore, independent of any 
U.S. regulatory requirements, Canadian motor carriers may find they need to introduce 
programs as a condition of doing business in Canada.
</UL>
<H3>II. Specific implications for the motor carrier 
industry</H3>
An overview of the U.S. regulations as they will apply to Canadian carriers follows. 
Companies should not attempt to develop policies strictly based on this overview; there 
are many more details in the regulations themselves, and these should be obtained by 
anyone affected.<P>
<H4>i ) Background</H4>
<I>The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act</I> of 1991 requires alcohol and 
drug testing of safety-sensitive employees<B> </B>in the motor carrier, aviation, railroad 
and mass transit industries, with the goal of deterring and detecting the misuse of alcohol 
and the use of controlled substances.<P>
In response to this Act, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) introduced drug 
and alcohol regulations for the specific industries within its mandate. The Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA) is the DOT agency that governs the motor carrier industry, and 
has implemented these rules on drug and alcohol testing.<P>
<H4>ii) Application</H4>
The FHWA regulations apply to everyone who operates a commercial motor vehicle in the 
United States and is subject to commercial drivers' licence ( CDL ) requirements. The 
regulations became effective for U.S. employers with 50 or more CDL drivers in January 
1995, and will become effective for U.S. employers with 49 or less CDL drivers in January 
1996.<P>
On September 22, 1995, a final regulation was passed confirming that the requirements 
will apply to Canadian CDL drivers operating across the U.S. border on July 1, 1996, 
when they work for a large foreign employer (fifty or more drivers assigned to operate 
commercial motor vehicles in North America as of December 17, 1995). All others must 
implement the requirements on July 1, 1997.<P>
Commercial motor vehicles include those with a gross vehicle rating of 26,001 or more 
pounds, that are designed to transport 16 or more passengers (including the driver) or are 
of any size and placarded for the transportation of hazardous materials.<P>
Any Canadian motor carrier with employees operating cross-border must therefore include 
in their company drug and alcohol policy, provisions for compliance with the U.S. rules. 
For this reason, it is crucial to acquire a clear understanding of these rules, and the 
associated responsibilities for Canadian motor carriers.<P>
<B><H4>iii) </B>Core Standards</H4>
With respect to alcohol, the regulations prohibit possession, on-duty use, use for four 
hours prior to duty, use for eight hours after certain accidents, and having a blood alcohol 
level of 0.02 or greater while on duty.<P>
With respect to drugs, the regulations prohibit possession, use (except where under the 
instruction of a physician and there is no potential for adverse effects), and having any 
banned substances in the body as confirmed by a positive test result.<P>
The consequences for prohibited conduct include immediate removal from duty; if an 
alcohol test result is between 0.02 and 0.039 BAC, off duty for at least 24 hours; if the 
test result is 0.04 or greater or positive for drugs, referral for an evaluation by a Substance 
Abuse Professional (SAP); a negative test result (less than 0.02 for alcohol) is then 
required before return to duty, and follow-up testing on return where recommended by the 
SAP.<P>
<B><H4>iv) </B>Testing Requirements</H4>
Testing for alcohol must be done using evidential breath testing devices by a trained 
technician, and in association with doing their safety sensitive job; testing for other drugs 
(marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates and PCP) must be done at any time when on 
duty, and through urine specimen collection (split samples) and analysis by a certified 
laboratory with qualified medical review of results. Testing will be done:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Pre-employment</B> - ( drug only) for all applicants with certain exceptions 
based on past participation in a testing program;
<LI>with <B>Reasonable Suspicion</B> - of a rule violation, based on specific and 
documented observations of a trained supervisor concerning appearance, behaviour, 
speech or body odours, and/or indicators of chronic and withdrawal effects of drugs;
<LI>within a designated time period <B>After an Accident</B> that involves a fatality, 
or an accident in which either medical assistance is required away from the scene or the 
commercial motor vehicle is disabled and must be towed and the driver has received a 
citation for a moving violation;
<LI>on an unannounced <B>Random</B> basis, at a minimum annual rate of 25% for 
alcohol and 50% for drugs; 
<LI>on <B>Return to Duty </B>after a driver has engaged in prohibited conduct; and
<LI>on an unannounced <B>Follow-up</B> basis for at least a year on return after a 
SAP assessment identifies the need to resolve a problem with alcohol or drug use/misuse.
</UL>
<B><H4>v) </B>Prevention Initiatives</H4>
Drivers must be given a copy of the company policy, and information on available 
resources for the evaluation and treatment of any problems; the carrier is not required to 
pay for treatment or hold a job open for a driver. Supervisors that will make reasonable 
suspicion referrals must receive at least two hours of training.<P>
<B><H4>vi) </B>Employer Responsibility</H4>
No employer with knowledge that a driver has violated the rules can permit the driver to 
perform a safety-sensitive job (e.g. drive a commercial motor vehicle). They must also, 
with the applicant's consent, obtain the testing history from previous employers (past two 
years) to determine if they are qualified to drive.<P>
Employers must prepare and maintain an annual summary of the results of their testing 
program. They will be audited by DOT with respect to compliance with the rules, and 
fined for any infractions.<P>
<H3>III. Industry initiatives</H3>
The various motor carrier industry associations began working together immediately after 
determining that Transport Canada would not be regulating, in an effort to better 
understand the U.S. requirements, their operating implications, and the specific services 
that companies will need in order to meet these requirements. Underlying all of their work 
has been the understanding that the industry must place a priority on health and safety, and 
that this can be achieved through comprehensive programs aimed at preventing any and all 
negative impacts resulting from alcohol or drug use.<P>
The industry also recognizes that solutions will be found in a balance of programs that 
help prevent problems, providing channels to seek assistance for those that need it, as well 
as programs that deter drivers and other employees from use of illicit drugs and the 
irresponsible use of alcohol and medications. This is why policies developed in Canada 
must go beyond simply meeting the regulatory requirements.<P>
A number of initiatives are underway:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Policy Seminars:</B> A series of seminars have been organized and run across 
the country by provincial motor carrier associations; they have been underway since June 
of this year, and will continue into the new year on an 'as needed' basis. The stress is on 
the development of comprehensive policies to meet Canadian-based needs in the Canadian 
legal environment, recognizing that the U.S. regulations are a specific operating 
requirement that must be addressed.
<B><LI>Consortium of Services:</B> The Ontario Trucking Association, with 
agreement of the national and provincial bodies and other affected transportation 
organizations, has been actively developing a consortium of services that members and 
non-members can access as they implement their policies. These include:
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>provision of a Canada-wide employee assistance program;
<LI>provision of supervisor training services, with a core program and qualified delivery;
<LI>development of a catalogue of educational materials for employees;
<LI>ongoing information updates for members, regarding regulatory changes, Canadian 
legal issues and related information on workplace alcohol and drug issues; and
<LI>provision of access to all necessary testing services (third party administration, 
random selection, collection by trained and qualified collectors, analysis by a certified lab, 
qualified medical review of results, record keeping and reporting, and training of company 
program administrators, and information on availability of SAPs).
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
After a comprehensive competitive process, contracts are presently (November) being 
finalized with the main service providers.<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Ongoing Interface with Canadian Governments:</B> Through the Canadian 
Trucking Association and the OTA, there is ongoing work being done to confirm 
acceptance of Canadian laboratories under the program, interpret details of the 
regulations, determine enforcement procedures, and identify further communications 
needs.
</UL>
<H3>IV. Developing company policies</H3>
Whether regulated or not, companies in this industry and others are being encouraged to 
take an enlightened and comprehensive approach to dealing with workplace substance 
abuse issues. There is considerable information now available through studies and 
employee surveys tying substance abuse with increased turnover, accidents, and 
absenteeism, as well as rising compensation, sick benefits and insurance claims. Loss of 
productivity and human potential, low quality products and services, theft and trafficking, 
and a negative impact on corporate culture, morale and image have also been attributed to 
this problem, as has increased corporate liability regarding employee and public safety and 
environmental impacts associated with accidents.<P>
In light of this information, it makes good business sense to develop a company alcohol 
and drug policy - not just for drivers but for all employees. Employers must keep in mind 
their liability for the actions of impaired employees in the course of their work, due 
diligence responsibility around workplace safety, actions in response to possession or 
trafficking, responsibilities with regard to employees with a disability (which can include 
dependency on drugs and alcohol), and collective agreement considerations.<P>
There is no 'typical' anti-substance abuse policy or program; each program reflects the 
unique corporate culture and values of the company, the fundamental aspects of the 
business they are in, the regulatory environment within which they must operate, and most 
important, their specific program needs. However, there are a number of key areas that 
policies must address, and several difficult decisions that will need to be tackled. At their 
core, company policies need to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>be written down and broadly communicated to all employees;
<LI>provide clear direction on the objective, application (people and circumstances) and 
standards that are to be met;
<LI>outline the applicable rules and responsibilities;
<LI>clarify avenues to access assistance and conditions for return to duty; and
<LI>set out consequences for policy violation.
</UL>
In addition, there are four fundamental cornerstones that underlie the various policy 
details:<P>
<UL>
<LI>awareness and education programs;
<LI>access to assistance, often through an internal or external employee assistance 
program;
<LI>supervisor training on their role under the policy; and
<LI>methods to identify those employees with a problem, or those that are in violation of 
the policy.
</UL>
Building on these cornerstones, all policies should be sensitive to employees' rights of 
privacy, confidentiality and dignity in their standards and implementation processes.<P>
In the end, the most difficult decisions involve finding the appropriate balance between 
health and safety (due diligence), and respect for individual privacy; this includes finding a 
balance between measures to control or deter use and prevention measures, while 
recognizing the needs of all stakeholders. Companies need to ensure they keep these 
considerations in mind as they move through a policy development process.<P>

Introduction</H2>
The Department of Transportation (DOT) rules define the Substance Abuse Professional 
(SAP) to be a licensed physician (Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathy), a licensed or 
certified psychologist a licensed or certified social worker, or a licensed or certified 
employee assistance professional. In addition, alcohol and drug abuse counselors certified 
by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors (NAADAC) 
Certification Commission, a national organization that imposes qualification standards for 
treatment of alcohol-related disorders, are included in the SAP definition. All must have 
knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of substance abuse-
related disorders (the degrees and certificates alone do not confer this knowledge). [Also, 
the Department may place additional certification organizations' counselors onto the SAP 
definition at future times. These additions will be based upon those organizations passing a 
rigorous review of their certification programs.]<P>
The DOT has not authorized individuals to be SAPs who meet only State-certification 
criterion because qualifications vary greatly by State. In some States, certified counselors 
do not have the experience or training deemed necessary to implement the objectives of 
the rules. State-certified addiction counselors can, of course, take the NAADAC 
competency examination to receive certification.<P>
The primary safety objective of the DOT rules is to prevent, through deterrence and 
detection, alcohol and controlled substance users from performing transportation safety-
sensitive functions. The SAP is responsible for several duties important to the evaluation, 
referral, and treatment of employees identified through breath and urinalysis testing as 
being positive for alcohol and/or controlled substance use, or who refuse to be tested, or 
who have violated other provisions of the DOT rules.<P>
The SAP's fundamental responsibility is to provide a comprehensive face-to-face 
assessment and clinical evaluation to determine if the employee needs assistance resolving 
problems associated with alcohol use or prohibited drug use. If the employee is found to 
need assistance as a result of this evaluation, the SAP recommends a course of treatment 
with which the employee must demonstrate successful compliance prior to returning to 
DOT safety-sensitive duty. Treatment recommendations can include, but are not limited 
to: In-patient treatment, partial in-patient treatment, out-patient treatment, education 
programs, and aftercare. Upon the determination of the best recommendation for 
assistance, the SAP will serve as a referral source to assist the employee's entry into an 
acceptable treatment or education program.<P>
The SAP shall have a working knowledge of quality programs and qualified counselors as 
well as insurance, benefit plans, and payment requirements. In addition, the SAP, M hen 
possible, should be cognizant of the employer's policies regarding payment for treatment; 
on-duty-time treatment programming; and the granting of administrative, sick, and/or 
annual leave for both in-patient and out- - ^ patient treatment. The SAP will also make 
information available to the employee -regarding meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, 
Narcotics Anonymous, and Al-Anon, as well as other tenable self-help groups.<P>
Prior to the employee's return to safety-sensitive duties, a SAP is required to provide a 
face-to-face follow-up evaluation with the employee to determine if the individual has 
demonstrated successful compliance with recommendations of the initial evaluation. The 
SAP must provide this evaluation before an employer can consider the employee for return 
to safety-sensitive functions. Therefore, the evaluation serves to provide the employer 
with assurance that the employee has made appropriate treatment progress.<P>
The SAP also directs a follow-up testing plan for the employee returning to work 
following treatment. The number and frequency of unannounced follow-up testing is 
directed b&gt « the SAP, and is (as mandated by DOT rules) to consist of at least six tests 
in the first 12 months following the employee's return to safety-sensitive duties. If poly-
substance use has been indicated, the follow-up testing plan may include testing for drugs 
as well as alcohol (for the alcohol rule violator) and for alcohol as well as drugs (for the 
drug rule violator). Follow-up testing can last up to 60 months but can be terminated by 
the SAP following completion of the first six tests that are spread throughout the twelve-
month period. This follow-up testing requirement is in addition to tests accomplished 
through the employer's random testing program.<P>
In directing the follow-up testing plan, the SAP will specify the number and frequency of 
the follow-up tests. The employer would then be responsible for ensuring that an 
individual is tested according to the plan. Follow-up testing is one of the best means that 
the employer has to determine if the employee has stopped using controlled substances or 
misusing alcohol.<P>
<I>It is important to note, that SAPs must be knowledgeable of the appropriate DOT 
Operating Administrations [Federal Highway Administration (FHVEA), Federal 
Railroad Administration (FRA), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA), and Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA)] 
rules governing the employers' implementation of these drug and alcohol testing 
regulations. Differences in the rule requirements exist.</I><P><I>
</I><I>For example, within the scope of the FHRA rule, follow-up testing is not 
authorized following drug or alcohol rule violations if the SAP does not recommend 
treatment. On the other hand, the FRA rule requires follow-up testing following a drug or 
alcohol violation even if treatment is not recommended .</I><P><I>
</I><I>Also, RSPA currently requires an employee to have a SAP evaluation following 
an I alcohol violation but not following a drug violation.</I><P><I>
</I><HR>
<H2><A NAME = sectionII></A>Section II: 
SAP Duties</H2>
<H3><A NAME = evaluation></A>Evaluation:</H3>
Consistent with sound clinical and established SAP standards of care in clinical practice, 
and utilizing reliable alcohol and drug abuse assessment tools, the SAP must conduct a 
face-to-face evaluation of the client. This type session is essential to provide the SAP with 
an opportunity to objectively evaluate the "non-verbals" -- those physical cues to internal 
feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. The SAP should be cognizant of the client's appearance, 
posture, carriage, ability to make eye contact, and ability to relate in-person as well as 
other physical characteristics that would be indicative of alcohol and drug use and abuse. 
Attention should be placed upon the rule violation that brought the employee to the point 
of being required to have the SAP evaluation. Always, the SAP must provide immediate 
attention to individuals who may be in danger to themselves others.<P>
The evaluation should be comprised of a standard psycho-social history; an in-depth drug 
and alcohol use history (with information regarding onset, duration, frequency, and 
amount of use; substance(s) of use and choice; emotional and physical characteristics of 
use; associated health, work, family, personal, and interpersonal problems); and, a current 
mental status. The evaluation should provide a clinical assessment, treatment 
recommendations, and a treatment plan to be successfully complied with prior to the 
employee becoming eligible for follow-up evaluation and subsequent return (if the 
employer desires) to safety-sensitive functions.<P>
Upon a SAP's finding that the employee needs assistance with a drug or alcohol problem, 
the SAP must inform the employer in writing of this decision. This notification should be 
in letter format with the SAP's official letterhead, signed by the SAP, and should contain 
the following:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Employee's name and social security number;
<LI>Employer's name and address;
<LI>Reason for the initial assessment (specific violation of the rules; and date)
<LI>Date of the SAP assessment.
<LI>SAP's treatment recommendation.
<LI>SAP's telephone number.
</OL>
Following the evaluation and upon a finding that the employee needs no assistance with a 
drug or alcohol problem, the SAP must inform the employer in writing of this decision. 
The information should be in letter format with the SAP's official letterhead, signed by the 
SAP, and should contain the following:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Employee's name and social security number.
<LI>Employer's name and address.
<LI>Reason for the initial assessment (specific violation of the rules and date)
<LI>Date of the SAP assessment.
<LI>SAP's reasons determining that the employee needs no assistance in resolving a drug 
or alcohol problem.
<LI>Follow-up testing plan (when Operating Administration rule directs).
<LI>SAP's telephone number.
</OL>
<H3><A NAME = referral></A>Referral:</H3>
Following the evaluation and upon a finding that the employee requires assistance with 
associated drug or alcohol problems, the SAP's referral of the employee to the appropriate 
treatment program is vital. This referral should be consistent with clinically evaluated 
employee needs. The SAP should also take into consideration other stipulations such as 
employee insurance coverage, employee ability to pay for care, employer treatment 
contracts, employer policies regarding availability of leave for employees needing 
assistance, and availability of treatment and education programs.<P>
The SAP should have a working knowledge of quality programs and qualified counselors. 
When a variety of appropriate treatment programs are available within the employee's 
geographical area, the SAP may permit the employee to select the facility or practice from 
a SAP-approved provider list. The SAP should facilitate the referral by making contact 
with the recommended treatment program. It is not necessary for the SAP to make the 
initial appointment for the employee unless the SAP believes it necessary. The SAP should 
transmit, by appropriate means, the treatment plan with assessment determinations to the 
treatment provider.<P>
SAPs are prohibited from referring an employee to certain treatment entities listed in 
Section III of these procedures.<P>
<H3><A NAME = followeval></A><A NAME = 
follow></A>Follow-up evaluation:</H3>
The SAP's evaluation of the employee prior to return to safety-sensitive duties is vital in 
gauging (for the employer) the employee's success in meeting the requirements in the 
initial evaluation's treatment plan. The violation of a DOT drug and alcohol rule has 
caused the employee's ability to perform safety-sensitive duties to be called into question. 
The employee's ability to demonstrate successful compliance with the initial treatment 
recommendations is key to an employer's decision to return an employee to transportation 
safety-sensitive duties. Importantly, the follow-up evaluation is clinically based and should 
provide the employer a concise assessment of the employee's success in fulfilling 
requirements of the treatment plan.<P>
In some cases, the SAP has the latitude to conduct the follow-up evaluation prior to the 
employee's completion of the full range of recommended treatment. The SAP would base 
the determination of whether the employee demonstrates successful compliance with the 
treatment recommendation upon written reports from and personal communication with 
the treatment program professionals as well as a face-to-face interview with the employee. 
Written information from the treatment program would include a treatment progress 
report and/or discharge summary. The personal contact with treatment program 
professionals could be telephonic conversation regarding the nature of the employee's 
progress, prognosis for success, and any other salient factors that could assist the SAP's 
follow-up evaluation. If the treatment program professional believes the individual has not 
made significant progress in treatment, the SAP should not proceed with conducting a 
follow-up interview session with the employee. It is imperative that a SAP focus upon 
more than simply the employee's attendance in the treatment program, but rather upon the 
level of participation in the program and the progress the employee has made in dealing 
with the drug or alcohol problem.<P>
The SAP, furnished with information from the treatment program that the employee has 
made sufficient progress, will meet with the employee to discuss the treatment effort, 
behavioral changes, and plans for continued treatment plan follow through as well as 
return-to-duty and follow-up testing issues. Based upon clinical judgement that the 
employee has made progress sufficient to warrant return to safety-sensitive functions, the 
SAP will provide the employer with a recommendation and a follow-up testing plan.<P>
Or, believing the individual has not demonstrated successful compliance with the treatment 
recommendation, the SAP will postpone the re-evaluation pending the employee's further 
compliance with the treatment plan. With a premium on public safety, an employer is best 
served if the SAP provides an evaluation designed to ascertain if the employee 
demonstrates successful compliance rather than an evaluation that is a cursory 
administrative review.<P>
It is important to note, that no employee should be considered eligible for receiving a 
follow-up evaluation prior to completion of an in-patient or partial in-patient / day-
treatment program. An employee entering this type of program is not to receive a follow-
up evaluation while still participating in that program. Upon program completion, the 
employee can be evaluated prior to subsequent entry into or completion of an after-care 
out-patient treatment program.<P>
The SAP's report outlining the employee's ability to demonstrate successful compliance, to 
the employer should be in letter format with the SAP's official letterhead, signed by the 
SAP, and should contain the following:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Employee's name and social security number.
<LI>Employer's name and address.
<LI>Reason for initial assessment (specific violation of the rules and the violation date).
<LI>Date(s) of initial assessment and brief synopsis of the rehabilitation plan.
<LI>Name of practice or program providing the treatment.
<LI>Inclusive dates of the employee's treatment program.
<LI>Clinical characterization of the employee's participation in the treatment program.
<LI>SAP's clinical determination as to the employee's demonstration of successful 
compliance.
<LI>Follow-up testing plan.
<LI>SAP's telephone number.
</OL>
<H3><A NAME = followtest></A>Follow-up 
testing:</H3>
Follow-up testing serves as more than an employer's additional assurance that an employee 
is performing safety-sensitive work in an alcohol-free and/or drug-free manner. It serves 
the recovering employee as an adjunct to the total and on-going rehabilitation effort. 
Despite the fact that treatment can be short term, the rehabilitation process for the 
recovering alcohol abuser and drug user usually requires long-term effort on the part of 
the employee. Because most relapses occur during the first 12 months following 
treatment, this effort can be enhanced in many ways during this first year (and thereafter) -
- among these are the recovering employee's required participation in follow-up testing 
program as well as participation in aftercare programs and in self-help groups.<P>
Therefore, the SAP must present the employer and the employee a plan for follow-up 
testing. The SAP can re-evaluate the plan at any time and terminate the plan following the 
completion of the six tests during the first year. Testing should be spread throughout the 
year, unpredictable, and unannounced. An employee's follow-up testing program can last 
up to 60 months. The SAP will provide the employer with the recommended number of 
tests and the approximate frequency of the tests (e.g. 4 tests in the first 6 months, and 2 in 
the final six months of the first year). Employers are best suited to arrange for the actual 
tests to be conducted because they are aware of employee performance issues and 
schedule circumstances. This follow-up testing requirement is in addition to tests 
accomplished through the employer's random testing program.<P>
<H3><A NAME = sectionIII></A>Section III: SAP 
prohibitions</H3>
The DOT rules state that the SAP shall not refer an employee requiring assistance to the 
SAP's private practice or to a person or organization from which the SAP receives 
remuneration or to a person or organization in which the SAP has a financial interest. To 
prevent the appearance of a conflict of interest, the intent of the rules is to preclude the 
SAP from making referrals to entities with which the SAP is financially associated (to 
include any in-patient, out-patient, and education organizations or practices). However, 
this requirement could impose hardship upon employer and employees in remote areas or 
in situations where employee assistance is provided by contract or though a health 
insurance program. Therefore, the rules do not prohibit the SAP from referring an 
employee for assistance by:<P>
<OL>
<LI>A public agency, such as a State, county, or municipality;
<LI>The employer or a person under contract to provide treatment for alcohol or drug 
problems on behalf of the employer;
<LI>The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment under the employee's health 
insurance program; or
<LI>The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment reasonably accessible to the 
employee.
</OL>
The intent of these prohibitions is to ensure that the SAP referral in no way is of financial 
benefit to the SAP. And, because the SAP needs to have knowledge of reliable treatment 
resources, the SAP needs to maintain objectivity in the evaluation of what actually 
constitutes a reliable resource.<P>
<H3><A NAME = sectionIV></A>Section IV: Release of 
information</H3>
Imperative to SAP functioning is the ability to receive and communicate pertinent 
information regarding the employee's evaluation and treatment progress. Because much of 
the information is confidential in nature, the SAP needs to obtain from the employee 
specific releases authorizing disclosure of information. These specific releases will permit 
the SAP to:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Give the synopsis of the employee's treatment plan to the employer.
<LI>Provide the assessment evaluation and treatment plan to the counseling t treatment / 
education organization(s) or practice(s).
<LI>Receive diagnostic information, treatment progress reports, and program completion 
information, as well as program involvement dates from counseling / treatment / education 
organization(s) or practice(s)
<LI>Provide the follow-up evaluation synopsis to the employer.
</OL>
[If the employer's Employee Assistance Program serves as the conduit between SAP and 
employer, releases are needed as appropriate.]<P>
The privileged client-counselor relationship has been supported by Federal and State laws 
and rules, codes of ethical standards, and certification and licensing boards by which 
counselors are regulated. Exceptions to confidentiality primarily occur if the client poses a 
clear and imminent danger to self or others, if there is known or suspected child abuse or 
neglect, when medical records are court ordered by a judge compelling disclosure, or 
when the counselor seeks medical or legal consultation. Client record information can also 
be released to DOT for audit and review purposes in accordance with Federal disclosure 
rules.<P>
<H3><A NAME = sectionV></A>Section V: Record 
maintenance</H3>
Records pertaining to a determination by a SAP concerning an employee's need for 
assistance and records concerning an employee's ability to demonstrate successful 
compliance with recommendations of the SAP need to be maintained for a period of five 
years. Records should be maintained in limited access areas that permit no unauthorized 
entry.<P>
<H3><A NAME = sectionVI></A>Section VI: Questions 
and answers</H3>
<B>1. Under the DOT rules, must a SAP be certified by DOT in order to perform 
SAP functions?</B><P><B>
</B>The DOT does not certify, license, or approve individual SAPs. The SAP must be 
able to demonstrate to the employer qualifications necessary to meet DOT rule 
requirements. The DOT rules defines the SAP to be a licensed physician (Medical Doctor 
or Doctor of Osteopathy), a licensed or certified psychologist, a licensed or certified social 
worker, or a licensed or certified employee assistance professional. All must have 
knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of substance abuse-
related disorders (the degrees and certificates alone do not confer this knowledge). In 
addition, alcohol and drug abuse counselors certified by the National Association of 
Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors (NAADAC) Certification Commission, a national 
organization that imposes qualification standards for treatment of alcohol-related 
disorders, are included in the SAP definition.<P>
<B>2. Can SAP evaluations be conducted telephonically?</B><P><B>
</B>Both the initial and follow-up SAP evaluations are clinical processes that must be 
conducted face-to-face. Body language and appearance offer important physical cues vital 
to the evaluation process. Tremors, needle marks, dilated pupils, exaggerated movements, 
yellow eyes, glazed or bloodshot eyes, lack of eye contact, a physical slowdown or 
hyperactivity, appearance, posture, carriage, and ability to communicate in person are vital 
components that cannot be determined telephonically. In-person sessions carry with them 
the added advantage of the SAP's being able to provide immediate attention to individuals 
who may be a danger to themselves or others.<P>
<B>3. Are employers required to refer a discharged employee to a 
SAP?</B><P><B>
</B>The rules require an employer to advise the employee, who engages in conduct 
prohibited under the DOT rules, of the available resources for evaluation and treatment 
including the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of SAPs and counseling and 
treatment programs. In the scenario where the employer discharges the employee, that 
employer would be considered to be in compliance with the rules if they provide the list 
and ensure that SAPs on the list are qualified. This employer has no further obligation 
(e.g., facilitate referral to the SAP, ensure that the employee receives a SAP evaluation; 
pay for the evaluation; or seek to obtain, or maintain the SAP evaluation synopsis) than to 
present the employee with the required resource list and ensure that SAPs on the list are 
qualified.<P>
<B>4. How will the SAP evaluation process differ if the employee is discharged by 
the employer rather than retained following a rule violation?</B><P><B>
</B>After engaging in prohibited conduct and prior to performing safety-sensitive duties 
in any DOT regulated industry, the employee must receive a SAP evaluation. And, when 
assistance with a problem is clinically indicated, the employee must receive that assistance, 
and demonstrate successful compliance with the recommendation as evaluated through a 
SAP follow-up evaluation.<P>
The SAP process has the potential to be more complicated when the employee is not 
retained by that employer. In such circumstances, the SAP will likely not have a 
connection with the employer for whom the employee worked nor have immediate access 
to the exact nature of the rule violation. In addition, the SAP may have to hold the 
synopsis of evaluation and recommendation for assistance report until asked by the 
employee to forward that information to a gaining employer wishing to return the 
individual to safety-sensitive duties. In some cases, the SAP may provide the evaluation, 
referral to a treatment professional, and the follow-up evaluation before the employee has 
received an offer of employment. This circumstance may require the SAP to hold all 
reports until asked by the individual to forward them to the gaining employer. If the 
gaining employer has a designated SAP, that SAP may conduct the follow-up evaluation 
despite the fact that the employee's SAP has already done so. In other words, a gaining 
employer may determine to their own satisfaction (e.g., by having the prospective 
employee receive a follow-up SAP evaluation utilizing the employer's designated SAP) 
that the prospective employee has demonstrated successful compliance with recommended 
treatment.<P>
<B>5. Do community lectures and self-help groups qualify as education and / or 
treatment?</B><P><B>
</B>Self-help groups and community lectures qualify as education but do not qualify as 
treatment. While self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics 
Anonymous (NA) are crucial to many employees' recovery processes, these efforts are not 
considered to be treatment programs in and of themselves. However, they can serve as 
vital adjuncts in support of treatment program efforts. AA and NA programs require a 
level of anonymity which makes reporting client progress and prognosis for recovery 
impossible. If the client provides permission, AA and NA sponsors can provide attendance 
status reports to the SAP. Therefore, if a client is referred to one of these groups or to 
community lectures as a result of the SAP evaluation, the employee's attendance, when it 
can be independently validated, can satisfy a SAP recommendation for education as well 
as a gauge for determining treatment program successful compliance when both education 
and treatment are recommended by the SAP's evaluation.<P>
<B>6. Can an employee who has violated the rules return to safety-sensitive 
functions prior to receiving a SAP evaluation?</B><P><B>
</B>The employee is prohibited from performing any DOT regulated safety-sensitive 
function until being evaluated by the SAP. An employer is prohibited from permitting the 
employee to engage in safety-sensitive duties until evaluated. If the evaluation reveals that 
assistance is needed, the employee must receive the assistance, be re-evaluated by the SAP 
(and determined to have demonstrated successful compliance with the recommendations 
and pass a return-to-duty alcohol and/or drug test prior to performing safety-sensitive 
duties.<P>
<B>7. Can an employer overrule a SAP treatment recommendation?</B><P><B>
</B>If found to need assistance, the employee cannot return to safety-sensitive functions 
until a SAP's follow-up evaluation determines that the employee has demonstrated 
successful compliance with the recommended treatment. An employer who returns a 
worker to safety-sensitive duties when the employee has not complied with the SAP's 
recommendation is in violation of the DOT rule and is, therefore, subject to penalty.<P>
<B>8. Is an employer obligated to return an employee to safety-sensitive duty 
following the SAP's finding during the follow-up evaluation that the employee has 
demonstrated successful compliance with the treatment 
recommendation?</B><P><B>
</B>The DOT rules do not obligate an employer to return the employee to a safety-
sensitive job. Demonstrating successful compliance with prescribed treatment and testing 
negative on the return-to-duty alcohol test and/or drug test, are not guarantees of 
employment or of return to work in a safety-sensitive position; they are preconditions the 
employee must meet in order to be considered for hiring or reinstatement into safety-
sensitive duties by an employer.<P>
<B>9. Can an employee receive the follow-up evaluation from a SAP who did not 
conduct the initial SAP evaluation?</B><P><B>
</B>Although it is preferable for the same SAP to conduct both evaluations, this will not 
be realistic in some situations. For instance, the initial SAP may no longer be in the area, 
still under contract to the employer, or still hired by the employer to conduct the service. 
Additionally, the employee may have moved from the area to a new location. In all cases, 
the employer responsibility is to ensure that both the initial SAP and the follow-up SAP 
are qualified according to the DOT rules.<P>
<B>10. Who is responsible for reimbursing the SAP for services 
rendered?</B><P><B>
</B>The DOT rules do not affix responsibility for payment for SAP services upon any 
single party. The Department has left discussions regarding payment to employer policies 
and to labor-management agreements. Therefore, in some instances, this issue has become 
part of labor-management negotiations. Some employers have hired or contracted staff for 
the purpose of providing SAP services. For some employees, especially those who have 
been released following a violation, payment for SAP services will become their 
responsibility. - In any case, the SAP should be suitable to the employer who chooses to 
return the employee to safety-sensitive functions. Employer policies should address this 
payment issue.<P>
<B>11. Can the SAP direct that an employee be tested for both alcohol and drugs 
for the return-to-duty test and during the follow-up testing program?</B><P><B>
</B>If the SAP determines that an employee referred for alcohol misuse also uses drugs, 
or that an employee referred for drug use also misuses alcohol, the SAP can require that 
the individual be tested for both substances. The SAP's decision to test for both can be 
based upon information gathered during the initial evaluation, the SAP's consultation 
contacts with the treatment program, and/or the information presented during the follow-
up evaluation.<P>
<B>12. Can random testing be substituted for required follow-up 
testing?</B><P><B>
</B>Follow-up testing is directly related to a rule violation and subsequent return to 
safety-sensitive duty. Random tests are independent of rule violations. Therefore, the two 
test types are to be separated - one cannot be substituted for the other or be conducted in 
lieu of the other. Follow-up testing should be unpredictable, unannounced, and conducted 
not less than six times throughout the first 12 months - after the employee returns to 
safety-sensitive functions. Follow-up testing can last up to 60 months. An employee 
subject to follow-up testing will continue to be subject to an employer's random testing 
program.<P>
<B>13. If a company has several employees in follow-up testing, can those employees 
be placed into a follow-up random testing pool and selected for follow-up testing on 
a random basis?</B><P><B>
</B>Follow-up testing is not to be conducted in a random way. An employee's follow-up 
testing program is to be individualized and designed to ensure that the employee is tested 
the appropriate number of times as directed by the SAP. Random testing is neither 
individualized nor can it ensure that the employee receives the requisite number of 
tests.<P>
<B>14. Who is responsible for paying follow-up testing recommended by the 
SAP?</B><P><B>
</B>The DOT rules do not affix responsibility for payment for follow-up testing upon any 
single party. The Department has led discussions regarding payment to employer policies 
and to labor-management agreements. Therefore, in some instances, this issue has become 
part of labor-management negotiations. However, in making the decision to return the 
employee to safety-sensitive duty, the employer is, in essence, determining that costs 
associated with hiring and training a new employee exceeds costs associated with 
conducting follow-up testing of the returning employee. In any case, whether the employer 
pays or the employee pays, if the employee returns to performance safety-sensitive 
functions, the employer must ensure that follow-up testing occurs as required. The 
employer will be held accountable if the follow-up testing plan is not followed.<P>
<B>15. What actions are to occur if an employee tests positive while in the follow-up 
testing program?</B><P><B>
</B>Employees testing positive while in follow-up testing are subject to specific DOT 
operating administration rules regarding positive drug and alcohol tests. In addition, the 
employees are subject to employer policies related to second violations of DOT rules.<P>

<H1>How to Develop a Policy to 
Implement Drug and Alcohol 
Program</H1>
<H4>A three day-day seminar program for CEOs, presidents, 
senior level managers, human resources and safety personnel that 
will help you to develop a Drug and Alcohol corporate policy 
which will meet U.S. requirements in the Canadian legal 
environment.</H4>
<HR>
Presented by the Ontario Trucking Association Transportation Learning Centre in 
association with the Canadian Trucking Association<P>
<HR>
<H3>Drug and Alcohol Testing in Canada: a brief 
background</H3>
Due diligence towards ensuring worker safety in motor carrier operations. is a priority in 
the trucking industry. And,' substance' abuse is one of many factors that can significantly 
affect workplace safety and productivity. <P>
Transport Canada has now confirmed that it will not be legislating substance programs, 
leaving, companies to address these health and safety issues in the absence of Canadian 
legislation. Program decisions are further complicated for carriers with drivers that operate 
into the United States who will be required to comply with complex and extensive U.S. 
drug and alcohol testing regulations as early as July 1, 1996. These companies must ensure 
that their employees are subject to testing for substance use in a number of prescribed 
situations.<P>
The onus for developing programs that meet U.S. .requirements within the Canadian legal 
environment rests with the Canadian industry. This means that each company will have to 
develop its own policy which must:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Be written and communicated; 
<LI>Provide clear direction; 
<LI>Outline the applicable rules;
<LI>Clarify opportunities for assistance; 
<LI>Set out consequences for policy violation
</UL>
In making these decisions, companies must be aware of the Canadian legal environment 
including:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Operating Liabilities;
<LI>Occupational Health and Safety: and 
<LI>Human Rights Legislation
</UL>
<H3>About the Program</H3>
This comprehensive program will help companies to develop and finalize a policy 
statement that meets their specific needs, and finds the appropriate balance between health 
and safety (due diligence) and respect for individual privacy.<P>
<H3>Key Topics of Discussion</H3>
This three-part learning session will address key areas such as: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Defining objectives, applying your policy, and meeting, the required standards;
<LI>Understanding the applicable rules and responsibilities;
<LI>Prevention components in the areas of education and training;
<LI>Making difficult decisions on issues such as safety-sensitive positions, alcohol and, 
drug testing, hosting, searches, dealing with contractors, and consequences for policy 
violation;
<LI>A Implementation and communication vehicles.

<H1>Assessing Costs: Substance Abuse in the Workplace</H1>
<H2>A Literature Review for the <BR>
Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission<BR>
in collaboration with the <BR>
Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse<BR>
August, 1995</H2>
<H3>by R.H. McVicar and Associates: <BR>
Sharon J. Pearson, MA Econ., Philip Jacobs, PhD Econ., and Richard
H.M. Plain, PhD Econ.<BR>
AADAC Contract #221-96-1</H3>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="executive"></A>Executive summary</H3>

<P>
A literature review of the costs associated with substance abuse
in the workplace was conducted in March and April of 1995. The
aim was to identify methodological and conceptual issues and provide
recommendations for assessing the workplace costs of substance
abuse.
<H4><A NAME="org"></A>Organizational Framework</H4>

<P>
Seven research questions were posed by the funding agency (AADAC)
about the definition, measurement and quantification of alcohol
and other drug abuse costs using the workplace as the frame of
reference. These questions concerned:
<OL>
<LI>identification of the range of health, safety and other consequences
related to workplace substance use;
<LI>prevalence estimates of the extent of workplace problems;
<LI>the logic and classification of social and economic costs;
<LI>the causal relationship between substance abuse and the development
of workplace problems;
<LI>the attribution factors to employ in estimating workplace
costs;
<LI>use of the human capital approach in cost estimation; and
<LI>additional issues brought to the fore as a result of the literature
review.
</OL>

<P>
The literature review was based on 22 articles, eight of which
were considered to be of major importance. Most were published
in 1987 or later with the exception being the seminal work of
Berry and Boland (1977). The organization of the literature review
is based on the seven research questions outlined by AADAC.
<H4><A NAME="overview"></A>Overview of Results</H4>

<P>
The range of substance-related workplace problems identified in
the review include: premature death, fatal and injury accidents,
absenteeism, extra sick leave, employee turnover, medical costs,
disciplinary procedures, loss of industry, household and military
production, tardiness, unemployment, and drug testing.
<P>
Estimating the prevalence of workplace problems is a complex procedure
as they change over time and across different cultures--cultures
within industries and firms, as well as within nations. Past abuse
can often create ongoing and future problems which need to be
included in any estimate of prevalence rates.
<P>
In reviewing the social and economic costs of workplace substance
abuse, one is struck by three major problems: (1) the variety
of vocabulary used to describe costs, (2) the confusion created
by lack of consistency and cohesiveness, and (3) the inconsistent
logic regarding the inclusion or exclusion of an item as a cost
under various circumstances. Another major issue is the idea of
additive cost analysis being attempted without knowing what use
is going to be made of the cost estimates. Adding up costs in
general, perhaps to signal the magnitude of the problem, has resulted
in overstatement and lack of credibility, and is not particularly
useful from a policy perspective. Thus, the range of magnitudes
presented in the various studies are wide and difficult to correlate
and compare.
<P>
The causality and attribution issues are as complex as the estimation
of prevalence. The effects of substance use are cumulative, so
age is important. Many studies do not distinguish between causality
and association, and there are significant differences between
men and women in terms of the effects, the reliability of self-reported
data, and the stigmatization associated with alcohol and drug
abuse. This points towards important implications for policy and
intervention design. Moreover, none of these concepts-- prevalence,
attribution, causality--can answer the theoretical questions concerning
the inclusion or exclusion of premature death and loss of production
as a cost in the analysis.
<P>
Although all the reviewed papers used the human capital approach,
a few recently published papers, such as Collins and Lapsley (1994),
use the demographic approach in valuations of loss of production
and mortality. The demographic approach compares the actual population
with a hypothetical non-abusing population. In the human capital
approach, the loss of productivity is quantified in terms of a
discounted stream of future earning on the assumption that the
loss of average wage is a reasonable approximation of the value
of lost output. While the fine points of both approaches may be
discussed extensively, the more basic question is whether to count
lost production as a cost.
<P>
In reviewing the literature, numerous additional ideas and issues
relevant to estimating the costs of substance use to the workplace
could be identified. These issues fall into two categories: (1)
those narrow issues that are concerned with the methodology in
estimating a type of cost, and (2) those broader issues concerned
with the nature of substance abuse and the nature of a social
cost.
<P>
The role of economic theory is very important in reaching any
conclusions about analyzing the workplace costs of substance use.
First, it is necessary to decide which economic model will be
used to build the framework or foundation for assessing workplace
costs (i.e., neoclassical economic theory or economic theories
of addiction). Second, a decision has to be made regarding which
economic unit will be the basis for measuring costs (i.e., the
household, the individual, or even the employer alone). Finally,
the assumption about unemployment regarding the exclusion or inclusion
of mortality costs has to be made clear (i.e., the full employment
model or a model that assumes high enough unemployment rate so
that deceased or fired workers are replaced).
<P>
In terms of pure economics, a cost is included when real resources
are being used that have an alternative use. Due to the problems
mentioned earlier, pure economic theory alone cannot give a recipe
or manual that can tell us what is and what is not a cost. A multidisciplinary
approach, further data collection, and research into the even
more basic questions regarding human behaviour and substance abuse
are necessary.

<UL>
<LI>To conduct a literature review of cost estimations of substance
use in the context of the workplace.
<LI>To provide recommendations relevance assessing alcohol and
other drug costs in the context of the workplace.
<LI>To conduct the literature review in the light of contributing

<H4>1.2 Issues</H4>

<P>
Within the frame of reference of the workplace, the major issues
of concern include: definition, measurement, and quantification
of alcohol and other drug abuse costs.
<H4>1.3 Research Questions</H4>

<P>
The aim of the literature review was to examine cost estimation
in the context of the workplace by focusing on the following seven
questions outlined by the funding agency (AADAC). In addition,
the reviewer assessed the literature for the reasons given for
the importance of assessing the workplace costs of drug and alcohol
use.
<OL>
<LI>What are the particular workplace problems associated with
alcohol and other drug use? The review will identify the range
of health, safety, and other consequences related to workplace
substance use.
<LI>To what extent do these problems occur? The study will inventory
and evaluate existing national, provincial and industry-specific
data sources which report the incidence of workplace problems
related to alcohol and other drug use.
<LI>What are the social and economic costs of workplace problems
related to substance use? The study will address the logic of
the cost-accounting framework by (1) reviewing variable classification
and the underlying rationale for including/excluding certain costs,
and (2) undertaking a critical analysis of data sources, measures,
and quantification methods.
<LI>What is the nature of the causal relationship between workplace
problems and substance use? The review will examine the relative
contribution of alcohol and other drugs as primary or secondary
agents in the development of workplace problems.
<LI>What are the most appropriate attribution factors that can
be applied in estimating the cost of workplace problems? The study
will assess causality in terms of data validity and reliability,
and will suggest possible methods for gathering missing data.
<LI>What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of using
the human capital versus the demographic approach in estimating
workplace costs? The study will suggest a preferred approach to
reduce or eliminate the variability in mortality and morbidity
estimates.
<LI>Are there additional questions or concerns relevant to assessing
the costs of substance in the workplace? Issues identified during
the review will be discussed, and wherever possible, practical
solutions offered to address these in future costing studies.

<H4>1.4 Review of the Literature</H4>

<P>
A literature search was conducted during the first week of March,
1995. Six databases were searched using two sets of search terms:
(1) cost, economics, cost-effectiveness, and (2) substance abuse,
alcohol, tobacco, smoking, drugs. The six databases and time line
references were: Psychlit Books and Chapters (1987 to November,
1994) - 94 entries; PAIS (1972 to October, 1994) - 14 entries;
Psychlit (1987 to November, 1994) - 66 entries; Sociofile (1974
to December, 1994) - 49 entries; Medline (1991 to February, 1995)
- 105 entries; Econlit (1969 to September, 1994) - 77 entries.
In total, the search produced 405 entries.
<P>
The printouts from these databases were carefully analyzed to
narrow the search to the specific parameters of estimations of
workplace costs of drug and alcohol abuse as outlined by the above
research questions. Twenty-one (21) references were obtained from
this list. Although outside the basic time frame, one additional
entry (Berry &amp; Boland, 1977) was included because of its use
as the basis for cost estimation in other references and its stand-alone
importance in the measurement of loss of productivity due to alcohol
and drug use.
<P>
Of the 22 reference articles obtained, only eight could be considered
to be of major importance to the specific issue of assessing the
workplace costs of drug and alcohol use. These included: [1] Berry
and Boland (1977), [3] Fillmore (1984), [10] Heien and Pittman
(1993), [11] Manning, et al., (1991), [14] Miller and Kelman (1992),
[16] Raskin (1993), [17] Rice, et al., (1991), and [22] Zwerling
(1993). Four of the remaining studies addressed problem identification,
attribution and analytical techniques (French, et al., 1991; Harlow
and Swint, 1981; Harlow and Swint, 1989; Raskin, 1993). The remaining
ten references were best analyzed in the context of helping to
identify and define workplace problems associated with alcohol
and drug use, helping understand why estimation of the cost of
these problems is important, and suggesting areas of future study.
<H3><A NAME="measuring"></A>2. Measuring costs</H3>

<H4>2.1 Definitions</H4>

<P>
The issue of how to measure 'the cost of substance abuse' has
been a controversial one. One of the reasons for the controversy
has been that there is some disagreement over the meaning of the
variable 'cost', which is being measured. In their classic book
on this issue, Berry and Boland (1977) define the cost of substance
abuse as the productivity that is lost due to substance abuse.
Assuming that firms pay workers the value of their productivity,
Berry and Boland measured the cost of alcohol abuse as the difference
between the actual wages of abusers and the wages of non-abusers.
<P>
Subsequently, writers have disagreed with this measure. McGuire
and Ruhm (1980) assert that the major economic issue of substance
abuse is the involuntary costs imposed by abusers on non-abusers.
Since abusers presumably are <I>voluntarily </I>accepting lower
wages when they use drugs and alcohol, they are willingly accepting
lower wages and higher risks as one of the costs of this activity.
Therefore, the benefits they obtain from consuming the substances
exceeds the costs. These investigators argue that the only costs
which are imposed as a result of substance abuse are those which
are imposed on non-abusers. These costs have been alternatively
termed 'external' costs and 'social' costs. Other writers have
criticized the McGuire and Ruhm approach, on the grounds that
substance abuse is not voluntary but addictive. There are no true
benefits from addiction, they claim, and so there are indeed private
(as well as social) costs resulting from substance abuse.
<P>
Further issues surrounding the definition of cost relate to the
treatment of addiction and the definition of the consuming unit.
Some writers (Becker and Murphy, 1988; Godfrey and Maynard, 1988;
Maynard, 1992) have questioned the hypothesis that benefits offset
costs (and hence cancel out costs) when individuals are addicted.
The argument that only external costs are true costs would carry
less weight in this case. Furthermore, which costs are considered
external depends on how the consuming unit is defined. If the
consuming unit is the family, then many negative effects caused
by a substance abuser to other family members would not be counted.
Sindelar (1993) has asserted that costs would be very different
if the unit of analysis was the individual, not the family.
<P>
In addition to those mentioned above, there are other definitions
of cost, and how these are defined depends on the purpose of the
analysis. If the purpose is to measure the financial burden of
abusers, costs would include any money received as transfer payments
(e.g., unemployment insurance and social assistance). However,
this is not a measure of the overall change in resources used
by substance abuse, and does not correspond to the economist's
definition of cost. Nevertheless, it is a valid inquiry. Alternatively,
one can measure the costs and outcomes or benefits of specific
interventions related to abuse. This purpose is different from
wanting to find out the social magnitude of the problem, and the
cost measure will differ. In this case, only costs and benefits
which change because of the interventions would be measured.
<P>
Finally, as defined by economists, 'pain and suffering' does not
result in a cost (change in resources used). Pain and suffering
affects 'utility' and can best be treated as a reduction in benefits.
Although difficult to measure, there are economic scales which
do attempt to measure change in pain and suffering. It is more
appropriate to view pain and suffering from the vantage point
of these scales, rather than as costs.
<H4>2.2 A Framework to Discuss Workplace Costs</H4>

<P>
<B>2.2.1 Cost Study Purpose</B> 
<P>
The concepts to be used to define and measure cost should be related
to the purpose of the study. There are several alternative purposes
that a study can have. These are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>The study can be used to determine the net <B>social impact
</B>of drug and alcohol abuse. This is the net cost of abuse on
all or specific members of society.
<LI>The study can be used to determine the net <B>budgetary impact
</B>of drug and alcohol abuse on specific government agencies
or businesses.
<LI>The study can be used to determine the <B>cost effectiveness
of specific interventions </B>to reduce substance abuse.
</UL>

<P>
<B>2.2.2 Cost Concepts</B> 
<P>
There are several alternative concepts of costs that can be adopted.
These concepts will guide how measurements are made. They are:
<UL>
<LI><B>Private or internal costs;</B>costs which fall on the abuser.
<LI><B>External costs</B>or costs which fall on individuals or
groups other than the abuser.
<LI><B>Budgetary effects</B>which are not always resource costs,
but represent the financial effects of substance abuse, and can
include transfer payments.
</UL>

<P>
<B>2.2.3 Assumptions/Frameworks</B> 
<P>
There are several alternative analytical frameworks (or paradigms)
which can be adopted. The choice of framework has an influence
on how costs will be measured. These are as follows:
<UL>
<LI><B>The treatment of addiction.</B>Addiction can be treated
as an abnormal condition which yields no utility benefits. If
this paradigm is adopted, then the costs of substance abuse are
not assumed to be offset with utility benefits of consumption.
Private costs will arise. The alternative treatment of addiction
is to assume that the costs of substance abuse are offset by the
benefits of consumption. In this case, there are no net private
costs of substance abuse.
<LI><B>The definition of the consuming unit.</B>There are two
alternative treatments here as well. First, the household can
be considered the consuming unit. If this approach is adopted,
there are no costs imposed on other members of the household due
to substance abuse. For example, spouses and children are not
considered external bodies. The second approach counts all individuals,
other than the abuser, as external bodies.
</UL>

<P>
<B>2.3 Application of Cost Analysis to the Workplace</B> 
<P>
In applying substance abuse analysis in the workplace context,
there are two specific issues that need to be dealt with. The
first deals with the assumption concerning employment. The analyst
must determine whether full employment is being assumed, or whether
general unemployment is assumed. If general unemployment is assumed,
then if individuals who were unemployed replace the (formerly)
employed abuser, there will be a net cancellation of social costs.
However, if the economy were in full employment, the abuser who
loses his/her job may not be replaced, and there will be a net
social loss. A third possibility is that abusers can be assumed
to retain their jobs, but be less productive.
<P>
The second major point relates to the formation of a framework
to analyze workplace losses. This type of framework is presented
in Figure 1 (). It specifically focuses on workplace costs, rather
than the costs of substance abuse in general. The diagram assumes
that one is measuring external or social costs, although the analysis
could be changed to include private costs by simply adding reduced
wages. Further, the framework identifies testing costs for prospective
employees, employee assistance program costs, recruitment and
training costs for replacement workers, and costs due to changed
productivity. Employee assistance, recruitment and training, and
testing all require resources, and hence result in economic costs.
Excluded are the costs of random testing, only because the diagram
would become unduly complicated.
<P>
As shown, reduced output imposes costs on the firm, as well as
on the abusing worker. Generally, lost production results in a
reduction in the value added associated with the output. <I>Value
added </I>(VA) includes interest payments on capital owned by
the firm, rental payments to resource owners, profits and wages
(W). The firm loses value added from lost output. However, some
of this value added can be recouped by the firm, if it reduces
the worker's wages. In this case, the wage portion of the cost
will fall to the worker, but the remainder of the value added
(VA-W) will be lost to the firm and the owners of the other inputs.
The 'economic cost of substance abuse' will be equal to VA- W.
<P>
If, however, the firm still pays the worker the same amount, despite
the reduced volume of output, then the firm incurs a loss equal
to the entire value added. In effect, the worker receives a transfer
payment from the firm which is not related to resource use. The
external or social cost which is imposed on the firm is the VA
of the lost output.
<H3><A NAME="problem"></A>3. Problem identification</H3>

<P>
The literature identifies a range of health, safety and other
consequences related to workplace substance use. These include
premature death, fatal and injury accidents, absenteeism, extra
sick leave, employee turnover, medical costs, disciplinary procedures,
loss of industry, household and military production, tardiness,
unemployment, and drug testing.
<P>
Among the articles reviewed, there is consensus (except for Heien
and Pittman) that the loss of industrial production is a problem
of alcohol and drug abuse as well as the loss from premature death.
All other problems can be considered subsets of these two. For
example, absenteeism would be covered under loss of production,
and fatal accidents under premature death. The exception is unemployment
due to alcohol and drug abuse. To the extent that the abusing
worker is replaced by an unemployed member of the economy no loss
of production should be assessed. In other words, the abusing
workers who have a job could cause loss of production, but once
replaced, no losses should occur.
<P>
<B>RASKIN:</B> 
<P>
In general, the literature reviewed assumed the use of alcohol
and drugs had a negative effect in the workplace. In a notable
exception, [16] Raskin extensively discusses the link between
use and impairment and stresses the inability of studies to demonstrate
impairment and poor performance. S. Alvi is cited in a Conference
Board of Canada paper (1992) discussing the difficulties with
the causality between drug use and poor performance, especially
in the context of a positive urine test.
<P>
In looking at drug testing, Raskin states that proponents assert
higher levels of absenteeism and sick leave by those testing positive
for drugs and alcohol as well as significantly more accidents.
Opponents of drug testing claim that testing cannot show impairment
regarding ability to perform on the job. Raskin cites the reasons
for drug testing: productivity and safety, employer liability,
public safety, and deterrence. The arguments against drug and
alcohol testing include: inability to demonstrate impairment,
privacy and management style.
<P>
The arguments for drug testing in the United States have been
aided by several well publicized transport accidents in which
controlled substances were found in the crew. This led to a 1986
Presidential Executive Order mandating a drug-free workplace (p.
64).
<P>
<B>FILLMORE:</B> 
<P>
The perspective of the sociology of science in [3] Fillmore's
article gives a fascinating look at the competing paradigms of
temperance scholars and the modern alcoholism movement. The focus
is on how science regarded alcohol's relation to the workplace
by comparing and contrasting the Temperance Movement and the Modern
Alcoholism Movement. This article &quot; . . . suggests that alcohol
research in respect to workplace, has been subservient to alcohol
policy-making since the last years of the nineteenth century&quot;.
(p. 40)
<P>
Fillmore points out that pre-industrial revolution work and drinking
were inseparable and drink was intertwined with hard work. Alcohol
was seen to increase productivity by maintaining the reliability
of the labour force especially when involved in very tedious work.
As the temperance movement and industrialization progressed, the
combination of drinking and working was perceived negatively.
The movement very early brought employers on side by associating
abstinence as good for business and attacks on alcohol were part
of efficiency requirements. Safety studies from insurance statistics
suggested alcohol was a major contributor to injuries and mortality
in industry. Early temperance scholars linked extreme poverty
and alcohol interaction with the nature of work and alcohol-related
mortality and morbidity.
<P>
Rather than viewing alcohol-related problems as the effect of
an impoverished lifestyle and the stress created by the working
conditions, alcohol came to be seen as the causal factor. Thus,
study of the structure of the workplace and its relation to alcohol
use were ignored for decades.
<P>
The modern alcoholism movement began to concentrate on finding
'hidden alcoholics' for 'treatment' and began to publicize the
economic loss to industry from alcoholism in the workforce. Alcohol
became the independent variable to predict costs to society. Rather
than seeing only skid-row alcoholism as a problem (citing data
from Straus and Bacon, 1951), Fillmore points out that the image
of an employed, salaried worker as possibly having problems with
alcohol became accepted.
<P>
From managers of England's war production in World War I complaining
of drunkenness resulting in lost time and poor production (p.
43), to the recognition that alcohol is a disturbing factor whenever
speed, timing and coordination are required when men handle machinery,
regulations against alcohol were used to reduce accidents, absenteeism
and increase productivity. Thus, the alcoholism movement could
intervene in industry to find and rescue 'hidden alcoholics' and
employers were encouraged to cooperate to reduce the problems
in the workplace, thereby reducing costs. Historically, the emphasis
started on reducing accidents, then moved to reducing absenteeism,
and subsequently to increasing performance.
<P>
<B>ZWERLING:</B> 
<P>
[22] Zwerling outlines safety, productivity, decreasing drug use
and regulations as the most common reasons for drug testing. It
is also suggested that drug testing could increase productivity
by reducing absenteeism, medical costs, disciplinary procedures
and employee assistance program [EAP] costs (p. 184). On the other
hand, three studies are cited (p. 186) that examine the relationship
between drug use in young adults and productivity as measured
by wages. These studies found that drug users had higher wages
than non-users. Long-term or on-the-job use of marijuana lowered
wages but net productivity for all marijuana users was increased.
Zwerling presents an extensive list of studies of alcohol and
non-fatal occupational injuries (p. 175-178).
<P>
<B>MILLER AND KELMAN:</B> 
<P>
[14] Miller and Kelman (citing Becker, 1967) list the gradual
depletion of individual skill and work effort from alcohol, drug
abuse and mental illness (ADM). This article also points out that
for ADM prevalence only an associative relationship exists between
group membership and any measure of productivity impairment (p.
125).
<P>
<B>HEIEN AND PITTMAN:</B> 
<P>
On the other hand, the &quot;...alleged negative relation between
productivity and alcohol abuse has not been demonstrated...&quot;
according to Cook (1990) and cited in [l0] Heien and Pittman (p.
304). In their critique of NIAAA studies on morbidity, Heien and
Pittman ignore any productivity losses as private costs. If lower
individual income results from alcohol abuse this should be assessed
as private cost, not as an external cost. External costs should
be measured as &quot;...the cost of damages done to non-abusers
by the abusing population&quot; (p. 302). The work by Berry and
Boland, especially as used as a basis for NIAAA studies is criticized
on this basis as well.
<P>
<B>BERRY AND BOLAND:</B> 
<P>
[1] Berry and Boland count the lost production due to alcohol
abuse as an irretrievable loss to society; thus it counts as an
economic cost. They would also like to see some measure of the
loss of household production included in any assessment of costs
of abuse. Tardiness, absenteeism, and temporary or permanent withdrawal
from labour force are seen as reducing the production of goods
and services. As well, non-market activities or family-produced
goods and services such as child care, housekeeping, meal preparation
and recreation are also reduced and reflect a lower level of household
production resulting in a real economic cost (p. 28).
<P>
Although they state that the broad question of &quot;How much
more productive would alcohol-abusing workers be if they were
not abusers?&quot; as being unanswered, some limited questions,
such as, &quot;Given the present productivity of the worker as
measured by his present wage, what are the costs of alcohol abuse
to the firm?&quot; have been used in designing studies. They cite
work by Pell and D'Alonzo (1973) as revealing the nature of the
problem. They note that &quot;...the cost of alcoholism to industry
is made up of several components, including loss of efficiency,
absenteeism, lost time on the job as well as off the job, faulty
decision making, accidents, impaired morale of co-workers, and
the cost, of rehabilitation programs. A large and significant
portion of the economic impact of alcoholism also includes premature
disability and death, resulting in the loss of many employees
in their prime who have skills that are difficult to replace&quot;
(p. 37). That study is compared to an Australian study by Holtmann
(1963) and Pritchard (1971) using premature mortality, excess
morbidity, absenteeism and unemployment as related to lost production
(p. 38-39).
<P>
Although the worker with alcohol related problems can be identified
by absenteeism, tardiness, and sickness, &quot;...very little
is known about the alcohol-troubled worker who has lower productivity
that is not recorded in terms of time off the job but whose problems
are manifested in a more subtle form. Part of the measurement
problem is that nearly everyone drinks and many drink a great
deal with little apparent effect on their productivity&quot; (p.
43- 44).
<P>
Citing Cahalan, et al., (1972), Berry and Boland point out that
drinkers who have difficulty functioning in society likely have
lower productivity which is reflected in their earnings. This
assumes that a dysfunctional group can be identified and labour
markets will correct for the lowered productivity (p. 47). Berry
and Boland also estimate lost production due to alcohol abuse
in the military. Accordingly, this loss of non-market activity
is justified as a cost to society because producing national defence
consumes an economy's scarce resources (p. 55).
<P>
<B>RICE. et al.,:</B> 
<P>
[171 Rice, et al., (1993) include the costs of mortality as premature
deaths from ADM and the costs of morbidity as &quot;...the value
of productivity lost by those unable to perform their usual activities
or unable to perform at full effectiveness&quot;... due to ADM
(p. 281). As well, they include an imputed value for housekeeping
services as lost production.
<P>
<B>MANNING. et al.,:</B> 
<P>
In The <I>Cost of Poor Health Habits, </I>[11] Manning, et al.,
list a table of the type of problems that generate costs due to
smoking, but apply the same conceptual framework to heavy drinking.
The list includes premature death, medical costs, sick leave,
disability, group life insurance, pensions and lost wages.
<P>
Table 1 consists of a matrix which relates the author of each

<H3>4. Prevalence of workplace problems </H3>

<P>
Prevalence rates are a complex and thorny issue. Rates can change
over time. Rates also differ culturally--within the broad context
of nation, within the narrow context of type of industry, and
even within the very narrow context of different firms in a given
industry. Moreover, past substance abuse plays an ongoing role
in workplace problems for years after the abuse has stopped. Not
only current abuse but past abuse is relevant for assessing workplace
costs. Older studies are plagued by problems because of the use
of outdated prevalence rates and at times, the use of rates from
other cultures.
<P>
<B>FILLMORE:</B> 
<P>
[3] Fillmore suggests that the prevalence estimates (and perceived
costs) of alcoholism in the workplace coming from the contemporary
scientific community were used by policy makers to &quot;...invade
the workplace with alcoholism programs&quot; (p. 40). Historically
alcohol problems were predominantly seen to be endemic to the
working class, the undeserving poor or industrial workers, rather
than society as a whole. Early temperance scholars found an overrepresentation
of workplace problems in occupations where alcohol was related
to the nature of the work. Prevalence estimates were necessary
to reinforce two important concepts: &quot;...alcoholics were
in fact in the world of business and industry and were costing
these institutions money&quot; (p. 47).
<P>
The goal of promotion of occupational alcoholism programs meant
that businesses had to be convinced there was a problem. As early
as 1942 it was estimated &quot; . . .about 80% of male inebriates
were employed...&quot; [Jellinek (1947) cited by Fillmore (p.
48)] although this was unsupported by data sources. A 1951 study
indicated 63% of male alcoholism patients held a job when entering
treatment and 56% had held a steady job for three years [Straus
(1949) and Bacon (1947) cited by Fillmore (p. 49)]. In 1943, Jellinek
estimated &quot;...these men lost on the average 22 days per year
because of acute intoxication...&quot; and had a fatal accident
rate of more than twice that of non-alcoholics. Although contemporary
single industry studies could not be aggregated to generate this
high a figure, it remained prevalent in the alcohol literature

<P>
<B>BERRY AND BOLAND:</B> 
<P>
Prevalence rates may be relevant for past alcohol abusers as well
as workers presently having alcohol-related problems. [1] Berry
and Boland point out &quot;...that the present and past economic
behavior of problem drinkers is significantly different from that
of non-problem drinkers'' (p. 37). For example, absences per annum
were significantly higher for all classifications of alcoholism
(known, suspected and recovered). This suggests long-term problems
with productivity losses even in the recovery stage, or that alcoholics
are problem workers even without alcohol [Pell and D'Alonzo (1973)
cited by Berry and Boland (p. 37)].
<P>
According to Berry and Boland, an alcohol prevalence rate of about
4% of the workforce is generally accepted, although Pell and D'Alonzo
(1973) reported a rate of about 1% in a comprehensive single company
study (p. 37) and Cahalan, et al., (1972) approximated a 2% prevalence
rate in the military (p. 55).
<P>
<B>ZWERLING:</B> 
<P>
[22] Zwerling points out that early rates of incidence of events
used by proponents of drug-testing were that drug-abusing employees
had three to four times more accidents at work, and five times
the compensable injuries of other employees. Forty percent (40%)
of industrial fatalities and 47% of industrial injuries could
be traced to alcohol abuse. While not &quot;...backed by substantive
empirical evidence, they appeared plausible...&quot; due to the
impairment of motor coordination and perceptual abilities associated
with alcohol and drugs (p. 161). In the early 1980s, figures used
by politicians were: absenteeism, 16 times more for abusers than
the average employee, and impaired workers functioning at approximately
half their normal capacity (p. 162).
<P>
<B>SHAHANDEH:</B> 
<P>
Using studies at General Motors, [l8] Shahandeh derived the following
estimates: twice as many occupational injuries, 15 times the visits
to the medical department, and 25 times more days of disability
leave for drug-dependent employees than non-drug dependent workers.
Alcoholics have 16 times the absences, two-and-a-half times as
many absences of eight days or more, five times the compensation
claims, three times more sick leave, and three times the accident
rate of other employees. Another study using control groups showed
that the combined on-the-job and off-the-job accident rate for
alcohol- dependent workers was 3.6 times that of the controls.
<P>
<B>VAN IWAARDEN:</B> 
<P>
[20] Van Iwaarden points out that between 1977 and 1982 approximately
1 % of all the work disability cases in the Netherlands were caused
by excessive alcohol use (p. 1208).
<P>
<B>NAKAMURA. et al.,:</B> 
<P>
In assessing the social cost of alcohol abuse in Japan, [15] Nakamura,
et al., used prevalence rates from Berry and Boland's 1977 work.
<P>
<B>MCGUIRE AND RUHM:</B> 
<P>
In an unpublished discussion paper, [13] McGuire and Ruhm ignore
the costs of drug abuse external to labour contracts to develop
a prevalence model of estimation based on the payment of expected
marginal product (p. 7, p. 21). In terms of perception of the
problem, they cite a paper by Hansen (1988) showing that 80% of
CEO's, human resource executives, governors, and mayors state
that alcohol and drug abuse constitute 'significant' or 'very
significant' problems in their workplaces. According to these
authors, household surveys show that 70% of illicit drug users
are in the workforce (p.&#171;S).
<H3><A NAME="logic"></A>5. The logic of the cost- accounting framework
</H3>

<P>
In reviewing the literature, the most striking features are (1)
the variety of vocabulary used to describe costs, (2) the lack
of consistency and cohesiveness among the studies which creates
unnecessary confusion, and (3) the inconsistent logic applied
to what is and what is not counted as a cost. For example, private
versus social costs, direct versus indirect costs, core costs,
external costs, incurred costs, and market versus non-market costs
are all terms used by various studies. Each type of workplace
problem identified previously could potentially generate costs
to someone. These have to be classified and then a rationale has
to be given for inclusion or exclusion.
<P>
As a result, two fundamental problems arise. The first is distinguishing
if a potential loss is an economic cost or not. This depends upon
who incurs the cost and if it is coordinated with a benefit to
the same economic unit incurring the cost. The market price of
alcohol and lower wages due to lower productivity for employed
alcohol abusers are assumed to be costs to the consumers/employees.
Under the non-addiction framework, these costs are assumed to
be exactly offset by the benefits to the abusers. However, under
the addiction framework, there are no benefit offsets. Compare
this to the cost of lost production incurred by an employer due
to an error or accident associated with alcohol consumption. The
individuals consuming the alcohol are assumed to do so for their
own benefit but the loss is external to the individual and is
borne by the employer. This is a real economic cost under all
circumstances.
<P>
The second problem is the exclusion/inclusion factor. This problem
is most relevant when an assessment of costs is being attempted
<I>without knowing what use is going to be made of the costs.
</I>For example, what one study considers a cost, another would
consider a transfer payment. The appropriate classification of
costs depends upon the perspective used in the assessment of the
costs. If an unemployed alcoholic receives unemployment insurance
benefits it is a budgetary cost to government. From society's
perspective however, it is a transfer from taxpayers. The administrative
costs of this transfer are borne by society as those resources
used to administer the program could have been allocated to other
uses or programs--society faces an opportunity cost.
<P>
Without knowing why costs are being assessed, even a narrow spectrum
of costs such as 'costs in the workplace' become problematic if
no rationale other than 'adding up costs in general' is given
to the assessment. When costs are assessed in a cost-benefit,
cost-utility, or cost-effectiveness study, the rationale for inclusion/exclusion
becomes much clearer. This is why [10] Heien and Pittman point
out that merely totalling up costs is not particularly useful
from a policy perspective. They suggest cost-benefit analysis
is the proper approach (p. 303). This is also why they critique
NIAAA's costing methodology and even argue that productivity losses
are private costs, when the consensus of other authors is that
losses to production make up a large part of costs of alcohol
and drug abuse.
<P>
<B>BERRY AND BOLAND:</B> 
<P>
[1]] Berry and Boland include the cost of lost production in three
areas. The definition of the economic cost of lost production
is &quot;...approximated by estimating the market value of what
might have been produced by alcohol abusers if they had no productivity
problems associated with alcohol&quot; (p. 28). This is an example
of the counter- factual methodology. By assuming a tendency for
earnings to reflect economic productivity, estimates of the market
value of lost production are represented as the amount of r&lt;
~uced earnings of workers with alcohol problems. Labour income
simultaneously represents costs to producers and income to households
(p. 29). Obviously, if both amounts are included, this would represent
double counting--a significant problem in some studies.
<P>
In assessing non-market production losses, the authors point out
that if the wife of an alcohol abusing worker enters the labour
force to help maintain the family's standard of living, it would
be incorrect to subtract the wife's market sector output from
production- loss related to alcoholism as this change in the economic
structure of the family involves forgone production within the
home (p. 30). They also address the data collection problems of
assessing &quot;...other groups within society whose economic
and social behavior may reduce economic productivity because of
alcohol abuse.&quot; For example, women, persons in institutions
and skid row alcoholics (p. 31). Production loss within the family
is also problematic due to the lack of a convenient common unit
of account. At best, family outputs can be priced by looking at
the prices of related market goods such as babysitting services,
wages of maids and handymen, restaurant prices, etc. (p. 32).
These problems with non-market production lead to under-valuation.
<P>
The authors cite studies by Trice and Roman (1972) and Winslow
(1966), noting that (1) the cost of days absent without pay are
borne by the worker, (2) problem workers, drinking and non-drinking,
are equally costly, and (3) firms already pay a higher base daily
wage to the problem-free employees than to suspected problem drinking
employees (p. 36). This is consistent with economic theory that
predicts that wages and productivity are directly related.
<P>
Although lower wages reflect the lower productivity of alcohol
abusing workers, if the difference in productivity due to alcohol
abuse is greater than the difference in wages between abusers
and non-abusers, the firm will be bearing that part of cost production.
This is an economic cost that is not borne directly by the abuser.
Thus, letting wage differences stand for lost production under-estimates
the total but is the best available approximation (p. 43).
<P>
In terms of non-market production, reduced military output due
to alcohol abuse is included. The output of the military is national
defence and producing this output involves a loss of approximately
2 % of its potential labour productivity because of alcohol abuse
(p. 55). The following table is a summary of the estimates calculated
by Berry and Boland.<HR>

This style of analysis makes it clear what is measured and what
is left out. It has a reasonable economic rationale behind its
methodology of letting differences in wages between abusers and
non-abusers represent loss of production.
<P>
<B>FILLMORE:</B> 
<P>
The methodological problem addressed by [3] Fillmore is the assumption
behind the lost market production figure, $14.9 billion in 1971,
which assumes &quot;...that the difference in family income between
heavy drinkers and moderate drinkers in the work force is due
to drinking...there is an economic cost of abstention since abstainers
also make less than moderate drinkers&quot; (p. 56). Fillmore
points out, that regardless of any weakness in cost estimates
research, the perceived cost to business and industry continues
to rise. Examples given include:

National Council of Alcoholism, 1967, $2 billion<BR>

<B>MILLER AND KELMAN:</B> 
<P>
In hypothesizing models that describe an impairment process due
to ADM which results in income loss, [14] Miller and Kelman concentrate
on the &quot;...achievement of estimates of productivity loss
which are unambiguously attributable to these ADM diagnoses&quot;
(p. 91). The authors assume that the productivity loss from ADM
results in a cost to society and that the forces of competition
cause the value of reduced productivity to be imperfectly reflected
as reduced earnings. Their study gives a technical look at the
specification of various models attempting to estimate these income
differences. By using timing measures they tried to develop a
description of the impairment process leading to income loss that
was closer to <I>cause </I>than association--controlling for all
other factors except impairment.

Their results for alcohol abuse are income losses of:
<P>
over 1% for 18-24 year-old males<BR>
over 9 % for 55-64 year-old males<BR>
1% for 18-24 year-old females<BR>
over 20% for 55-64 year-old females (p. 117-118)
<P>
Their results for drug abuse are income losses of over 1% for
18-24 year old males and over 8.65% for males aged 33 to 54 years;
rates lower than previously reported (p. 125). No income loss
from drug abuse was calculated for women due to a tendency to
under- report drug use and dependency symptoms among women (p.
120).

<B>RASKIN:</B>

In discussing the issues surrounding workplace drug testing, [16]
Raskin cites figures of 55% of $46.9 billion in the U.S. as the
cost in terms of productivity for 1980; rising to $100 billion
in 1986 (p. 48). These figures are from an unpublished report
from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and no information on
methodology or the classification of costs is given.
<P>
<B>RICE. et al.,:</B> 
<P>
For 1985, [171 Rice, et al., give estimates of $80.8 billion for
morbidity costs (the value of reduced or lost productivity), and
$35.8 billion for mortality costs (the value of foregone future
productivity) based on a 6% discount rate and including an imputed
value for housekeeping services (p. 280). Their classification
of costs are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Core costs (resulting directly from ADM)
<UL>
<LI>*direct costs (for which payments are actually made)
<LI>*indirect costs (for which resources are lost)
<UL>
<LI>morbidity (value of productivity lost by those unable to perform
their usual activities or unable to perform at full effectiveness
due to ADM)

from ADM)

<LI>Related costs (costs of secondary, non-health effects of ADM)
<UL>
<LI>*direct costs (for which payments are actually made)

<P>
The estimating procedures for calculating morbidity and mortality
costs are discussed generally and described in detail in appendices
in the full report. Basically, lost income is used to reflect
productivity losses due to ADM (p. 282-283). Other related indirect
costs that were estimated for productivity losses in <I>terms
of lost income </I>include: the cost of persons incarcerated as
a result of an ADM related crime; the cost of victims of crime;
the cost of crime careers in terms of the lost productivity of
people engaged in criminal activity as a result of drug abuse;
and the value of time spent in caregiving for family members with
ADM including loss of work, time spent with lawyers, clergy and
other professionals, loss of recreation and other activities (p.
283-284). Costs excluded due to lack of available data included,
income loss among the homeless, the military, and populations
younger than 18 and older than 64 years (p. 289).
<P>
<B>ZWERLING:</B> 
<P>
In discussing drug and alcohol testing in the workplace, [22]
Zwerling illuminates a relatively recent cost to be considered--the
actual cost of drug testing in the workplace. For example, a $52.4
million expenditure by the military in the U.S. to test 2.9 million
drug screens in 1986 is a significant sum (p. 169). To the extent
this involves a loss of resources to the economy it is a cost.
The fact that the military is a non-market activity does not diminish
the fact that the resources used for drug testing have an alternative
use, and thus are an economic cost. In the private sector there
is pressure to reduce the frequency of screenings in order to
reduce industry costs (p. 170).
<P>
<B>MANNING. et al.,:</B> 
<P>
[11] Manning, et al., looked at the cost of poor health habits
in general (smoking, drinking and sedentary life-styles). They
measured direct costs as lost wages, the portion of health care
costs paid by employees, disability, and premature death. These
were defined as internal costs but the emphasis in the book is
on external costs; what smokers cost non-smokers, what heavy drinkers
cost abstainers or moderate drinkers, and what voluntarily inactive
people cost those who exercise regularly. They cite a figure of
$20.6 billion in lost productivity due to alcohol abuse in the
U.S. in 1985 (p. 3). The $85 billion (1986 dollars) estimated
by Berry and Boland for 1971 and $129 billion (1986 dollars) estimated
by Harwood for 1983 are cited as total external costs, not just
productivity losses (p. 5).
<P>
To emphasize how the use of cost influences calculation, it is
interesting to note that Manning, et al., analyze costs in terms
of cost per unit. This stems from the idea that the &quot;...magnitude
of these external costs can be used to gauge the appropriate level
of excise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes&quot;. This also drives
the inclusion/exclusion factor when analyzing costs. The following
two tables (from p. 6 and 9 respectively) are indications of goals
determining the methodology of the measurement of costs.<HR>

The above estimates were tested using different assumptions and
different data. They fell about midway in the range of estimates
generated by the assumptions of the model. For example, the range
for total external cost per unit of ethanol ranged from l.19 to
1.08 (p. 13-14).
<P>
The conceptual framework for the Manning, et al., study and the
underlying assumptions of the cost analysis apply to the social
costs of each poor health habit. The focus of the analysis was
on the framework's economic efficiency. This involves the concept
of external costs, 'non-drinking drinkers' as the proper comparison
group, and discounted life time costs (p. 26). External costs
are costs imposed on others by heavy drinkers. 'Non-drinking drinkers'
are compared to heavy drinkers in every way (a hypothetical group
who are like heavy drinkers in every way except for the heavy
drinking). By controlling for age, sex, race, education, drinking

<B>FRENCH. et al.,:</B> 
<P>
[4] French, et al., are creative in their use of related data
and statistics. The authors use regression analysis to assess
the impact of drug treatment on clients' employment and earnings.
Their estimates could possibly be used to estimate productivity
costs as measured by lost employment and lost earning of abusers
not in treatment.
<P>
<B>GODFREY:</B> 
<P>
In a technically interesting paper, [5] Godfrey makes the excellent
point that economic models are only as good as the data used to
estimate them (p. 1136). The three phases of modelling she describes
are: (1) specification of the theoretical model; (2) application
of the model to the available data; and (3) validation of the
economic modelling process by statistical testing (p. 1123-1124).
One of the most often overlooked problems starts right at the
beginning of this process. &quot;The bulk of the theoretical and
empirical work undertaken by economists has not focused upon the
special characteristics of the consumption of alcohol and tobacco&quot;
(p. 1136). Economic theories of addiction are under-developed
and need to be communicated to a wider audience. Thus, in any
economic modelling of costing estimates of addictive substances,
broader background issues of theory may require the involvement
of other disciplines as well as the latest economic models of
addiction.
<P>
<B>GODFREY AND MAYNARD:</B> 
<P>
The rationality of the consumer is brought into question by [6]
Godfrey and Maynard. The cost of side effects or personal externalities
should be included in any cost or cost-benefit analysis. To the
extent that it is assumed that heavy alcohol use causes costs
to the consumer, such as illness and premature death, without
any benefit to them, these personal externalities can be seen
as a cost. This is because of the addictive quality of the substance.
If consumers had full information and acted rationally they would
exactly balance their private costs and benefits and no social
costs would be measured.
<P>
<B>HACKER:</B> 
<P>
In assessing EAP's as an early intervention strategy for substance
abuse, [7] Hacker uses contemporary estimates of the costs of
employee substance abuse to American industry. She reports figures
of $50 to $60 billion annually for the mid 1980s, citing some
unfamiliar sources (Backer, 1987; Lewis and Lewis, 1986; Mastrich
and Beidel, 1987; and Montgomery, 1987).
<P>
<B>HARLOW AND SWINT:</B> 
<P>
[8] Harlow and Swint generated technically sophisticated estimates
of changing drug overdose mortality costs. They show that from
1980 to 1986 costs doubled with the greatest growth in mortality
costs coming from narcotics and cocaine; prescribed psychoactive
drug costs stayed relatively constant (p. 165). They cite Berry
and Boland for the estimate of 50% of the total economic cost
of alcohol abuse in the U.S. coming from lost productivity, and
note that the cost &quot;...for abused prescription drugs may
be similar to that of alcohol&quot; (p. 169). This is one of the
few studies that works with licit as well as illicit drug abuse.
The total cost estimates of drug mortality were $69 million in
1980 and nearly $145 million in 1986. The upward trend is male
dominated with about 66% attributable to men in 1980 and rising
to 80% in 1986.
<P>
An earlier paper by the same authors [9] gives the rationale for
omitting intangible losses, the rationale for calculating income
based only on death certificate data, and the rationale for calculating
the productivity of 'housewife services' (p. 79).
<P>
<B>MAYNARD:</B> 
<P>
[12] Maynard raises an important point about the costing of unemployment.
He argues that the idea of limited labour force participation
by drug users reducing national income below its potential has
little merit in an economy experiencing high, or even any, unemployment.
If drug users leave the labour force &quot;...they will be replaced
by the unemployed with little long-term effect on the nation's
output&quot; (p. 249). Of course, as shown in Figure 1 (), the
replacement of employees is not costless to firms in the shorter
term. Recruitment and training use real resources so are counted
as an economic cost.
<P>
Maynard also point out that costs to the economy are different
than adding up costs to individuals due to substance abuse. The
money spent by governments on drug enforcement personnel would
be spent on something else. Thus, the unemployment created by
not employing drug enforcement personnel would be off-set by jobs
created in whatever area the government spent the money. As such,
the net impact on social cost, as a pure economic cost, may be
zero. This idea, and the fact that unemployment rates are significant,
means &quot;...the social cost of drug use in respect of GNP may
be small&quot; (p. 252).
<P>
<B>MCGUIRE AND RUHM:</B> 
<P>
In a study of workplace drug abuse policies, [13] McGuire and
Ruhm cite a 1990 Institute of Medicine study of greater than $33
billion as the annual productivity loss to U.S. employers from
drug abuse. Employers are willing to spend money in two areas.
First, on drug-testing to avoid employing drug-users, and second,
they will spend money on rehabilitation through health care services
(p. 6). Both of these areas are perceived as reducing losses due
to decreased productivity as a result of substance abuse. The
authors point out that the existence of asymmetric information
in the labour market results in the testing becoming a signal
to firms that workers abstain from drugs. &quot;To the extent
these costly signals are acquired without any corresponding increase
in total productivity, overtesting may result&quot; (p. 28). But
because all social costs and benefits outside the labour market
are omitted, their conclusions about too little treatment and
too much testing may be re-enforced by the wider effects of drug
abuse (p. 29).
<P>
<B>NAKAMURA; et al.:</B> 
<P>
In estimating the social costs of alcohol abuse in Japan, [15]
Nakamura, Tanaka and Takano use the method developed by Harwood
(1984) and based on the earlier work of Berry and Boland (1977).
Their categories are core costs (mostly health sector costs) and
other related costs. Each category contains both direct costs
where resources are consumed and some formal payment made, and
indirect costs. However, they note that although &quot;...the
other related indirect costs are comprised of opportunity-lost
costs for victims of crime, crime careers, incarceration, and
motor vehicle crashes, we did not calculate these costs due to
the lack of reliable data sources&quot; (p. 619). This points
out one of the most common problems in trying to estimate some
all-encompassing summation of the costs of substance abuse. Even
when analysis can theorize or identify a cost, actual estimation
of its magnitude is quite problematic either due to lack of data
or the lack of a common unit of account. This paper is good at
showing how actual estimates were calculated and expresses clearly
why these values may be over or under estimated.

<B>SHAHANDEH:</B> 
<P>
In an article about the consequences and countermeasures of substance
abuse in the workplace, [8] Shahandeh does not derive any estimates
of costs but cites assorted studies from several countries for
figures relating to the social costs of alcohol. For example,
&quot;The cost of absenteeism in the United States associated
with drug abuse is estimated to be between $10,000 million and
$20,000 million a year.&quot; These figures are from a 1979 paper
presented at an international conference by A. Honkasalo and M.L.
Honkasalo (p. 208). In other words, rough estimates from assorted
studies are used to give weight to the arguments for the necessity
of treatment and policy. This is one of the pitfalls of the additive
method of costing without knowing the purpose. The figures from
earlier papers are seen and/or added to again and again without
any explanation of how these estimates were calculated and what
criteria was used for the inclusion/exclusion of costs.
<P>
Shahandeh does make an interesting point in stating, &quot;The
cumulative effect of...consequences of substance abuse is a major
consideration in any employer's cost- saving efforts.&quot; (p.
212) An employer's expenses are increased by compensation for
injured workers, by damage to property and equipment, by material
waste from negligence, by increased grievances and deteriorating
working relationships, as well as from decreased output. Even
if the worker is dismissed or resigns there are both apparent
and hidden costs. The obvious costs &quot;...lie in the search,
interviewing, recruitment and training...&quot; as well as the
initial lowered productivity for a new employee, especially an
executive. &quot;The hidden costs relate to the individual skills,
business acumen, knowledge and experience in which the employer
has invested heavily. These costs can be particularly high when
the ex- employee has had access to company information that will
fetch a price and he is hard- pressed enough to sell it in order
to procure drugs.&quot; (p. 212) This may seem far-fetched and
only relevant to a small number of cases, yet the potential is
there, from the company's perspective, for very large, even ruinous
costs to be incurred due to substance abuse from even one key
individual. Another relevant point from the firm's perspective
is &quot;...that while it is to the fiscal benefit of the employer
to save rather than fire the employees, this is only true when
skills not easily replaced are involved&quot; (p. 217).

<B>SINDELAR:</B> 
<P>
In reviewing the book, <I>The Cost of Poor Health Habits </I>(Manning,
et al., 1991), [19] Sindelar points out the controversy over where
to draw the line between external and internal costs. For example,
costs imposed upon family members such as passive smoking and
fires are treated as internal costs, although alternate estimates
are provided if the family-borne costs are treated as external.
The debate centres around &quot;...whether the smoker or drinker
is thought to fully and accurately consider the welfare of family
members in decisions relating to smoking and drinking&quot; (p.
1993-1994). Sindelar's work again serves to emphasize the role
that economic theories of addiction can play in determining what
should or should not be counted as a cost. More developed theories
that treat the consumption of addictive substances as a method
of reducing 'disutility' rather than increasing satisfaction would
tend to treat the effects on other family members as an external
cost rather than an internal cost.
<P>
<B>VAN IWAARDEN:</B> 
<P>
[18] Van Iwaarden points out that <I>any </I>approach to quantifying
costs leads to problems of definition and problems of quantification.
&quot;For instance, how should the loss of a job as a result of
excessive drinking be valued? Is this a cost to the abuser, to
his or her family, to the company where he was working, society
as a whole or to all four of them?&quot; (p. 1207)
<P>
An earlier point about unemployment is reiterated by Van Iwaarden.
If treatment results in a substantial decrease in alcohol consumption
and related problems, how should this be valued? It may be a gain
to society but &quot;...is this surplus labour power, given the
present surplus production and high unemployment, going to be
used in a productive way?&quot; (p. 1207) In spite of this, the
author believes that the bulk of total alcohol-related costs arise
from &quot;...sickness, absenteeism, decreased productivity, accidents
in the workplace, premature disability and mismanagement...&quot;
due to the prevalence of alcohol problems among employees (p.
1208). He does make the important point &quot;...that the extent
of drinking at the workplace is not the most important factor.
The frequency and quantity of drinking in general by employees
is much more decisive&quot; (p. 1208).
<P>
<B>WARNER:</B> 
<P>
In discussing the legalization of drugs, [21] Warner states that
the proponents of legalization argue the &quot;...major costs
associated with illegal drugs are created by the fact of their
illegality&quot; (p. 645). The author also points out that opponents
of legalization talk in terms of eroding the moral fabric of society.
Both of these opposing views are difficult to quantify and even
more difficult to value. In referring to cost-be-fit analysis,
Warner addresses a point that would appear to be relevant to the
costing problems of substance abuse in general. &quot;The most
important limitation of CBA, both in principle and practice, relates
to a different and inescapable problem: how to represent, in the
quantitative calculus of CBA, the existence and importance of
major consequences of drug policies that do not lend themselves
neatly to quantification or valuation&quot; (p. 648).
<P>
Although not strictly in the delineated area of workplace cost,
an illustration of the above idea relating to the value of the
stolen property associated with drug-related crime can show how
broad the cost analysis can become. The stolen &quot;...property
does not cease to exist once stolen; rather it is 'transferred
or redistributed' from its rightful owners to the thieves&quot;.
This is not a social cost but the true cost to society has two
dimensions. The first is its &quot;...psychosocial effect on its
immediate victims and the value of their time devoted to replacing
stolen items.&quot; The deeper second cost is the investment in
home and business protection devices and the &quot;.. .potentially
profoundly important psychosocial costs for those who <I>fear
</I>becoming victims&quot; (p. 64X.
<P>
One could easily extend a cost analysis to cover drug-testing,
development of drug policies, reporting of untoward incidents,
surveillance techniques, and even psychosocial costs, that use
up real resources due to the fear that alcohol or drug consumption
may have untoward effects on the workplace. However, these costs
are even more difficult to measure and to value than the estimates
of lost productivity for example.
<H3><A NAME="causality"></A>6. Causality - the role of substance
use</H3>

<P>
The literature points to the difficulties in distinguishing between
causality and association. On one hand, some studies do not differentiate
prevalence from causality regarding workplace problems. Alternatively,
some studies assume that any level of alcohol/drug use associated
with a workplace problem is enough to assess the cost without
establishing a causal link between these substances and workplace
problems.
<P>
That severe alcoholism and drug use cause physical damage and
are associated with premature death are accepted facts. In terms
of loss of production or fatal and non-fatal accidents, it is
more difficult to assess the causal role of substance abuse because
these events occur for non-abusers as well. And even if causality
had well established parameters, theoretical questions remain
unanswered. Should premature death be counted as a cost? To whom
is loss of production a cost? Moreover, because the effects of
drug and alcohol abuse are cumulative, the causality issue has
to be assessed using relatively arbitrary age categories (i.e.,
20's, 30's, 40's, etc.).
<P>
<B>BERRY AND BOLAND:</B> 
<P>
In a review of research done before their seminal work, [1] Berry
and Boland note that, &quot;On the basis of available research
data, it is not possible to conclude that alcohol is definitely
a causal factor in reducing production. . . [although] . . .there
is certainly an abundance of evidence that reduced production
is related to the alcohol problems of workers&quot; (p. 33). In
focusing on the workers, the authors point out there is no way
of knowing if alcohol in the aggregate is dysfunctional. Even
if alcoholic workers are more costly to a firm than non-alcoholic
workers, one cannot say that without alcohol the alcohol-abusing
worker would be more productive (p. 36).
<P>
In terms of the relative mortality rate of alcohol abusers, Berry
and Boland compared insurance studies, clinical studies, and population
studies (p. 58). They found that alcohol abusers in the various
samples &quot;...had significantly higher rates of death from
the causes usually associated with alcoholism&quot; (p. 61). There
is no doubt that severe alcoholism causes physical ailments associated
with premature death. This information on relative mortality rates
is useful in aggregating lost work years, and interesting in that
it shows the sophisticated level of economic analysis that can
be brought to bear on generating estimates. Nonetheless, it certainly
does not settle the question: Should lost employment due to premature
mortality from substance be counted as a cost to society--especially
in times of high unemployment?
<P>
<B>MANNING, et al.,:</B> 
<P>
Along the same lines, [11] Manning, et al., claim that &quot;...at
age 20, drinkers reduce their life expectancy by 1.55 years or
20 minutes per excess ounce of ethanol consumed per day...[where
an excess ounce is defined as]...the ethanol contained in the
third drink and any additional reported drinks per day&quot;(p.
10). This type of estimate cannot be extrapolated over time, or
to other countries or cultures. Thus, the effect on life expectancy
of an alcohol abuser at age 20 who never takes another drink is
very different from the same scenario at age 40 or age 60. No
matter how accurate alcohol mortality rates are estimated, one
can question whether those premature deaths are a cost. Again,
it must be emphasized how the reason for the assessment of the
cost affects how costs are defined and what costs are included/excluded.
<P>
<B>MILLER AND KELMAN:</B> 
<P>
[14] Miller and Kelman discuss two important issues regarding
estimates of income loss due to ADM disorders. The first issue
is association versus causation, and the second issue is &quot;...obtaining
unbiased estimates of the income differences between groups&quot;
(p. 92). Because the link between income loss and ADM disorders
is &quot;...less immediate and less clear...greater elaboration
is needed to improve the underlying formulation so that it reflects
losses caused by the impairment that follows from these conditions&quot;
(p. 93). This usually involves incorporating a temporal dimension
into the estimate (i.e., to estimate how time since onset affects
income). Therefore, it is important to use longitudinal data to
be &quot;...more confident [that] poor health is actually a cause
of, rather than a mere rationalization for, withdrawal from the
labor force&quot;.
<P>
The models the authors developed &quot;...can be interpreted as
causal models of the impairment process&quot; (p. 93). They are
quite elegant and well-thought out, and the estimates of the parameters
of the four models are presented in extensive tables. The authors
chose the 'best' model for each disorder as the one &quot;...whose
coefficient was most different (statistically) from zero&quot;
(p. 113). The results indicated that &quot;...losses from alcohol
abuse or dependency seem to be a function only of how long one
experiences the alcohol abuse or dependency disorder.&quot; (p.
114-115) The differences in the estimates for men and for women,
and for alcohol abuse and drug abuse are discussed. Because there
was a positive point estimate associated with loss due to drug
use for women, no income loss estimate was calculated. This led
Miller and Kelman to hypothesize that &quot;...there may be greater
stigma associated with substance use by women than by men...so
the tendency to under-report drug use is probably greater for
women. [The combination] of correctly reporting income [and] under-reporting
drug abuse and dependency symptoms is to erase the relationship
between income loss and drug use in the data set.&quot; (p. 120)
This is an important paper for hypothetical models describing
an impairment process that results in income loss, but to whom
the lost income is a cost remains a question.
<P>
<B>ZWERLING:</B> 
<P>
[22] Zwerling questions the causal role of alcohol and drug use
and problems in the workplace. According to Zwerling, early studies
&quot;...are limited by the difficulty in obtaining accurate data
on the prevalence of drug use in the working population. Survey
data are subject to reporting bias if the employee is not confident
that confidentiality will be respected&quot; (p. 169). Problems
also arise in estimation if society's attitude towards drug use
is changing while a study is taking place. The causal relationship
between workplace problems and drug use will be tainted if, in
general, drug use is decreasing in society during the course of
the study (p. 169). The result will be inaccurate estimates of
prevalence and subsequently, inaccurate estimates of causality.
<P>
In discussing drugs, alcohol, and occupational injury, the author
is careful to separate the two related questions of prevalence
versus causality. &quot;First, what proportion of occupational
injuries is associated with drug or alcohol use? Secondly, how
strong is the association between substance abuse and injury?&quot;
(p. 171) Data are relatively easy to collect on the first question
using medical examiners' studies and emergency room population
studies. However, the second question requires the evaluation
of industry-wide studies and population-based surveys.
<P>
In assessing three studies from the late 1980s, Zwerling concludes
that alcohol plays a relatively restricted role in fatal occupational
injuries, especially when compared to motor vehicle and drowning
accidents. In terms of non-fatal injuries, &quot;...the elimination
of all alcohol impairment on the job would only reduce occupational
injuries by about 5%...&quot; in one U.S. study, and by about
7.5% in a French study (p. 174). The same studies show that these
estimates are low compared to transport-related injuries (17.1%
to 30.9%), home injuries (11.3% to 25%) and injuries related to
fights (38.3% to 56.4%) (p. 174).
<P>
It is important to note that acute alcohol impairment is not the
only way alcohol can be related to occupational injuries. If chronic
abuse results in neurological impairment, alcoholics are &quot;...at
risk for occupational injury even when sober.&quot; As well, hangovers
could increase this risk (p. 174).
<P>
Based upon a review of the scientific literature, Zwerling reached
the following conclusions (p.179-180):
<UL>
<LI>Acute alcohol impairment is present in about 10% of fatal
occupational injuries, and about 5% of non-transport, non-fatal,
work-related injuries.
<LI>A history of alcohol abuse may be weakly associated with occupational
injuries (odds ratios ranging from 1.0 to 2.58).
<LI>The wide variety of methodological difficulties in the various
studies of the association between a history alcohol abuse and
occupational injuries should make the reader cautious in drawing
conclusions from the literature.
</UL>

<P>
In contrast no association can be established or ruled out (in
the three studies the author reviewed) between fatal injuries
and drug use, or non-fatal accidents and injuries (p. 181- 182).
<H3><A NAME="attribution"></A>7. Attribution Factors</H3>

<P>
<B>BERRY AND BOLAND:</B> 
<P>
In reviewing earlier research, [1] Berry and Boland cite a federal
comptroller's study that suggests alcoholism prevalence rates
of 4% and 8% of all federal (civilian) employees in the U.S..
Rates of reduced efficiency among alcoholic federal workers were
estimated to be 25% lower. Using 25% of the average annual salary
per employee, and prevalence rates of 4% to 8%, cost estimates
of $275 to $550 million per annum in 1970 were derived (p. 33-34).
These rates were not developed from empirical analyses of behaviour.
The estimates assumed wages paid out but not earned could accurately
measure loss of production. The estimates further assumed &quot;...that
the distribution of alcohol abusing workers among pay scales and
presumably among job assignments was similar to the distribution
of nonalcoholic workers. It is unlikely that the average wage
paid to problem drinkers is more or less equal to the average
wage paid to workers without alcohol problems.&quot; (p. 34) No
attempt was made to assess future costs due to premature death.
Berry and Boland would have liked to measure all of the (discounted)
costs of premature death, and the authors indicate that the unemployment
issue is not addressed: &quot;When an individual dies prematurely,
all of that individual's future production is irretrievably lost
to society.&quot; (p. 35)
<P>
Berry and Boland cite a 1973 study by Pell and D'Alonzo which
found a lower than generally accepted alcoholic prevalence rate
of 1% (rather than 4%) in a specific firm studied (p. 37). These
rates are sensitive to the classifications and definitions used
for alcoholism. Early studies of &quot;...lost production costs
due to premature mortality, unemployment, and absenteeism among
alcoholics...relied heavily on previously published mortality,
occupation and age data for alcoholics and occupational income
data for the general population as a basis for estimating the
present value of reduced earnings due to the premature death of
alcoholics.&quot; (p. 39)
<P>
In an article by Luft (1975), &quot;...the proportion of the gross
difference in earnings that is accounted for by differences in
such factors as age, education, family structure and the like...&quot;
was estimated at 23.9 % . Berry and Boland note that it would
be inappropriate to take the gross difference in income as a measure
of the effect of alcohol abuse on earnings &quot;...since there
is ample evidence that alcohol abusers do not have the same sociocultural/economic
characteristics as non-abusers&quot; (p. 50). The authors used
the 23.9% of the gross difference in earnings between abusers
and non-abusers, then estimated the lower earning due to alcohol
abuse &quot;...as the product of the estimated net difference
in average household income and the estimated number of households
that included an alcohol-abusing male...the lower earnings of
these households due to alcohol abuse represents a reasonable
approximation of the economic cost of lost production due to alcohol
abuse among non-institutionalized males between the ages of 21
and 59.&quot;(p.51)
<P>
In terms of lost production and premature mortality, the authors'
review of previous literature resulted in relative mortality rates
of 2.02 to 2.36 (p. 57). &quot;If alcohol did not contribute to
premature death, alcohol abusers would have the same mortality
rate as non- abusers--that is, their relative mortality rate would
be 1.0&quot; (p. 56). These figures were generated for heavy drinkers
so they cannot be generalized to the overall workplace population.
Berry and Boland also noted that the less restrictive the definition
of alcohol abuse the lower the relative mortality rate, and that
&quot;...alcohol consumption per se is not related to mortality..&quot;
as the highest figures were for heavy drinkers and for younger
frequent drinkers (p. 59). In determining excess mortality due
to alcohol abuse, attribution rates of 6.5% to 7% of all deaths
among males aged 20 to 64 were determined by the authors for 1971
(p. 61).
<P>
<B>GODFREY AND MAYNARD:</B> 
<P>
In developing an economic theory of alcohol consumption and abuse,
[6] Godfrey and Maynard point out the work of epidemiologists
in linking the average level of consumption of alcohol and rates
of alcoholism. &quot;If the relationship between average consumption
and prevalence of excessive drinking only holds in the weak sense,
it is important to consider the use and interpretation of models
of average consumption...economists and others should not be concerned
only with the very small percentage of drinkers who are chronic
alcoholics but with the wider problems of abuse.&quot; (p. 413)
Moderate drinking or specific drinking bouts may cause reduced
productivity-- not just alcoholism per se.
<P>
<B>MANNING. et al.,:</B> 
<P>
In analyzing the cost of poor health habits, [11] Manning, et
al., found that people who practised seven simple personal habits
lived, on average, 11 years longer than those who practised none
of them (p. 2). These authors also noted that people who have
bad health habits may differ in other ways (e.g., less well educated),
and bad health habits are often themselves positively correlated
(e.g., smokers are likely to be drinkers) (p. 6). In deriving
estimates of external costs, Manning, et al., reported lower costs
in lost productivity by those in medical care, &quot;...in marked
contrast to those of Berry and Boland (1977) and Harwood, et al.,
(1984), who reported substantially higher...&quot; lost productivity
costs (p. 129). This is because Manning, et al., treat lost earnings
due to premature mortality as internal costs whereas Berry and
Boland, and most others, treat lost productivity as external costs.
Manning, et al., only included the external costs associated with
sick leave, not mortality `(p. 129).
<P>
<B>MCGUIRE AND RUHM:</B> 
<P>
[13] McGuire and Ruhm separate the hypothetical labour market
into two types of workers (A's and ,B's); those who do not abuse
drugs and those who do, without treatment or deterrent activities.
They point out that each type has a probability of causing a work-related
accident, or lowering production. In this detailed hypothetical
model, the costs of accidents and the costs of any treatment or
deterrent activity are modelled into the labour market productivity
of both groups (p. 11-12).
<P>
This brings to the fore the necessity for estimates of attribution
rates. Even with no alcohol or drug use, accidents will happen
in the workplace and other factors can lower productivity. When
measuring costs, it is necessary to derive estimates of the <I>difference
</I>between accident rates and lost productivity involving substance
abusers versus non-abusers. As it has been noted earlier, actual
alcohol and drug use at the time of an accident is not necessary
to have previous or chronic abuse play a causal role through such
things as hangovers, reduced judgment and decreased coordination.
<P>
<B>MILLER AND KELMAN:</B> 
<P>
In estimating individual productivity loss from alcohol, drug
abuse and mental illness, [14] Miller and Kelman reported alcohol
impairment rates of 1 % to 10% for men, depending on age, and
1 % to 21 % for women (p. 123). They also found drug impairment
rates of l % to 9% for men, and positive coefficients for women
of all ages (p. 124). According to the authors, the positive coefficients
for women suggest &quot;...unmeasured simultaneous effects of
income and prevalence (or the reporting of prevalence)&quot; (p.
125). The actual estimates derived by Miller and Kelman are presented
in extensive tables (p. 103-119).
<P>
<B>NAKAMURA, et al..:</B> 
<P>
[15] Nakamura, et al., used a 21% rate of reduction of productivity
related to alcohol abuse based on attribution rates established
in previous literature, such as Harwood, et al., (1984) which
draws heavily on work by Berry and Boland (p. 618).
<P>
<B>RICE, et al.,</B>:
<P>
This 1991 article by [17] Rice, et al., uses 1988 data to update
estimates derived in 1985. Prevalence and attribution rates were
derived by earlier authors--notably Harwood, et al., (1984), Cruze,
et al., (1981), and Berry and Boland (1977) (p. 281).
<P>
<B>ZWERLING:</B> 
<P>
In an article on drug and alcohol testing in the workplace, [22]
Zwerling concludes &quot;...that relatively little is known about
the role of alcohol and drugs in the workplace. The important
association between substance abuse and occupational injury has
not been established. If there is such an association, it is much
weaker than previously believed&quot; (p. 155). Zwerling also
notes that the findings of different studies are contradictory,
suggesting &quot;...that substance abuse may well play different
roles in different occupational and cultural settings. Thus, caution
should be exercised in transposing results from one setting to
another.&quot; (p. 155)
<P>
The author presents a table of nine studies of alcohol and drug
use among fatally injured workers dating from 1985 to 1993. About
10% had alcohol detected in the blood, but only 7.3% above the
0.08 level (p. 171-172). Another table of ten studies, conducted
in the late 1980s, shows 5% to 10% of non-fatal occupational injuries
were related to acute alcohol impairment (p. 174-175). For non-fatal
occupational injuries, data pertaining to drug use are limited.
One study suggests &quot;...those whose urine tests were positive
for marijuana were found to have a relative risk of occupational
injuries of 1.83% and a relative risk of accidents of 1.55 % .
Those who were positive for cocaine were found to have a relative
risk for occupational injuries of 1.85% and a relative risk of
accidents of 1.59%.&quot; (p. 181) In contrast, another study
found no evidence of an association between injuries and accidents
and marijuana and cocaine use.
<P>
Separate analyses of the transportation sector revealed &quot;...that
alcohol impairment plays a major role in one eighth of accidents
involving heavy trucks that are fatal to the drivers...[while]...there
is no association between marijuana-positive urine samples and
crashes involving heavy trucks that are fatal to the drivers.&quot;
(p. 182)
<H3><A NAME="human"></A>8. The Human Capital Approach</H3>

<P>
All of the literature reviewed in this section assessed premature
death as a cost using the human capital approach. However, a number
of recently published papers (i.e., Collins and Lapsley, 1994)
have used the <I>demographic approach </I>in valuations of loss
of production and mortality. The demographic approach compares
the actual population with a hypothetical non-abusing population.
In the human capital approach, the loss of productivity is quantified
in terms of a discounted stream of future earning on the assumption
that the loss of average wage is a reasonable approximation of
the value of lost output. While the fine points of both approaches
may be discussed extensively, the more basic question is whether
to count lost production as a cost.
<P>
<B>BERRY AND BOLAND:</B> 
<P>
[1] Berry and Boland view lost productivity as an external cost,
and the &quot;...loss of productivity...is generally quantified
in terms of discounted earnings, on the assumption that average
wages are a reasonable approximation of the value of the lost
output.&quot; (p. 3) This is an example of the human capital approach.
<P>
The authors conclude that &quot;...when an individual dies prematurely,
all of that individual's future production is irretrievably lost
to society&quot; (p. 35). These costs are allocated to the year
of death using the present value of future costs by discounting
those costs at some social discount rate (p. 35). This approach
assumes society would gain if alcoholics did not die prematurely
but rather lived to produce at the same rate as non-alcoholics.
Society would also gain if unemployed alcoholics returned to the
labour force to produce at the same rate as non-alcoholics (p.
40-41).
<P>
In their analysis of costs, Berry and Boland include an estimate
&quot;...of the present value of the lost future production as
the discounted stream of future earnings that these workers might
have been expected to earn if they were not alcohol abusers and
had not died prematurely&quot; (p. 56). To formulate this estimate,
it was necessary to ascertain how many people died in a given
year who would not have died if they had not been alcohol abusers,
and without alcohol abuse, how many more productive years would
those persons have had. The answers were found by using mortality
rates for males due to heavy drinking, grouped by age and by assuming
an age 65 retirement standard. The productive man-years lost were
derived by assigning survival probabilities of an age cohort in
the general male population to excess mortality. The social discount
rate used to calculate present value was 6%. Information from
an earlier, unrelated study (1975) on lifetime earnings by age,
sex, race and education level was used to complete the calculation.
<P>
<B>HARLOW AND SWINT:</B> 
<P>
In analyzing the economic effects of drug overdose mortality over
a seven year period, t8] Harlow and Swint include lost productivity
due to premature death as an economic cost to society. &quot;To
estimate the economic loss associated with these deaths, the human
capital approach was employed, and the income that society will
forego due to premature deaths was estimated.&quot; (p. 169) A
6% discount rate was used, but estimates of lost earnings were
based on those developed by Rice, et al., (1985) by sex a~ age
interval. These were multiplied by the number of cases for the
corresponding age interval and sex for each drug category. The
total costs for each drug category by sex were then estimated
by summing across age intervals (p. 169).
<P>
<B>HEIEN AND PITTMAN:</B> 
<P>
[10] Heien and Pittman include the loss of life of innocent victims
as an external cost to society. The authors considered the loss
of life of the abuser to be a private cost, but &quot;...loss
of life is an external cost only for third-party victims, such
as those killed by drunken drivers. Similar conditions apply to
morbidity costs&quot; (p. 304). As such, a fatal occupational
accident is not a cost if only the abuser is killed; if a co-worker
or other third party is killed then the loss of this life is a
cost which can be valued in two ways:
<P>
The first is the human capital approach &quot;...where value of
life is computed as the discounted value of the expected future
earnings of the individual&quot; (p. 304). This traditional method
is the legal norm but some drawbacks are listed by the authors:
&quot;...it must use some subjectively determined interest rate
to make the calculation, does not reflect the individuals' attitudes
towards risk and often lacks adjustments for payments into and
withdrawals from social insurance funds&quot; (p. 304).
<P>
The other approach is the risk-based 'willingness to pay' method
which asks, &quot;How much would an individual be willing to pay
for a small reduction in the probability of being killed in a
certain set of circumstances?&quot; There are two problems with
this approach. First, responses to this type of hypothetical question
are not based on actual behaviour so the data collected may lack
meaning. Second, empirical estimates using this type of perspective
show a great deal of variation (p. 304).
<P>
<B>MANNING. et al..:</B> 
<P>
In considering long-term effects, [1] Manning, et al., use a 5
% (real) discount rate for calculating future costs such as pensions,
and in looking at policies with long-term effects (p. 7-8). The
cost of premature death to the smoker and the individual's family
is considered an internal cost, and the cost to the individual's
co-workers and others is considered an external cost. This is
due to the fact that the economic unit being considered is the
family as it pools income (p. 28-29). In considering lifetime
costs and discounting, the authors compute results for rates that
range from zero to 10% &quot;...because the proper rate of discount
is controversial...&quot; (p. 30). This addresses the problem
of cost estimates being sensitive to the chosen rate for discounting,
but makes it more difficult to assign one value for costing purposes.
<P>
<B>NAKAMURA. et al..:</B> 
<P>
In estimating the social cost of alcohol abuse in Japan, [1S]
Nakamura, et al., used the human capital method to estimate the
alcohol attributable mortality costs of the present amount of
lifetime economic value based on age, sex, and labour force participation.
The present amount of lifetime economic value was determined by
the sum of income and economic value of housekeeping services
discounted at a 6% rate. This method was based on the work by
Rice, et al., (1985) and Hodgson and Meiners (1982) (p. 620).
<P>
<B>RICE. et al.,:</B> 
<P>
[171 Rice and her colleagues explain the human capital approach
as follows: &quot;According to this approach, a person is seen
as producing a stream of output that is valued at market earnings
or the imputed value of housekeeping services. The approach is
based on a social perspective and has the advantage of using data
that are reliable and readily available the value of human life
is based on market earnings, and pain and suffering are not taken
into account.&quot; (p. 281) The discount rate used for assessing
mortality costs as irretrievable loss of production was 6% in
a 1985 study by Rice, et al., so it can be assumed that this update
to their earlier work used the same discount rate-- although the
rate was never actually given in the article.

This section contains a considerable amount of information about
other factors relevant to estimating the costs of substance abuse--in
general, and in the workplace. The salient points can be categorized
into two main types of issues. Type one includes those narrower
issues that are concerned with the actual methodology in estimating
cost. Type two includes those much broader issues concerning the
nature of substance abuse and what constitutes a social cost.

<B>FILLMORE:</B> 
<P>
In a conceptually important paper, [3] Fillmore states, &quot;Perhaps
one of the gravest problems of the attempts to determine costs
in the occupational alcoholism field, regardless of methodology,
is the variability of operational definitions surrounding the
dependent variable.&quot; (p. 57) For example, diagnosed alcoholics
and general measures of 'problem drinkers' are not the same subset
of the population. Thus, epidemiologists need to not only find
or estimate prevalence, but also discover the nature of the problem
itself (i.e., not only the predictors and correlates of substance
use as the dependent variable, but also the nature of the dependent
variable). This would seem to indicate a need for a &quot;...disaggregated
approach to the study of the behavior related to alcohol abuse
and potential cost&quot; (p. 57). Cultural stereotypes versus
the medical model, punitive versus benevolent social institutions,
addiction versus dependence--all these historical developments
plus the idea that alcohol use covers a large continuum of behaviours
resulted in the need for &quot;...a dividing line that could be
operationalized and deployed in the field [instead of a] graded
estimate of the alcoholics' personal responsibility&quot; (p.
57).
<P>
Fillmore also suggests that research undertaken &quot;...on subcultural
drinking patterns of white collar workers may be a promising direction...&quot;
as is the study of the role that workplace structure plays in
the development of individual alcohol problems and problems that
affect society as a whole (p. 59).
<P>
<B>GODFREY:</B> 
<P>
An issue brought forward by [5] Godfrey is the link between the
use of various substances such as alcohol and tobacco, or alcohol
and other drugs (p. 1129). The author points out that the choice
of whether to consume or not and the choice regarding what quantity
to consume can be regarded as independent decisions. These would
be two separate estimates in any model (p. 1130). The author also
points out that economists and others have a &quot;...growing
interest in the importance of taste changes in understanding demand
behaviour [which has] led to the specification of habit formation
models in which current levels of consumption depend on past consumption
decisions&quot; (p. 1130).
<P>
In some models, actual consumption is a weighted average of desired
and past consumption. In others, the coefficient of lagged consumption
indirectly measures the habit effect. The result is &quot;...that
the existence of some degree of addiction may result in consumers
responding asymmetrically to changes in price and income changes&quot;
(p. 1131). Differences in short-run and long-run elasticities
for addictive and non-addictive goods and &quot;...recognized
features of addiction behaviour such as binges and abrupt discontinuities...&quot;
are consistent with well-developed economic theories of addiction
(p. 1131). Godfrey also lists some interesting work on models
linking consumption, health behaviour, and health outcomes (p.
1132). These have implications for policy, especially regarding
taxation.
<P>
<B>GODFREY AND MAYNARD:</B> 
<P>
t6] Godfrey and Maynard point to the need for measures of average
consumption; the level of which is a concern for a wide variety
of professionals. They cite J.C. Duffy (1977) who argues &quot;.
..that the use of preventive policies designed to change average
consumption could only be justified if all consumption could be
viewed as a public health hazard.&quot; (p. 413) They also point
out that economic addiction models show that &quot;...consumers
may have a tendency to acquire a habit at times of low prices
or high income and be reluctant to abandon it when prices rise
and income falls.&quot; (p. 419) Because the methodology available
to economists is limited, the authors suggest &quot;...there is
a need for more data collection, repeated statistical testing
of models, and periodic surveys of the state of the art to enable
some assessment of the contribution of economic theory to studies
on alcoholism.&quot; (p. 425) Other research into the effect of
socio-demographic variables (such as religion, urbanization and
education, as well as unemployment and tourism) on substance use,
especially using disaggregated analyses, is also recommended (p.
429-430).
<P>
Godfrey and Maynard make the important point that, &quot;...demand
studies may give some indication of the effectiveness of various
prevention policies but the evaluation of the efficiency and social
desirability of such policies requires an analysis of their costs
and benefits. &quot; (p. 431) They also suggest that a multidisciplinary
approach is required where the discipline of economics can make
two significant contributions: &quot;...(1) by providing a normative
framework for dealing with alcohol use and misuse and for establishing
the appropriate role of government in this area; (2) by providing
specific tools, particularly econometric model and cost-benefit
analysis, for evaluating effectiveness and efficiency of government
programs and policies aimed at reducing alcohol related damage.&quot;
(p. 432) This approach requires strong links between economic
and epidemiological theories, and links between economic techniques
and other theories of behaviour (p. 432).
<P>
<B>MAYNARD:</B> 
<P>
In discussing the economics of drug use and abuse, [12] Maynard
points out that choices about competing policies &quot; . . .
should be informed by data about costs and benefits at the margin-that
is, if activity increases by a small amount, how do costs and
benefits change?&quot; (p. 244) This assumes that the objective
of the government is the efficient use of resources.
<P>
The author also points out that conventional, (neoclassical) economic
theory ignores the impact of the addictive nature of certain substances.
This leads to the need for more precision in the use (and abuse)
of the term 'addiction'. &quot;Without such precision in definition,
supported by good science, the neoclassical case remains a relevant
basis for informing choices and doubting the efficiency of existing
policies.&quot; (p. 250) The issue for public debate is what type
of policies are the most cost-effective in reducing the harms
created by drug abuse. &quot;Unfortunately, many of these harms
are poorly identified, let alone valued.&quot; (p. 251) Although
it is known that individual markets for drugs are interdependent,
estimates of cross-elasticities to demand to show the extent to
which products are substitutes or compliments are extremely difficult
to measure without reliable data (p. 245). Government regulation
is deemed necessary if users behave in such a way that imposes
harm on others in society. It is this type of third party effect--including
lost production--that is an important cost to society. Because
of the illicit nature of many substances, confidentiality problems
result in under-reporting, poor responses, and a general lack
of reliable data.
<P>
<B>MCGUIRE AND RUHM:</B> 
<P>
In their highly theoretical modelling of labour market equilibrium,
[13] McGuire and Ruhm evaluated drug-testing as a deterrent, a
signal, and a sorting mechanism. They felt that &quot;...despite
the increased importance of workplace drug policies, there has
been little attention devoted to their market-wide impact and
to the implication for public policy&quot; (p. 6). Because drug
use is viewed as having a 'disease' component, the role for deterrence
is limited and implies a need to consider the effects of adverse
selection in focusing &quot;...on the workers' choice of engaging
in treatment or deterrent activities which would reduce the cost
of drug use&quot; (p. 7). Because it is unclear to what extent
substance use is a choice and &quot;...to what extent it should
be considered a possibly time-varying endowment (like health)
over which the individual has no control. . . &quot; it is difficult
to make the choice of economic model. &quot;If the use of drugs
is similar to the consumption of other types of goods, individuals
will respond rationally to rewards and penalties which are put
into place. Conversely, if there is a substantial disease component,
efforts to deter use or to pass the costs on to the individual
abuser will be less successful.&quot; (p. 10) It may be more realistic
to minimize the costs of behaviour by using external interventions
such as subsidized treatment or by placing individuals where damage
associated with drug use is limited.
<P>
Because firms cannot hold workers strictly liable for drug related
expenses, &quot; . . .companies may attempt to use contractual
arrangements whereby the actions of employees reveal their type...&quot;
(p. 10). These arrangements could include multi-period contracts
with the posting of bonds (in the form of reduced wages), a variety
of single- period contracts where pay is contingent on accident
outcomes, and drug-testing with treatment benefits whose costs
are paid by all employees (p. 10-11). Although drug testing can
be socially inefficient if there is no cost-saving it does serve
to sort workers into types: those willing to be tested to signal
they are drug-free, and those unwilling to be tested. If those
two types of workers have different productivity levels (i.e.,
the unwilling are assumed to have lower productivity and/or more
accidents as a group due to possible drug use and impairment of
work activities), this sorting will increase output of firms thus
reducing the workplace costs of drug use (p. 21-23).
<P>
The authors raise a number of potentially important theoretical
extensions of their work: &quot;...(1) recognizing the potential
deterrent effect of testing and selection effect of treatment;
(2) considering labour market equilibria when testing and treatment
take place simultaneously; (3) expanding the admissible form of
wage contracts; (4) including more realistic descriptions of testing
and treatment; and (5) considering multi-period models where workers'
drug use is integrated into a utility framework. For future empirical
work, the most important question concerns the relative importance
of carrots and sticks to deter and treat worker drug abuse.&quot;
(p. 29)
<P>
<B>MILLER AND KELMAN:</B> 
<P>
[14] Miller and Kelman note that in studies of workplace costs
of ADM disorders, &quot;.. .the effects of reduced work, labor
skill, and motivation on the return to capital and/or the rate
of profit are ignored&quot; (p. 91). Another area for concern--in
earlier works by Harwood (1984) and Cruze (1981)--is the specification
of the relation between household income (not earnings) and measures
presumed to influence income characteristics and substance use
(including education level and occupation). An estimate on the
indicator of impaired group membership is used to represent the
average percentage difference in income between groups, controlling
for personal characteristics (p. 92). The authors are concerned
that this methodology creates biased estimates &quot;...when membership
in an impaired group is indicated in an income model and the [right
hand side] omits factors that correlate with both income levels
and group membership&quot; (p. 94). This results in estimates
that &quot;...show a larger loss than actually caused by an alcohol-related
impairment to productivity.&quot; (p. 94) Miller and Kelman recommend
that because occupation is jointly determined by education and
income, and because education is affected by the early onset of
ADM disorders, &quot;...an unconstrained reduced form equation
is estimated with omitted education and occupational variables...&quot;
to solve the simultaneity problem (p. 94).
<P>
Miller and Kelman point out the interesting differences in the
results of estimating procedures for men and women. They postulate
that &quot;...a possible sociological basis for men being described
by current effects and women being described by current plus future
effects is that alcohol abuse or dependence is less culturally
acceptable for women than for men. Stigmatization influences assignment
and responsibility and, hence, productivity. When women stop drinking
the stigmatization also ends as cultural knowledge indicates that
when drinking stops normal economic behavior can resume.&quot;
(p. 116-117)
<P>
In comparing different studies, a note of caution is included
by these authors. First, because different studies use different
disorder definitions and aggregations, their numerical results
are difficult to compare. Depending on whether a restrictive or
more relaxed definition of prevalence is used, impairment rates
(thus measurement of costs) will differ. Secondly, studies can
use different specifications; &quot; . . .the process translating
disorders into productivity loss was exogenous to the analysis&quot;
(p. 123). Their suggestions for areas of further research include
the methodology of translating disorders by group membership into
measures of impairment, and the &quot;...combining of appropriate
specification of the ADM impairment process with systems of simultaneous
equations to correct simultaneity bias&quot; (p. 125).
<P>
<B>NAKAMURA. et al..</B>:
<P>
Besides estimating the economic burden of alcohol abuse on Japanese
society, [15] Nakamura, et al., &quot;...discuss the need for
public health intervention as a means to alleviate the burden
of alcohol abuse on society from a socioeconomic as well as health
perspective.&quot; (p. 618) The authors also point out a cultural
difference in specification of alcohol attributable percentages
in different disease categories. &quot;In Japan, prevalence rates
for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis resulting from Hepatitis
B virus are high; therefore, for Japanese population, alcohol
attributable percentages for this category are lower&quot; (p.
623). This reiterates the dangers of transposing one culture's
rates to another, yet the authors themselves do precisely that.
They &quot;...speculated that the percentage of problem drinkers
among [the] working population is higher than in the general population...&quot;
but used the U.S. figure of 21% as the value of reduced productivity
due to the unattainability of reliable percentages of problem
drinkers among all working populations (p. 623).
<P>
Unfortunately this is a common pattern in the literature, especially
in studies whose goal is to estimate some kind of additive cost
of alcohol/drug use, both in the workplace and in society in general.
Data collected for other reasons, incomplete data, the use of
prevalence and attribution rates from earlier sources, and little
discussion of methodology concerning the inclusion versus exclusion
of different types of costs appear to be the rule in the studies
reviewed, rather than the exception.
<P>
<B>RASKIN:</B> 
<P>
In discussing the moral, ethical, and legal issues of drug and
alcohol testing, [16] Raskin points out that there has been almost
no investigation of the psychological impact of testing procedures
in the workplace (p. 51). The author feels definitions of risk
should be developed and asks &quot;...whether risk should be limited
to physical injuries or whether it should also encompass risk
to the profitability of the enterprise, including such factors
as company reputation and customer trust.&quot; (p. 75) The question
of when a person is impaired is also worthy of study. &quot;In
examining a possible codification of workplace impairment, consideration
should be given to the question of whether impairment should be
job-specific or at a set threshold level for all occupational
groups.&quot; (p. 75)
<P>
<B>RICE, et al..:</B> 
<P>
[17] Rice, et al., note that, &quot;ADM disorders are not neatly
segregated among prevalent persons. Drug abusers often abuse alcohol,
and conversely, and both types of substance abusers have higher
than average rates of mental illness.&quot; (p. 282) Thus, there
is a problem of how to allocate income loss attributable to multiple
disorders among the disorders present. Can measurable interaction
effects of overlapping disorders be identified? The problem encountered
in determining the answer includes collinearity in regression
analysis by including additional variables (p. 282). The model
used by Rice and her colleagues assumed that the effects of overlapping
prevalence were additive but not interactive (p. 283).
<P>
The need for standardization and guidelines for costing estimates
is emphasized by these authors. They note the &quot;...considerable
variation among studies in the distribution of direct and indirect
costs and in the level of costs in studies for the same years.
These variations are from the use of different methodologies,
estimating procedures, sources of data, and discount rates.&quot;
(p. 289) A problem also arises with costs that are known but excluded
due to lack of reliable data (e.g., income loss among transient
and homeless people, military populations, and institutionalized
populations) resulting in under-reporting of costs (p. 289). Rice,
et al., call for special attention to be &quot;...given to improvement
of data collection, analysis, and evaluation to provide reliable
and timely information for policy use&quot; (p. 290).
<P>
<B>WARNER:</B> 
<P>
In using economics in the discussion about legalizing drugs, [21]
Warner talks about the use of sensitivity analysis as one of the
critical design features of cost-benefit analysis. &quot;...sensitivity
analysis entails varying the values of uncertain parameters to
determine whether the uncertainty significantly affects the qualitative
findings of the analysis.&quot; (p. 651) He also suggests that
a comparison of approaches can illuminate critical issues in developing
refined and less biased estimates of the health effects of legalization.
&quot;...the disparity in estimates thus itself serves to refine
the research agenda...&quot; (p. 652). Perhaps &quot;...establishing
a forum for an adversarial proceeding featuring the competing
analysis...would utilize the reality of the current environment
of analysis....and by making the competition explicit, might produce
new insights where they are sorely needed.&quot; (p. 652) Although
Warner refers to studies of drug legalization, all the above could
easily apply to costing analyses of ADM in general and workplace
costs in particular.
<P>
Warner also addresses the issue of consumer rationality and economic
theories of addiction (theory of rational addiction) as developed
by Becker and Murphy (1988) (p. 653). An interesting difference
in the consumption of drugs versus alcohol is noted. Various studies
of alcohol link consumption, especially workplace consumption,
with availability, but the same may not be true of illicit drugs;
&quot;...the thrill of engaging in illicit behavior may entice
more people to use drugs than the fear of illegality discourages
from use.&quot; (p. 655)
<P>
In addition to data problems with illicit drugs exceeding those
associated with virtually all legal consumption activities, &quot;...the
intangible consequences of drug policy, the ethical and philosophical
dimensions, play a substantial role in the big picture&quot; (p.
657). There is a need to distinguish drug policy costs and benefits--major
consequences that are in principle quantifiable and those that
are not--and then identify the monetary valuation of those that
are amenable to this procedure. &quot;At best, cost benefit analysis
can help to frame the policy debate, to place the moral and philosophical
issues explicitly in a context in which they can be compared and
contrasted with the more prosaic economic implications...[but]...economic
analysis cannot negate the ultimate need for reliance on a political
and bureaucratic decision-making process to deal with the challenging
ethical, social, legal and political issues that pervade the problems
of drugs in America. Economists will never captain the ship of
drug policy, but they might help to chart the course. &quot; (p.
658)
<P>
<B>ZWERLING:</B> 
<P>
In discussing drug and alcohol testing in the workplace, [22]
Zwerling points out the dangers of adopting drug testing programs
just because 'everyone else is doing it'. Unique work conditions,
business needs, and mode of operation all need to be considered.
&quot;Drug testing is not the solution to drug problems. It is
only a piece of technology that supplies information for making
intelligent decisions.&quot; (p. 169) The author notes while &quot;...education
and employee assistance are more powerful than drug testing...a
value system that does not tolerate substance abuse and a capable
EAP are the only means to deal with substance abuse issues&quot;
(p. 168). Cost-benefit analysis can play a role in proving/disproving
general sweeping statements such as these. The author himself
suggests that only randomized, controlled studies would help answer
the question whether drug testing in the civilian workforce is
effective in reducing drug usage (p. 170). He notes that the great
increase in the amount of drug testing in the U.S. is largely
in response to federal regulations which have produced an entire
industry of drug testing. Because recent data suggests that drug
usage is beginning to decline, the focus will likely switch from
illicit drugs to alcohol as strong economic interests advocate
testing expansion. He suggests three lessons in analyzing future
trends and policy concerns: (1) humility in the face of sparse
empirical data; (2) attention to variation among different industries;
and (3) the importance of the prevalence of drug use in cost-benefit
analysis (p. 189).
<P>
<B>BERRY AND BOLAND</B> 
<P>
Given that contemporary economic costing of alcohol abuse started
with [1] Berry and Boland, it is fitting to conclude this section
of the review with their powerful statement:
<P>
&quot;It is important to restate the general principle that reliable
cost estimation in the alcohol field depends not only on economic
analysis but also on what is known about the social and economic
behavior of people with alcohol problems. At present, the necessary
process of integrating knowledge and data from such diverse fields
as alcohol research, economics, other social sciences, and the
health sciences is just beginning. In time, as a better understanding
is gained of the role of alcohol in affected social behavior,
the magnitude of the economic consequences of alcohol abuse will
be estimated more precisely.&quot; (p. 47)

<H4>10.1 Points to Consider</H4>

<P>
Workplace costs should be delineated from other (non-workplace)
costs. There are costs which are unique to the workplace, and
these should be estimated separately. Examples include replacement
hiring and retraining, pre-employment drug testing, and employee
assistance programs.
<P>
Many issues cannot be adequately analyzed by looking at costs
in isolation from benefits or 'utility'. The issue of worker utility
is central to the study of the economic effects of substance abuse.
A substance abusing worker may not impose costs on the firm or
other members of society. He/she may be replaced immediately.
However, there is a loss in quality of life due to being fired,
to being addicted, and to dying. If we ignore lost benefits in
the analyses, a critical component will be omitted. The concept
of cost is not broad enough to answer all <I>economic </I>questions.
<P>
The important impacts of substance abuse on the employer have
largely been ignored. Costs due to drug testing, employee assistance
programs, and worker replacement have not been factored into the
analysis. However, these are real costs, that use real resources,
and could be quite considerable. They should be analyzed.
<P>
More attention should be placed on identifying when an employer
loses value added, and what portion of value added is a cost to
the employer.
<H4>10.2 The Role of Economic Theory</H4>

<P>
In reviewing the literature, one cannot stress enough the importance
of two key points. First, the purpose of the costing study matters.
Second, the choice of economic model matters. This is the reason
why any review of the past literature will reveal a jumble of
contradictory definitions of costs, what items actually are and
are not a cost, which costs matter to society, and which costs
are only of concern to the individual. The lack of consensus is
more than just a matter of straightening out definitions and setting
some global guidelines and then watching each costing analysis
fall into place. Without a good theoretical foundation and without
a reason for engaging in the costing exercise, any analysis is
doomed to errors in judgment, if not errors in technique.
<P>
The actual analytical techniques are quite straightforward; the
hard part is choosing what to analyze. Just making a list of all
the items that anyone in this diversified field would conceivably
consider a cost (i.e., see Table 1, 3) and finding a way of estimating
a figure for that item would not add to our understanding of the
magnitude of the problem in the workplace; nor would it be useful
in any political or budgetary planning framework. This type of
exercise lacks credibility, not only because it overstates costs
and/or double counts costs, but because there is no theoretical
underpinning to the work. There is no foundation upon which to
build a solid, thought-provoking structure that will help to illuminate
the magnitude of the costs of substance abuse in the workplace
or in a broader framework.
<P>
Until recently, all cost analyses were based on what economists
call the 'neoclassical model' of consumer choice. An individual
purchases a good or service. There are costs involved. The most
obvious is the actual purchase price, but there is also the time
and effort involved in making the purchase and the time and effort
involved in making the decision about what, how much, when, and
where to make the purchase. The reason why all these are considered
costs is because they each have a 'next-best' alternative use
called an 'opportunity cost'. The dollars used in the purchase
can be used for different purchases. The time and effort used
in decision-making, selection and actual purchase of the good
or service can be used in other ways. Although the alternatives
may seem infinite, only one is the 'next best' use of the resource--that
one is the opportunity cost. For example, you are at the supermarket
choosing which can of soup to buy. Your choice depends on price
(and taste) because all the other opportunity costs are the same
for each type of soup once you are already shopping. We let the
difference in price reflect the <I>difference </I>in opportunity
cost between each type of soup because all other opportunity costs
are the same.
<P>
In neoclassical microeconomic theory it is assumed that the total
costs of the individual's purchase are equal to the total benefits
(often called utility or satisfaction) the individual receives
by using or consuming the purchase. This is referred to as consumer
equilibrium. In a neoclassical model, any drug or alcohol purchase
and use, legal or illegal, is assumed to be equal to the benefit
the individual receives by consuming the purchase. The consumer
is assumed to be aware of all the costs and all the benefits of
the purchase and use of the alcohol and/or other drugs. As the
private cost is assumed to equal the private benefit, there is
no external cost to be considered. The purchase price, time and
effort involved in purchase and use, as well as any other costs
such as reduced wages and even reduced mortality rates are all
private costs, with no part considered an external cost-- unless
of course a third party (not the seller or purchaser) is affected.
<P>
In economic models of addiction, the neoclassical idea of private
costs equal to private benefits, satisfaction or utility, no longer
applies. Alcohol and drug abuse is analyzed differently than other
consumption decisions because these goods are of a different nature.
If the consumption is an addiction or even a strong habit, the
purchase does not serve to increase the benefits, utility, or
satisfaction of the consumer. Instead, it is used to <I>reduce
</I>the level of disutility or dissatisfaction or negative benefit
that prior use has established. Thus, there is a cost to the individual
without an equal offsetting benefit. Any lost wages, premature
mortality and morbidity are counted as external social costs.
Some would even argue that the actual cost of the alcohol and
drugs should be included as a social cost.
<P>
The same argument applies to the decision about which economic
unit to use in measuring costs. The neoclassical economic model
has traditionally counted the entire family as an economic unit
called a household. By assuming knowledge of all the various long
and short-term costs and benefits, any negative effects on the
family by the abuser are supposedly taken into account by the
individual's decision regarding the consumption of alcohol and
drugs. Therefore, costs to non-abusing members are not counted
as external costs.
<P>
In the addiction model, the individual is the economic unit and
any costs that are incurred by the non-abusing members of the
household or family are counted as external costs and are relevant
to any study of costs of substance abuse. For example, lower wages
would affect the standard of living of the non-abusing members,
as would premature mortality and morbidity so these would be part
of the costs of alcohol and drug use in the workplace--even if
the consumption did not necessarily take place on the job.
<P>
In reviewing the literature and talking to people in various fields
it becomes clear that in some industries (such as transportation)
<I>any </I>substance use can be problematic. In all industries,
problems can be caused by consumption of drugs or alcohol even
when a severe addiction or actual use on the job site is not the
issue. Habits of episodic and binge use of alcohol and drugs can
have a negative impact on the workplace. The economic models of
addiction can apply to any analysis of drug and alcohol use that
has any effect on job performance or productivity because these
models remove the assumption of full knowledge of the individual
of the present and future effects or costs of alcohol and drug
use. Social costs are incurred in these models by individuals,
their families, and their employers, even without clinically defined
alcoholism or drug addiction.
<P>
In terms of workplace costs of alcohol and drug use to the employer,
the neoclassical economic model and economic model of addiction
start to converge. In both models anything that uses resources
such as drug testing or EAP's has an opportunity cost (i.e., those
resources could be used for the next best alternative) and are
counted as a cost. The only difference is that if the individual
personally pays for some portion themselves, that portion is a
private cost which is assumed to be offset by some portion of
the private benefit, and not considered a social cost in the neoclassical
model. In the economic addiction models, both the employer and
the employee portions are counted as social costs as there is
assumed to be no private benefit from the use of alcohol and drugs
that affect job performance.
<P>
A minor but important point is that magnitude is not the deciding
factor on whether certain items such as drug testing or EAP's
(or recruiting and training of replacement employees) are to be
counted as costs. If resources are used they are costs. For example,
there would be a vast difference in the cost of drug testing in
the United States versus other countries, but because of the underlying
economic principles, whatever the magnitude, resources are being
used and thus costs are incurred. As drug and alcohol testing
technology develops, more employers may be persuaded to implement
testing. The economic model can accommodate this because the principle
has already been established.
<P>
The same analysis applies to productivity losses occurring because
of alcohol and drug use. The only difference between the models
is the proportion allocated to the individual as a private cost
and to the employer as a social external cost. Again, in the economic
models of addiction, all productivity losses are counted because
of the lack of off-setting economic benefits to the individual.
In the neoclassical model, the part of the loss of productivity
that reduces wages of abusing individuals is considered a private
cost and not counted.
<P>
There is, however, a bit of a complication in the mortality issue
in the neoclassical model. If the prematurely deceased (or even
dismissed) abusing individual is replaced (i.e., the non-full
employment model) only the cost of replacement is counted; not
the discounted value of lost earnings. Loss of earnings is seen
as a private cost under the assumption of full information. Only
if-the individual was not replaced (i.e., the full-employment
model) would both the replacement costs and the discounted value
of lost earnings be counted as a social cost. In the economic
models of addiction, both would be counted and the issue of full
employment or unemployment does not arise.
<P>
An important point raised in many of the articles reviewed and
part of Berry and Boland's seminal work, is the idea that there
is a close economic link between productivity and wages. The amount
that an individual adds to the production of goods and services
(i.e., their marginal product) is theoretically related to their
wages. The difference in wages between abusing and non-abusing
individuals, when other factors such as age, sex, education, etc.,
are taken into account, can represent the loss of productivity
to firms. Basic economic theory shows that what is a cost to firms
(wages) is income to households or the individual. To try to get
a physical measure of the loss of productivity and also count
reduced wages to abusers would definitely be double counting.
This problem again is easily avoided by using sound economic principles
in any costing analysis.
<H3><A NAME="conclusion"></A>11. Conclusion</H3>

<P>
Although strong arguments can be presented for each case, we would
recommend using the economic models of addiction rather than the
older, more basic neoclassical model. The neoclassical model is
extremely useful in explaining the consumption of ordinary goods
and services by rational consumers. Just as one would not use
this model to explain the behaviour of irrational, or obsessive
compulsive individuals, it is a poor second choice for analyzing
the abuse of drugs and alcohol because of the special characteristics
of these goods. The economic unit should be the individual, as
real costs are incurred by non- abusing members of the household.
We would, however, draw the line at trying to include the actual
purchase price of drugs and alcohol as a social cost.
<P>
Issues regarding the assessment of workplace costs are summarized
in the Figure 2 (9). As outlined, it emphasizes the importance
of deciding upon:
<UL>
<LI>The economic model used to build the framework of workplace
cost assessments;
<LI>The decision regarding which economic unit is being used in
measuring costs (i.e., the household or the individual or even
the employer alone); and
<LI>The assumption about unemployment in determining the inclusion/exclusion
of mortality costs.
</UL>

<P>
An additional consideration is the budgetary impact of transfer
payments such as unemployment insurance benefits, disability payments
and social assistance programs. These are not workplace costs
of substance abuse but do have a budgetary impact for governments
and agencies, and do reduce the disposable income of non-abusing
employees.<HR>

<H3><A NAME = overview></A>Overview</H3>
Together, the social partners - employers, workers and their representatives, and 
governments - should assess the effect of drug and alcohol use in their workplaces.  If they 
conclude that a problem significant enough to require action exists, they should jointly 
consider the range of appropriate responses in light of the ethical, legal and technical 
issues enumerated in this document.<P>
A comprehensive policy to reduce the problems associated with alcohol and drug use may 
cover employee assistance, employee education, supervisory training, information and 
health promotion initiatives, and drug and alcohol testing.  A workplace drug and alcohol 
testing programme is technically complex and should not be considered without careful 
examination of all the issues involved.<P>
When a testing programme is being considered, a formal written policy should be 
developed indicating the purpose for testing, rules, regulations, rights and responsibilities 
of all the concerned parties.  Drug and alcohol testing, as part of a comprehensive 
programme, should be based on the greatest possible consensus among the parties 
involved in order to ensure its value.<P>
<H3><A NAME = background></A>Background</H3>
Reliable analytical methods now exist to detect substances in breath and bodily fluids and 
tissues.  These substances include alcohol as well as other drugs.  To ensure programme 
success, the methods of detection to be used must be of the highest quality and reliability, 
taking into consideration the purpose of the test.  Although the number of competent 
laboratories is growing, it is recognized that in many nations such facilities do not exist.  
Policies should therefore be developed to take this into account.<P>
There are two categories of tests: screening and confirmation.  The screening test 
constitutes a rapid but initial stage of the process.  However, in the event of a positive test 
result, confirmatory methods should be used to verify the results.  Some legally prescribed 
drugs may, under certain conditions, be misidentified as illicit substances.  Under these 
conditions, a correct interpretation of the test results is imperative.  This highlights the 
need for high standards not only in technical equipment but also in the training and 
qualifications of personnel.<P>
It should be recognized that current methods of drug and alcohol testing may involve 
invasive procedures, which may constitute a risk as well as an intrusion into privacy.  In 
addition, costs for a well-designed drug and alcohol testing programme vary and it is 
recognized that these may be considerable.  It is therefore imperative that these issues be 
fully considered prior to implementation of any alcohol or drug testing programme.<P>
<H3><A NAME = assessing></A>Assessing the 
relationship of drug and alcohol use and the 
workplace</H3>
The assessment of problematic use  reflected in the workplace should recognize the 
inherent national, social, cultural, ethnic, religious and gender variables that will affect not 
only the mode and meaning of use but also the behavioural outcomes evidenced by use.  
The nature and significance of problematic use must be carefully evaluated.<P>
It is also important to recognize that people often use multiple drugs.  Those substances 
may include, but not be limited to, alcohol, prescribed or over-the-counter medications 
and illicit or controlled substances.<P>
In addition to the need for a sensitive instrument to assess problematic use of various 
substances as reflected in workplaces, the <I>significance </I>of those defined problems 
must be assessed.  Is it a health, safety, disciplinary or other issue?  The identified 
problematic use should be considered with respect to all of the relevant issues.<P>
<H3><A NAME = effectiveness></A>Effectiveness of 
drug testing</H3>
The scientific evidence linking the use of alcohol and drugs to negative consequences 
in the workplace is equivocal.  Most evidence, so far, is anecdotal and inferential.  Studies 
are lacking on whether testing programmes reduce possible work difficulties resulting 
from alcohol and drug use.  The available data do not produce sufficient evidence to show 
that alcohol and drug testing programmes improve productivity and safety in the 
workplace.<P>
Alcohol and drug testing only recognizes the use of a particular substance.  It is not a valid 
indicator for the social or behavioural actions caused by alcohol and drug use.  No 
adequate tests currently exist which can accurately assess the effect of alcohol and drug 
use on job performance.  There are correlations between behavioural effects and blood 
alcohol concentrations but there are variances among individuals.  Such correlations have 
not yet been demonstrated for urine alcohol concentrations, blood drug concentrations or 
urine drug concentrations.<P>
<H3><A NAME = outcomes></A>Programme 
outcomes</H3>
The manner in which organizational, local, national and international drug and alcohol 
policies and practices are mutually influential is poorly understood.  The implementation of 
a successful policy in one country may have unintended consequences in other countries.  
Programmes which provide benefits in specific countries may have adverse consequences 
for other jurisdictions.  Since the world is becoming more closely linked by the existence 
of multinational corporations and international trade agreements, for example, countries 
and work organizations should examine more closely the international impact of their 
initiatives.  Drug and alcohol policies must be individualized to meet the needs of 
particular users.  One locality's policy cannot meet all users' needs.<P>
Concern about the consequences of drug and alcohol use in the workplace should be 
addressed in a comprehensive strategy.  If testing is considered as one of the elements in a 
comprehensive strategy, the intended outcomes as well as unintended effects should be 
considered.  Review of these effects can assist in the decision to include or remove testing 
from a programme strategy.  If testing is to be included, this review can assist in 
determining the nature and extent of the testing to be carried out.<P>
Some of the intended outcomes may include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Assistance in the development of a comprehensive programme to improve safety and 
security as well as to reduce potential liabilities.
<LI>A comprehensive productivity and quality assurance programme including reduction 
of absenteeism.
<LI>Some of the unintended outcomes may include:
<LI>Deterioration of work environment through fear, mistrust, polarization between 
management and workers, lack of openness and social control.
<LI>Not following legal and ethical rules.
<LI>Breaches of confidentiality.
<LI>Adverse effects on individuals from test errors.
<LI>Decrease in security of employment.
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME = legal></A>Legal and ethical 
issues</H3>
There are ethical issues of fundamental importance in determining whether to test for 
drugs or alcohol.  Is testing warranted?  If so, under what circumstances?  Recognizing 
that the situation differs in each country and each workplace, ethical issues are one of the 
most important concerns to be resolved before any testing is undertaken.  Rights of 
workers to privacy and confidentiality, autonomy, fairness and the integrity of their bodies 
must be respected, in harmony with national and international laws and jurisprudence, 
norms and values.  Workers who refuse to be tested should not be presumed to be drug or 
alcohol users.<P>
The need for testing should be evaluated with regard to the nature of the jobs involved.  
With some jobs, the privacy issue may be determined to outweigh the need to test.<P>
As a protection to workers, positive test results should be subject to independent medical 
review.  For those workers whose positive test results reflect problematic drug or alcohol 
use, participation in a counselling, treatment or self-management programme should be 
encouraged and supported.<P>
Various national laws, customs or practices may require the accommodation of employees 
who test positive by referral to treatment, assignment to other work or other means that 
assure security of employment.<P>
Specific procedures should be developed which demonstrate a programme's capacity to 
comply with existing national laws and regulations.  Such regulations may include:<P>
-Legislation on workplace drug and alcohol testing<P>
-Labour law<P>
-Medical confidentiality laws<P>
Drug and alcohol testing must be placed within the larger context of the moral and ethical 
issues of collective rights of society and enterprises, and individual rights, as embodied in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international labour standards.  (See 
Appendix 3 for relevant text of Universal Declaration and ILO standards.)<P>
Other rights are also important:  Examples here are the right to choose one's own 
physician, the right to representation if needed, the right to notification that testing will be 
carried out as part of a pre-employment screening programme and the right to information 
on test results.<P>
It is assumed that the participants in any work situation have rights and responsibilities 
which may have been agreed upon.  Drug and alcohol testing programmes should fit 
within existing arrangements for ensuring the quality of work life, worker rights, the safety 
and security of the workplace, and employer rights and responsibilities (e.g. protection of 
the public interest).<P>
Programme organizers should be sensitive to the potential for any adverse consequences 
of testing (e.g. harassment, unwarranted invasion of privacy).  Workers should have the 
right to make informed decisions about whether or not to comply with requests for 
testing.<P>
Safeguards should be installed to eliminate any potentially discriminating impact 
from testing.  The testing programme should be conducted in a nondiscriminatory manner 
in compliance with the appropriate legislation and regulations.  In those jurisdictions with 
constitutional rights to work, efforts should be made to enable the person to remain in the 
workforce.<P>
<H3><A NAME = orgdev></A>Programme organization 
and development</H3>
<H4>Setting up a programme</H4>
Where problems in workplace performance exist, a number of responses may be 
considered.  If the problems are related to the effects of alcohol and drug use, the balance 
of the corrective strategy should lean towards education and prevention.  Partners in the 
workplace must consider whether employee assistance programmes are available within 
the enterprise, through the union or external associations in the community at large.<P>
Assistance programmes should be voluntary, broad brush approaches which are capable of 
addressing a wide range of wellness issues.  If drug testing is an option within the 
assistance programme, a number of methods exist including pre-employment, post-
accident, for cause, reasonable suspicion, post-treatment, random or voluntary testing.<P>
In any case, drug testing should be viewed only as part of a systematic approach which 
includes assessment, information on the effects of various levels of substance use, 
education concerning the elements of a healthy lifestyle and a programme of reintegration 
into the workplace for problematic drug or alcohol users.<P>
The response selected must be directly related to the workplace problems to be addressed.  
The objectives to be met by the testing programme must be clearly defined and articulated.  
Before drug testing is selected as an appropriate response, there must be clear evidence 
that testing can reasonably be expected to achieve its intended goals.<P>
In this context, it is especially important to determine that the technical capacity for state-
of-the-art testing procedures exists and is used.  Analysis of test results must take into 
account the differences between alcohol and other drugs.<P>
<H3><A NAME = statement></A>Programme policy 
statement</H3>
The written policy should detail the procedures to be adopted by the testing programme 
and these should be agreed upon by all the social partners.  The policy should clearly 
identify the purpose of testing and the uses for the results.  It should indicate any laws or 
regulations concerning drug and alcohol testing that may apply.  If needed, a summary 
statement could explain how the programme intends to comply with those laws or 
regulations.<P>
It should emphasize worker rights, employer rights, public rights and individual rights.  
It should identify the substances to be tested for and how these substances will be 
detected.  It should describe the testing method and the relevance of that method to the 
results.  It should explain the laboratory procedures and the analytical methods used by the 
laboratory.  It should detail how the testing programme is to be organized, the level of 
administrative support required, the technical expertise needed and who will carry out the 
tests and with what equipment.<P>
Any changes to the policy, because of new conditions or other substances being sought, 
should take place with the agreement of all the social partners.<P>
<H3><A NAME = admin></A>Administrative 
structure</H3>
The testing programme's administrative structure, areas of responsibility and lines of 
authority should be clearly delineated in written form and available.  A specific 
organization officer should have primary responsibility for the programme's operations.  
The manner in which the testing programme fits within the organization's larger 
administrative structure should be clearly stated.  The qualifications of programme 
personnel should also be clearly stated.<P>
Administrative procedures should be established to ensure due process.  These procedures 
should address the status of the tested individual and the responsibility of the organization 
during the time that test results are being analysed.<P>
<H3><A NAME = 
confidentiality></A>Confidentiality</H3>
Standards to protect the privacy of the workers and to ensure the confidentiality of test 
results should be specified.  Among the steps that should be taken:<P>
<OL>
<LI>The identity of the worker should be kept confidential.
<LI>The records concerning the worker should be kept in a secure location.
<LI>Separate authorization by the worker should be obtained before the release of each 
test result, specifying the tested substances.
<LI>Signed authorization to divulge a worker's information to third parties should name 
the specific individual(s) who will receive the information.
<LI>A separate authorization should be obtained for each intended recipient of 
information about the worker.
<LI>Authorization forms should be witnessed.
<LI>Policies concerning the confidentiality of the testing programme should be 
communicated to relevant parties.
</OL>
<H3><A NAME = linkages></A>Programme 
linkages</H3>
A mechanism should be in place for communicating test results to the tested person.  
Appropriate mechanisms should be established to allow that person to be referred for 
assistance when indicated and when the person consents.<P>
<H3><A NAME = options></A>Policy 
options/purposes</H3>
The purposes of any drug and alcohol testing programme should be specified<P>
in writing.  Among the most common purposes given for testing programmes are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Investigations of accidents and incidents
<LI>Referral for assistance
<LI>Deterrence
<LI>Meeting legal and regulatory requirements
<LI>Communicating an organization's policy
</UL>
The form of drug and alcohol testing in a particular programme should be explicitly tied to 
the purposes of the programme.  For example, many forms of testing may be adopted to 
meet regulatory requirements.  Although there may be some disagreement regarding the 
value and utility of any particular form of testing, it seems that:<P>
-For cause, reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing are most clearly linked to 
investigative purposes.<P>
-Pre-employment, post-assistance monitoring and voluntary testing may be most 
appropriate if the organization wishes to refer persons who have been identified as drug 
and alcohol users for assessment and consultation.<P>
-Pre-employment, random, transfer, promotional and routine scheduled testing may be 
compatible with deterrence purposes.<P>
It is imperative to establish written criteria governing when to apply one of the options 
listed above.  In addition, the frequency and duration of testing assigned as part of 
assistance monitoring and/or a return to work programme should be prescribed in the 
overall testing policy.  When a pre-employment test is utilized, it may be part of a 
comprehensive medical examination used to determine fitness for work.<P>
<H3><A NAME = determining></A>Determining which 
drugs to test for</H3>
Decision-making on testing should be flexible and existing conclusions reviewed 
periodically.  Decisions to test for alcohol and drugs should be made only when reliable 
and valid initial and confirmatory testing services or facilities are available.  These facilities 
should protect confidentiality and, for forensic purposes, ensure the chain of custody.  All 
positive results should be confirmed prior to notification or any other action.<P>
Several criteria should be considered in selecting which substances to test for:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The prevalence rates and the consequences of use in the workplace.
<LI>The likelihood of harm to health due to use of various substances.
<LI>The likelihood of substance use affecting work-related behaviour.
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME = evaluation></A>Programme evaluation 
and review</H3>
Ongoing evaluation and review are essential to ensure that, a testing programme is able to 
attain the objectives for which it was established.  The plan for monitoring and evaluation 
should be set out when a testing programme is designed.<P>
The evaluation plan should:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Be based upon the written goals and objectives established for the programme.
<LI>Identify means to determine whether or not the programme is being implemented as 
intended.
<LI>Establish criteria and mechanisms for determining the impact and effect of the testing 
programme.
</OL>
Evaluation plans should adhere to acceptable standards.  Results of evaluations should be 
made available to all relevant parties.<P>
<H3><A NAME = technical></A>Technical and scientific 
issues</H3>
In many parts of the world no programmes exist for the accreditation of testing 
laboratories.  In order to ensure the highest accuracy and reliability of the testing 
programme, standard operating procedures should be in place to document the manner in 
which specimens are handled, instruments are checked for proper functioning and quality 
control is carried out.  Accuracy and reliability must be assessed in the context of the total 
laboratory system.  If the laboratory uses well-trained professional personnel who follow 
acceptable procedures, then the accuracy of results should be very high.<P>
The working group recognizes that national and international standards are lacking.  
It recommends that the ILO consider using such standards as those developed by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse and the College of American Pathologists as a basis for 
developing international standards.<P>
Extreme caution must be exercised in the testing procedures.  Testing specimens beyond 
the authorized list of drugs for other types of analysis (e.g. HIV, other disease criteria or 
pregnancy) should be expressly prohibited.  Additionally, the possible impact of a positive 
result on an individual's livelihood or rights, together with the possibility of a legal 
challenge of the results, should set this type of testing apart from most clinical laboratory 
analysis.  All workplace alcohol and drug testing should be considered as a special 
application of analytical forensic toxicology.  That is. in addition to the application of 
appropriate analytical techniques, the specimens must be treated as evidence and all 
aspects of the testing procedure should be documented and available for examination.<P>
The purpose for which testing is conducted will often dictate the specimen of choice.  
Typically blood is examined when impairment issues are addressed and urine is examined 
when drug use is being questioned.  In many countries the law may require consent prior 
to submitting to the sampling procedure.  Before any sample is collected the employee 
should be informed as to the collection procedure, the drugs that will be tested for, the 
associated medical risk and the use of results.  Provisions should be made for the 
protection of the personnel responsible for specimen collection.<P>
At present urine appears to be the best specimen for analysis in the context of detecting 
drug use in the workplace.  Specimen collection procedures should be done in such a way 
that the privacy and confidentiality of the donor is protected as well as the integrity of the 
specimen.<P>
Blood can be used to detect the presence of alcohol and most drugs.  However, the 
invasiveness and discomfort of the sampling procedure and the requirements for a trained 
phlebotomist and provision for emergency medical assistance makes blood a less desirable 
specimen for workplace testing.<P>
In terms of testing for alcohol, the breath is the most commonly used specimen.  
Equipment is readily available and breath can be collected in a noninvasive manner.<P>
At this time, insufficient data exist to support a recommendation for an alternative 
specimen such as hair, sweat or saliva.<P>
Initial screening and confirmation methods must be based on different principles of 
analytical chemistry or different chromatographic separations.<P>
Quality assurance and quality control protocols should be in place before the initiation of 
the analytical procedures.  These procedures should encompass all aspects of the testing 
process, from specimen collection through reporting of the results and final disposition of 
the specimen.  Quality assurance procedures should be designed, implemented and 
reviewed to monitor each step of the process.<P>
A positive result does not automatically identify an individual as a drug user.  The 
results should be reviewed, verified and interpreted by a medical expert.  Prior to making a 
final decision, the medical expert would check all medical records, examine alternate 
medical explanations for a positive test result and conduct a medical interview with the 
individual (including the individual's medical history).  This would determine whether a 
confirmed positive could be explained by the use of a legally prescribed medication.<P>
Before making the final interpretation of the test result, the individual should be given the 
opportunity to discuss the test results with the medical reviewer.  If there is a legitimate 
medical explanation for the positive test, the result should be reported as negative and no 
further action should be taken.<P>
<H3><A NAME = 
recommendation></A>Recommendations for action and 
research</H3>
The expert working group recommends that:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Research should be undertaken to evaluate the relationship between use of drugs and 
alcohol and job safety and productivity.
<LI>Research should be initiated to evaluate the costs and benefits of testing programmes.  
Evaluations should be done to study the costs and benefits for each of the parties, 
including social, economic and psychological costs and benefits.
<LI>The ILO should consider the need for developing international standards for drug 
and alcohol testing and laboratory certification.

<H3><A NAME = preface></A>Preface</H3>
Alcohol- and drug-related problems may arise as a consequence of personal, family or 
social factors, or from certain work situations, or from a combination of these elements.  
Alcohol- and drug-related problems not only have an adverse effect on the health and 
well-being of workers, but may also cause many work-related problems including a 
deterioration in job performance.<P>
Given that there are multiple causes of alcohol- and drug-related problems, there are 
consequently multiple approaches to prevention, assistance, treatment and 
rehabilitation.<P>
While the elimination of substance abuse is a highly desirable goal, experience has shown 
the difficulty of achieving this goal.  Therefore, recognizing the role the workplace can 
play in assisting individuals with such problems, a focus on managing alcohol- and drug-
related problems, including the use of illegal drugs, would seem to yield the most 
constructive result for workers and employers alike.<P>
In accordance with the decision taken by the Governing Body of the ILO at its 
259th Session (March 1994), a meeting of experts was convened in Geneva from 23 to 
31 January 1995, to consider a draft Code of Practice on the management of alcohol- and 
drug-related problems at the workplace.  The meeting was composed of seven experts 
appointed following consultations with governments, seven following consultations with 
the Employers' group, and seven following consultations with the Workers' group of the 
Governing Body.<P>
The practical recommendations of this Code of Practice are intended to provide guidance 
to all those who have responsibility for addressing alcohol- and drug-related problems at 
the workplace.  The Code is not intended to replace international standards, national laws, 
regulations or other accepted standards.  Alcohol and drug policies and programmes 
should apply to all staff, managers and employees and should not discriminate on grounds 
of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.<P>
Local circumstances, particularly legal and cultural attitudes towards alcohol and drug use, 
as well as financial and technical resources, will determine how far it is practicable to 
follow the provisions of this Code.  This Code should also be read in the context of the 
conditions in the country proposing to use these recommendations.  With this in mind, the 
needs of developing countries have been taken into consideration.<P>
The following constitute the key points in the Code of Practice on the Management of 
Alcohol- and Drug-related Problems:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol and drug policies and programmes should promote the prevention, reduction and 
management of alcohol- and drug-related problems in the workplace.  It applies to all 
types of public and private employment including the informal sector.  Legislation and 
national policy in this field should be determined after consultation with the most 
representative employers' and workers' organizations.<P>
<LI>Alcohol- and drug-related problems should be considered as health problems, and 
therefore dealt with, without any discrimination, as any other health problem at work and 
covered by the health care systems (public or private) as appropriate.<P>
<LI>Employers and workers and their representatives should jointly assess the effects of 
alcohol and drug use in the workplace, and should cooperate in developing a written 
policy for the enterprise.<P>
<LI>Where it is indicated that certain job situations contribute to alcohol- and drug-related 
problems, employers, in cooperation with workers and their representatives, should do 
what is reasonably practicable to identify and take appropriate preventive or remedial 
action.<P>
<LI>The same restrictions or prohibitions with respect to alcohol should apply to both 
management personnel and workers, so that there is a clear and unambiguous policy.<P>
<LI>Information, education and training programmes concerning alcohol and drugs should be 
undertaken to promote safety and health in the workplace and should be integrated where 
feasible into broad-based health programmes.<P>
<LI>Employers should establish a system to maintain the confidentiality of all information 
communicated to them concerning alcohol- and drug-related problems.  Workers should 
be informed of exceptions to confidentiality which arise from legal and professional ethical 
principles.<P>
<LI>Testing of bodily samples for alcohol and drugs in the context of employment involves 
moral, ethical and legal issues of fundamental importance, requiring a determination of 
when is it fair and appropriate to conduct such testing.<P>
<LI>The stability which ensures from holding a job is frequently an important factor in 
facilitating recovery from alcohol- and drug-related problems.  Therefore, the social 
partners should acknowledge the special role the workplace may play in assisting 
individuals with such problems.<P>
<LI>Workers who seek treatment and rehabilitation for alcohol- or drug-related problems 
should not be discriminated against by the employer and should enjoy normal job security 
and opportunity for transfer and advancement.<P>
<LI>It should be recognized that the employer has authority to discipline workers for 
employment-related misconduct associated with alcohol and drugs.  However, 
counselling, treatment and rehabilitation should be preferred to disciplinary action.  Should 
a worker fail to cooperate fully with the treatment programme, the employer may take 
disciplinary action as considered appropriate.<P>
<LI>The employer should adopt the principle of non-discrimination in employment based on 
previous or current use of alcohol or drugs, in accordance with national law and 
regulations.<P>
</UL>
If use of drugs and alcohol related to the workplace is found after assessment to cause a problem, then for purposes of this document it is 
considered to be "problematic use".  In addressing the use of alcohol and drugs in the workplace, this document does not intend to encourage 
illegal behaviour.

Abuse</H4>
This monograph summarizes a meeting between the Research Advisory Groups of the Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse (CCSA) and the National Native Alcohol and Drug Addictions Program (NNADAP). 
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal addiction specialists from across Canada met to discuss the use and abuse 
of alcohol and other drugs in First Nations communities. <P>
For many years we've known that substance abuse devastates Aboriginal communities across Canada. 
Over and over again, we read about young people in places like Davis Inlet (Labrador) or Attawapiskat 
(Ontario) who turn to solvent use, and sometimes suicide, to deal with the hopelessness of their lives. In 
an effort to address the conditions that give rise to substance abuse, government subjects Aboriginal 
people to a never ending barrage of epidemiological studies and social surveys. Yet an explanation of the 
under-lying causes of substance abuse among First Nations people eludes us still.<P>
Clearly, this fundamental gap in knowledge about a high-risk population prevents the development of 
strong and effective substance abuse programs. Substance abuse is only a symptom of deeper individual 
and community problems. For programs to be successful, they should be part of a more general plan to 
build healthy, confident communities. Employment, education, recreation and family-centred initiatives 
(among others) are critical to the well-being of all segments of the Aboriginal population. Prevention, 
education and treatment programs can be effective only under stable and supportive conditions. Better 
information about Aboriginal substance abuse generally, and community problems specifically, may show 
where meaningful local action may be taken to promote healthy environments. <P>
How can problems in Aboriginal communities be handled differently? What role can alcohol and other 
drug research have in making these changes? What kind of information is needed by communities to 
answer the hard issues about local use and abuse of various substances? A variety of suggestions were 
made at this meeting. These are included in the following chapters.<P>
The CCSA and NNADAP participants agreed that non-Aboriginal researchers and government personnel 
rarely have sufficient knowledge of Native ways to investigate substance abuse problems or develop 
programs to address them. Yet many outsiders continue to define community problems and conduct 
research without substantial input from the communities themselves. To make matters worse, these studies 
are rarely used to develop local programs. Communities must be empowered, through training and expert 
support, to undertake these activities on their own. Partnerships between community health professionals 
and addiction specialist, for example, may ensure that issues are framed to suit local needs and used to 
plan local initiatives.<P>
This volume presents the proceedings of the CCSA/NNADAP meeting. A brief description of the 
principles of native science opens the series to set an appropriate context for the papers that follow. The 
first report, by Kim Scott, reviews Canadian research on Aboriginal substance abuse and highlights gaps 
in our information about individual and community problems that must be filled: a host of issues are 
identified that demand resolution. Next, the group discussion is summarized. Topics such as etiology, 
investigative techniques, locus of control and the role of Alcoholics Anonymous in Native recovery are 
explored. One key issue surfaced: although we know that violent and abusive lifestyles are widespread in 
some communities, we cannot explain why certain communities have problems and not others, whether 
there are inherent similarities among these communities, or if they differ on some level when socio-
economic status is considered. <P>
Some members of the CCSA Research Advisory Group prepared commentaries in response to the 
meeting. Dr. Tom Storm, a sociologist, observed that ". . . little of what I know on this topic is applicable, 
even by extrapolation, to the Native context". Several Aboriginal problems differ from those in the general 
Canadian population. Aboriginal substance abuse appears to be more complex than the general Canadian 
population: ". . . substance abuse not only contributes to social problems in Native communities, but also 
is the result of the conditions they create". He questions the relevance of scientific approaches that 
examine cause and effect to Native problems, and speculates about the factors that contribute to them.<P>
Patricia Erickson, a criminologist with the Addiction Research Foundation, offered a harm reduction 
approach for Native communities. Alcohol and other drug problems may be more costly and problematic 
for the communities at large than for individual use alone. Mary Jane Ashley, Professor of Preventive 
Medicine at the University of Toronto, discussed fetal alcohol syndrome within the context of the drinking 
norms of Aboriginal communities. Keen community awareness, education programs and early 
identification of high risk women may be the most effective ways to reduce the incidence of FAS/FAE in 
this population.<P>
The last piece is a "Plan of Action to Improve Information and Research on Native Substance Abuse in 
Canada". The CCSA and NNADAP Research Advisory Committees jointly agreed to develop a network of 
alcohol and drug specialists to help communities develop and evaluate community programs. <P>
How can substance abuse problems in First Nations communities be effectively addressed in the future? 
Richard Jock, Director of the Assembly of First Nations, spoke about Aboriginal substance abuse and ways 
the problem was addressed in the past. He expressed hope that First Nations communities and alcohol and 
drug researchers would build partnerships. He cautioned, however, that for Aboriginals and non-
Aboriginals to talk about the critical issues, "there is no need for you to be more Native than the Natives. 
We just need your advice to solve our own problems, in our own way." Our panel agreed that Aboriginal 
communities must be empowered to solve their own problems  _ with the assistance of addiction 
specialists if they wish. We can, and must, work together. The CCSA/NNADAP joint meeting showed 
that successful partnerships are possible."<P>
I hope that this monograph is the first of many useful conversations between First Nations representatives 
and addiction specialists across Canada.<P>

<H5>Introduction</H5>
This report, prepared for the National Native Alcohol and Drug Addiction Program (NNADAP) and the 
Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA), focuses on the addiction patterns of Indigenous Canadians 
with only marginal reference to American statistics to illustrate the similarity of circumstance. The paper 
was prepared with an academic audience in mind and is limited in its content by its reliance upon written 
work. The Canadian Indigenous context is described as heterogeneous, oppressed colonialized states with 
high rates of poverty, and physical and social distress. Etiological theories of addictions in Indigenous 
groups within the frameworks of history, genetics, economics and culture are discussed. The most reliable 
epidemiological data are violent mortality rates that reveal consequences of addiction in the Indigenous 
community are severe especially for the young. Across age and gender groups, Canadian Indigenous 
groups are roughly 3-4 times more likely to die violently than their mainstream counterparts. Children 
and youth account for much of this elevated risk. NNADAP is briefly described and data from its regional 
needs assessments as well as its treatment activities reporting system are presented. Consistently, alcohol 
is the substance of choice in the institutionalized group. Males are over represented in every region; 
however, a narrowing discrepancy between the genders was noted with westward movement and roughly 
one-third of the treatment group has relapsed. Surveys indicate that tobacco is used more often than 
alcohol. <P>
Indigenous young people have a greater lifetime prevalence and earlier age of onset for substance abuse 
than their mainstream counterparts; most strikingly for smokeless tobacco and solvents. Substance use 
appears to increase with age in adolescent years and is strongly related to peer influence. Fetal alcohol 
syndrome (FAS) and the milder form, fetal alcohol effects (FAE), are at epidemic proportions. 
Community-based efforts in addiction programming are highlighted with some discussion of prohibition. 
Urban Indigenous populations, whose addiction patterns and consequences are similar to those on reserve, 
are largely unserviced due to culturally and linguistically insensitive provincial programming and poorly 
funded Friendship Centre networks.<P>
Politico-legal complexity, the irregular application of federal policy across the country, lack of scientific 
rigor, non-generalizability of findings and language barriers pose significant challenges in this research. 
In the future, solutions to these problems must be found with the complete, egalitarian participation of 
Indigenous groups. Nicotine, alcohol and cannabis must become the focus while profiling specific target 
groups. Moreover, the happy marriage of Western and Indigenous sciences must be ensured to advance 
knowledge about the addiction patterns of Indigenous peoples. Problems must be identified with the goal 
of empowering the addicted. <P>
<H5>Background</H5>
In the past, Indigenous groups epitomized the state of human health and harmony with the environment. 
Systems of government and kinship adequately supported the group but, with the encroachment of foreign 
economic, political, social, educational and religious systems, dysfunction and captivity resulted. In 
Canada, this situation is framed in the Indian Act (1876) (1). The dysfunction is most evident in addictive 
behaviours and their consequences. This document highlights community-based and scientific research in 
the addictions field with specific regard to Canadian Indigenous people. The Indigenous context, 
etiological theories, epidemiological strategies and Indigenous Canadian addictions organizations are 
briefly described. Discussions on the institutionalized, urban and community-based situations are 
presented as well as special issues such as FAS, solvent use and age and gender differences. The 
limitations of current findings and recommendations for future research are discussed.<P>
The most recent census data indicate that 711,720 Canadians claim Indigenous origins representing about 
3 per cent of the Canadian population: 50.9 per cent are female (2). Although phenotypically similar, 
Canada's Indigenous population is composed of an extremely heterogeneous group with 10 major 
language categories, 58 different dialects as well as extreme variability in Euro-Christian mixing and 
contact as well as self-identification. The three major categories by which Canadian Indigenous people 
identify themselves are Indian, Métis and Inuit. There are 573 settlements recognized by the Department 
of Indian and Northern Affairs (DINA) which includes only Indian and Inuit groups. Approximately 60 
per cent of the total recognized population lives on these Crown lands. Unfortunately, the majority of the 
data and text of this report excludes the Métis situation as they are largely ignored by DINA as well as 
Statistics Canada. Métis settlements, especially those neighbouring reserves, are similar to their federally 
recognized counterparts.<P>
Indigenous communities range in population and structure from virtual air station outposts with 50 people 
to elaborate urban centres with 6,000 or more. The population is younger due to a lower life expectancy 
(about 10 years for each sex), and greater fertility rates (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Compared to Canadians generally, 
residents of Indigenous communities have a greater risk of tuberculosis, diabetes, suicide, violent death, 
alcohol-related traumatic injury and illness, infant mortality (3, 4, 5, 6), high school drop-out, teen 
pregnancy, state care, impoverishment, incarceration, unemployment, poorer educational attainment, 
substance abuse, decreased life expectancy and illness due to poor housing and sewage (2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 
9).<P>
Communicable disease is coming under control and overall health status has improved in the last 15 
years. Improvements in some health conditions and a reduction in the potential years of life lost has 
occurred as a result (5, 10, 11). However, Indigenous groups still show higher age-standardized death 
rates for respiratory, circulatory, gastrointestinal and infectious disease, injury and poisoning, as well as 
parasitic infection (5). In most cases the risk of death by specific cause is 2-4 times greater in the 
Indigenous population than for the mainstream Canadian population.<P>
The Indigenous family has experienced increases in nuclearization, divorce rate, births outside marriage, 
child wardship, adoptions and adoptions of Indigenous children by Euro-Canadian families (4, 12). 
Indigenous children are placed in provincial care at five times the national rate. Twenty five to 35 per cent 
of all Indigenous children become provincial wards or are adopted by Euro-Canadian families (4). 
Indigenous families have substantially more single parents, and fewer married couples without children 
(12). Twenty-five to 50 per cent of all Indigenous children grow up in single parent families (4, 12, 13, 
14).<P>
Unemployment in any given Indigenous community ranges from 10-98 per cent, and less than 5 per cent 
still participate in traditional subsistence modes (2). Less than 50 per cent of all households have central 
heating and approximately 40 per cent have no indoor bathroom (4, 8, 15). According to the most recent 
census, 70 per cent of those persons claiming to be of Indigenous origin have not completed high school. 
When Indigenous populations are compared to their mainstream counterparts, the following demographic 
profiles resulted.<P>

Indigenous groups are less likely to be employed, married, attain a basic secondary education and be free 
of abject poverty than mainstream Canadians.<P>
<H5>Substance Abuse</H5>
There is a growing body of research in the Indigenous and scientific community which describes 
addictions among Canadian Indigenous groups. Federally sponsored, unpublished addictions' literature is 
listed at the end of this report.<P>
<H6>Etiology</H6>
Scores of theories exist attempting to explain Indigenous substance use patterns. These theories fall into 
four broad categories:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Historical theories claim Indigenous groups were not socially prepared for the potency of alcohol, 
without codes or patterns of moderate consumption and use was modeled primarily upon the aberrant, 
uncontrolled consumption of early frontiersmen.
<LI>Biological/genetic/physiological theories claim Indigenous people are biochemically prone to crave

<LI>Psycho-social/economic theories purport substance abuse is a coping strategy for forced relocation,

<LI>Cultural theories allege transitional or bicultural stress and cultural loss precipitates abuse to the

</OL>
When Indigenous groups are questioned about why they use or abuse various substances, reasons relate to 
social pressure, coping strategy, cultural loss, defiance, boredom and the self-fulfilling prophecy that 
drinking is Indian (16, 17, 18). An interesting hypothesis yet to be tested in the Indigenous community is 
the relationship between machismo and substance abuse. Gender differences in abuse patterns are evident 
in this population.<P>
<H6>Epidemiology</H6>
Indigenous substance use is most commonly inferred from social indicators' analysis: rates of 
incarceration, violent death, alcohol-related diagnoses/discharges, treatment participation and alcohol 
sales. Canadian Indigenous groups make up about 3.7 per cent of the national population yet are 
extremely over represented in treatment centres and penitentiaries (4, 13, 19). In the most recent national 
survey of Indigenous conditions, 17 per cent of all alcohol-related hospitalizations were Indigenous, 
admissions to alcohol and drug treatment centres were 13 times the national rate and 50-60 per cent of all 
illnesses were alcohol-related (4). <P>
Although there are noted differences between the United States and Canada, the similarity of 
circumstance between Indigenous groups makes it worth noting that the Indian Health Service (IHS) 
hospital discharge rate for alcohol-related diagnoses is about three times the U.S. national rate. This level 
increases to four times the U.S. rate for ages 15-44 years. The discharge rate for alcohol psychosis for all 
ages is four times as great (11.8 versus 2.9 per 100,000) as the U.S. discharge rate (20). IHS discharge 
rates for nondependent abuses of alcohol and for alcoholic liver disease are both 3.4 times as great as the 
U.S. national rates (5.8 versus 1.7 per 100,000 and 6.4 versus 1.9 per 100,000 respectively). The alcohol 
dependency syndrome rate is nearly twice the U.S. national rate (35.8 versus 19.7 per 100,000) (20). 
Seventy-five per cent of all American Indian deaths are alcohol-related and extreme variation in alcohol 
and drug use among tribes has been noted. A pattern of binge drinking seems apparent (20, 21, 22).<P>
Still, little clear, direct data exist on the rate of Indigenous Canadian substance use. Many self-report 
surveys have been used but the validity and reliability of their instruments is questionable. Traditional 
formulae that extrapolate alcoholism prevalence from liver cirrhosis rates are not appropriate for the 
Indigenous population because the life span is not long enough. Similarly, the marginalization of 
Indigenous groups has made them difficult to capture in Canadian data bases. The most indicative 
records, because of their equalization value, are statistics on violent deaths that have strong statistical 
correlation with substance abuse (23, 24, 25, 26). Violent death includes suicide, homicide, 
poisoning/overdose, accidents (motor vehicle, air and water transport, firearms) drowning, death due to 
fire, falls, suffocation, overexposure and negligence.<P>
Indigenous adolescent and young adult populations are at greatest risk for violent death. The rate 
increases five fold from approximately 75 per 100,000 between the ages of 5-14 to almost 390 per 100,000 
between the ages of 14-24 (4). Alcohol consumption and suicide rates for the National adolescent are 
concerns (27). For Indigenous adolescents, suicide rates are six times the national adolescent average and 
alcohol consumption is conservatively estimated to be twice that of the national adolescent population (4, 
27). This trend is paralleled by suicide statistics among American Indian young people (10-24) where 
rates were 2-3 times the national average (28).<P>
The most thorough study of violent death that compares Canadian Indigenous mortality rates by gender 
with mainstream populations was prepared by Fiddler for the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations 
(13). Fiddler found that death by violent means accounted for 40 per cent of all deaths in Saskatchewan 
registered "Indians" (those recognized by the Department of Indian Affairs) population (13). This rate 
parallels that found by Jilek in a British Columbia Indigenous population (29). When violent death rates 
were compared to mainstream Saskatchewan populations for 1980, Indigenous people were 3.5 times 
more likely to die violently.<P>
When Fiddler isolated and compared suicidal death rates per 100,000 for mainstream (Canadian and 
Saskatchewan) and Indigenous populations (Saskatchewan only) over the period 1978-1982, the 
Indigenous population was 4.3 times more likely to commit suicide than either mainstream group (12). A 
comparison of suicide rates per 100,000 by age revealed that Indigenous children ages 0-14 were 27.5 
times and 33.6 times more likely to commit suicide than Canadian or Saskatchewan mainstream 
populations respectively. Similarly, in those 15-24 years of age suicide rates were 11.5 and 10.5 times 
higher than Canadian and Saskatchewan young people respectively. "The Canadian male to female 
suicide rate is 3:1 while that of the Saskatchewan non-Indian population is 4:1. The Saskatchewan Indian 
population's male to female suicide ratio is 2:1, indicating that the discrepancy between genders has 
narrowed."(13) When ratios per 100,000 were compared with Saskatchewan mainstream counterparts by 
gender, males are 3.7 times more likely and females 7.3 times more likely to commit suicide. Indigenous 
male suicides peak in the 15-19 age groups and female suicides peak between 20-24. Fiddler found that 
"the overall Saskatchewan Indian female (15-29) suicide rate is 14.5 times higher than the Canadian 
female (15-29) suicide rate per 100,000" (13). Alcohol and drug overdose were the most common form of 
suicide among Indigenous Saskatchewan females whereas firearms were preferred by males. <P>
Fiddler also found that accidental and violent death mortality rates are 3.2 times higher in Indigenous 
than in mainstream populations in Saskatchewan. Indigenous males are twice as likely as their female 
counterparts to die accidentally or violently (13). Cross racially, Saskatchewan Indigenous males are 3.1 
times more likely to die accidentally or violently than their mainstream counterparts; Indigenous females 
are 3.5 times more likely than their mainstream counterparts to die this way. Again, much of this elevated 
risk is accounted for by the 0-14 and 15-24 age groups with rates of accidental and violent deaths actually 
falling below mainstream rates in elderly groups. Comparisons of age-standardized rates were not 
included in Fiddler's report. It also must be pointed out that Fiddler reported extreme variability between 
Indigenous groups in Saskatchewan and figures presented here consider the groups together. Northern 
groups fared far worse than the less isolated southern zones (13).<P>
These trends are parallel to that of Christian and associates who examined alcohol-related mortality in 
Oklahoma Indigenous, black and white populations where the Indigenous male was 3.7 and 3.0 times as 
likely to die of an alcohol-related cause at an earlier age than his white or black counterpart respectively 
(30). Indigenous females, on the other hand, were 5.0 and 3.7 times as likely to die of an alcohol-related 
cause than their white and black counterparts, respectively. Interestingly, not only were Indigenous 
females more likely to die of an alcohol-related cause at an earlier age than their white or black 
counterpart, they were more likely to die younger than their male counterpart as well. In all age 
categories, alcohol-related mortality rates were considerably higher for Indigenous males than females. 
Unfortunately, Christian et al. notes the extreme heterogeneity in alcohol-related mortality among 
Indigenous cultural groups in Oklahoma without addressing the structural differences between these 
groups (30).<P>
Medical Services Branch (MSB) of Health and Welfare Canada (HWC)is responsible for Indian and Inuit 
Health Services in Canada. They reported that the leading causes of death for their service population, in 
hierarchical order, were injury and poisoning (which includes suicides), circulatory system diseases, 
neoplasm and respiratory system disease with the exception of the Atlantic, Québec and Ontario regions 
where death due to circulatory system diseases was more prevalent than death due to injury and poisoning 
(5). Comparatively, age-specific suicide rates are 3.0 to 7.0 times the Canadian rate for the 15 to 34 age 
group; the greatest difference is for those age 15-19, followed closely by the 20-24 group (5). Gender-
specific data indicated males accounted for a greater percentage of total deaths in each category that, they 
theorize, may reflect a slightly greater percentage of men than women. But, because population figures by 
gender were not available for all regions at the time, male/female death rate ratios could not be calculated 
and recent census data indicate females slightly outnumber males. "The largest gap between male and 
female deaths is found in the injury and poisoning category followed by diseases of the circulatory system. 
The smallest gap between the two is in deaths from diseases of the digestive system" (5). Because violent 
death (suicide, injury and poisoning) is the leading cause of adult mortality and has been significantly 
correlated with substance abuse, MSB data suggests an abusing lifestyle is the most significant health 
problem among western Indigenous groups.<P>
When income, employment, household crowding, industrial activity type, isolation, presence of 
Indigenous communities and tourism were included in multiple regression analyses, over 60 per cent of 
the variation in per capita alcohol consumption in the Ontario population over 15 years could be 
accounted for (31). The presence of Indigenous groups alone accounted for 25 per cent of alcohol 
consumption variation. Overall per capita consumption estimates for counties with reserves was 12.06 
litres compared to 9.95 litres for counties without reserves. In the North, the difference between per capita 
litre estimates was 13.42 litres for counties with and 11.11 litres for counties without Indigenous 
communities. In southern Ontario, the estimates were 11.23 litres for counties with and 9.86 litres for 
counties without. Adrian and associates found alcohol consumption was negatively associated with income 
and suggests that improved economic conditions may reduce Indigenous substance abuse (31).<P>
<H6>Indigenous Addictions Organizations</H6>
In 1975, the National Native Alcohol Abuse Program (NNAAP) was established evolving into NNADAP 
in 1982. NNADAP has recently become a subset of a larger initiative entitled Addictions and Community 
Funded Programs (ACFP) whose mandate is to fund programs that combat substance abuse, family 
violence and health programs for status "Indians" living on-reserve. NNADAP is a division of MSB in 
Health and Welfare Canada. Its programs include:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Prevention: Community education, referral, counseling and advocacy programs operated by 
Indigenous community councils or by authorities affiliated with community councils.
<LI>Treatment: Non-medical inpatient residential services, halfway houses and community treatment 
(aftercare in out/day/mobile-patient programs located on or off-reserve).
<LI>Training: Professional and para-professional training in support of prevention and treatment service 
needs.
<LI>Research and development: Pure and applied studies to increase knowledge of substance abuse 
prevention and treatment among Indigenous groups from national and community-specific perspectives.
<LI>Family violence: A new initiative to aid individuals and communities in effectively responding to 
and eliminating family violence, including prevention and promotion.
<LI>Community health representatives: Community members who may be acting as nursing assistants, 
cultural liaisons, environmental health officers and AIDS programmers.
</OL>
Before September, 1989, the National Native Advisory Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NNACADA) 
was NNADAP's governing body. Its annual reports and newsletters place special emphases on suicide, 
urban Indigenous people, Inuit, sexual abuse, unemployment, FAS, the abuse of prescription drugs and 
spousal abuse. In addition, it is worthy to note that several Indigenous-run private and provincial 
educational institutions (e.g., the NECHI Institute on Alcohol and Drug Education in Edmonton, Alberta) 
are developing culturally sensitive substance abuse counsellor training programs. <P>
<H6>Regional Needs Assessments</H6>
In the early 1980s, NNADAP sponsored regional needs assessments to establish problem and program 
profiles upon which to base service development. A review and analysis of these was prepared by 
Whitehead to provide a national profile (32). In his evaluation, Whitehead outlined the specific purpose, 
critically assessed methods used, highlighted important information and proposed recommendations. The 
prevalence and nature of abuse was validly and reliably obtained for the Atlantic, Québec, Saskatchewan 
and NWT regions only (32).<P>
<I>Atlantic:
</I>In New Brunswick, alcohol abusers are over represented in the 25-44 year old age group. About 50 
per cent of the abusing population fall into this age group even though they represent only one-quarter of 
the on-reserve population of New Brunswick. Men were more likely than women to be identified as 
alcohol and/or drug abusers (72 per cent versus 28 per cent). Women were more likely to abuse drugs 
alone (67 per cent vs. 55 per cent) (32). Addiction counsellors in New Brunswick suspected that women 
were abusing prescription mood-altering drugs. And, although only a third of known abusers were 
married, more than half lived with dependent children. In reviewing the off-reserve detoxification and 
rehabilitation facilities in New Brunswick, it became evident that although Indigenous groups account for 
less than one per cent of the total population, they represented over six per cent of those admitted to these 
facilities.<P>
<I>Québec:
</I>Of the 27 communities that participated in the Québec needs assessment, 11 rated the extent of drug 
abuse over 2.5 on a five point scale ranking the seriousness of the problem (low score = abuse by some 
groups, high score = widespread, chronic abuse). Five communities rated the extent of drug abuse over 
3.0. When ranking the seriousness of alcohol abuse on the same five point scale, 20 communities scored 
over 2.5; 16 above 3.0; and three above 4.0, indicating a problem that is immoderate and bordering on 
being out of control. When questioned about which substances caused the most damage among Indigenous 
people of Québec, 19 of 27 communities stated alcoholic beverages, mainly beer and liquor, while seven 
communities reported cannabis as the most damaging substance. Key informants in the Québec 
assessment believed that availability/acceptability, economic conditions and social isolation/cultural 
changes contributed to substance abuse in the Indigenous community.<P>
<I>Saskatchewan: 
</I>In a survey conducted by WMC Research Associates of a Saskatchewan sample, males were more 
likely to consume alcohol (79.8 per cent =F, 87.1 per cent =M) and almost twice as likely to abuse (26.3 
per cent =F, 47.7 per cent =M) (17). Drug use patterns were similar to those for alcohol with 50.3 per cent 
of the females and 61.6 per cent of the males reporting drug use. Among females, 19.7 per cent reported 
frequent drug use while 32.1 per cent of males used drugs regularly. About 38 per cent of the sample 
engaged in abusive patterns of drinking. Alcohol represented a more serious problem than drugs. 
Saskatchewan NNADAP counsellors suggest that lost cultural elements and economic conditions 
precipitated substance abuse problems in their communities. The Saskatchewan Alcoholism Commission 
served 8,000 clients during the fiscal period 1982-1983 of which 7.4 per cent were Treaty Indians. WMC 
Research Associates estimated that 13,300 Treaty Indians require alcohol services; 5,600 needed inpatient 
treatment (17). Base population was not reported.<P>
<I>Northwest Territories:
</I>In the NWT, "Alcohol abuse ranked as the most serious problem facing people of NWT" (32). 
Between 1982 and 1984, 220 Indigenous clients received rehabilitation services at Delta House in the 
Inuvik region; however, it is not reported what proportion of the total treatment population this represents. 
In the Fort Smith region, Northern Addiction Services indicate that 83 per cent of its client caseload is 
Indigenous; however, it is not clear what proportion of the total population was Indigenous. Pauktuutit 
Inuit Women's Association of Canada reveals that substance abuse, inadequate housing and housing 
shortages are viewed as the most serious health problems facing the Inuit community (33).<P>
<H6>Indigenous Treatment Centre Activity</H6>
Indigenous treatment centres are residential facilities with intensive, non-medical, culturally sensitive 
programs that run from four to six weeks. Services are primarily based upon a psychotherapeutic model. 
Detoxification and medical examinations are entrance requirements and, in many cases, court-ordered 
treatment is not accepted. There are 51 NNADAP treatment centres across Canada. The number of beds 
per region is allocated according to status "Indian" population bases.<P>
The Treatment Activity Reporting System (TARS) yields the most recent information on the 
institutionalized chemically dependent Indigenous person. This system records admission and occupancy 
rates, abused substances, cross addiction patterns, recidivism, operational costs and age- and gender-
specific information. In hierarchical order, TARS data reveal that alcohol, narcotics and hallucinogens are 
the most widely abused substances with alcohol being about four times more likely to be the abused 
substance (34). When broken down by region, hallucinogens consistently rank second in the Pacific and, 
at one point in time, in the Atlantic and Québec regions. It is not clear how substances are being classified 
in TARS; however, the publication Straight Facts about Drugs and Drug Abuse has been cited as a 
reference (19). For example, there is some confusion about where cannabis is classified. <P>
The most popular cross addiction patterns were alcohol/narcotics, alcohol/hallucinogens, 
alcohol/prescription drugs and narcotics/hallucinogens. From a review of earlier TARS data, these are 
clearly stable patterns of abuse in the institutionalized Indigenous population (35). Based on the national 
client profile, an average of 1,460 clients received treatment during each quarter, roughly 40 per cent of 
whom were female (34). By age, the average per cent distribution of females and males in treatment is 
depicted in Figure 1.<P>

The bulk of treatment participants is found in the 25-34 age category with men greatly outnumbering 
women. When broken down by region as in Figure 2, it becomes obvious that with a westward movement, 
the discrepancy between the genders in treatment participation narrows.<P>

Across regions it appears that the greatest treatment participation rate is in the 25-34 age group. Alberta 
has the greatest proportion of child participants. Male participation in treatment is consistently greater 
than females for all age categories except children in Ontario (34). These patterns appear to be stable (35). 
This could indicate that there is a greater abuse problem among males or greater barriers (e.g., child care 
and greater stigmatization) to female participation in treatment. TARS does not indicate what prescription 
drugs are abused and by who, or how gender impacted recidivism rates, cross addictions or substances 
abused. And, when looking at nutrition as a factor in alcohol and drug rehabilitation of Canadian 
Indigenous groups, it was found that on intake many clients suffer from poor nutrition. It was also found 
that the nutritional standards of those centres participating in the study could be improved to address this 
problem (36).<P>
Roughly two-thirds of those entering treatment complete the program with little differences between 
regions. The overwhelming majority (68 per cent) of non-completions are the result of client terminations 
and the second leading cause of non-completion are staff terminations (21.5 per cent) (34). To better grasp 
the nature of relapse and improve the quality of treatment, NNADAP sponsored a rigorous follow-up of 
those leaving treatment with the Comprehensive Assessment and Treatment Outcome Research Group. 
Overall, about 36 per cent of the treatment population had been in residential treatment previously. In a 
systematic evaluation of treatment outcome for urban American Indian alcoholics, 47 of 50 interviewed 
after a two-year follow-up reported detoxification relapse (37). In another American study, Flores 
documented the poor alcoholism recovery rates of Indigenous groups and attributes this to the 
incongruence between client and mainstream treatment system values (38).<P>
<H6>Gender Differences</H6>
The NWT Health Promotion Survey provides valuable information on health behaviours of an Indigenous 
sample for comparison with mainstream groups (39). When asked what is the most significant thing you 
should do to improve your health, only Indigenous respondents answered reduce drinking (Indigenous 
Females IF = 1 per cent, Indigenous Males IM = 5 per cent). Almost twice as many Indigenous people 
report currently smoking cigarettes as mainstream Canadian women (IF=72 per cent, IM=71 per cent, 
Canadian Females CF=38 per cent) and are more likely to smoke regularly (IF=57 per cent, IM=59 per 
cent, CF=33 per cent). Indigenous men tend to have the least proscriptive attitudes and to be most 
misinformed about smoking. This pattern is closely followed by Indigenous women and as a very distant 
third, mainstream women. Roughly half of the Indigenous groups indicated that most or all of their 
friends smoke cigarettes versus 16 per cent of mainstream women.<P>
Responses to questions on alcohol consumption revealed that more mainstream women drink alcoholic 
beverages (96 per cent) than either Indigenous men (85 per cent) or women (81 per cent) and more 
consumed alcohol in the past year (CF=90 per cent, IM=70 per cent, IF=62 per cent). This relative 
ranking is consistent in response to questions about the frequency of drinking in the past year and past 
seven days. However, the relative ranking changes when respondents are questioned about heavy 
consumption (four or more/week). Indigenous men outrank Indigenous women who outrank mainstream 
women. These data suggest a greater polarization of drinking patterns in the Indigenous communities, a 
finding that confirms the work of other researchers (18, 31, 40). Indigenous men were most likely to have 
used marijuana/hashish (30 per cent) in the past 12 months with Indigenous women ranking second (16 
per cent) and mainstream women third (10 per cent). However, Indigenous women displayed more 
proscriptive beliefs about marijuana than the other two groups. And, when asked how many of their 
friends drank too much or smoked marijuana, Indigenous men cited more members of their social group 
than Indigenous women followed by mainstream women. Indigenous women have more social 
opportunities for substance use than Euro-Canadian women.<P>
When assessing recovering American Indian alcoholics on drinking-related locus of control (DRIE) as 
well as socio-demographic, familial, cultural, behavioural and treatment-related information, Mariano and 
associates "revealed that higher DRIE scores (more external orientations) were significantly associated 
with less education (r=-.25, p&lt .01) and lower family incomes" (r=-.23, p&lt .01) (pg.334) (41). 
Mariano et al. also discovered men scored significantly higher than women on DRIE indicating their 
belief that they have even less control over their alcohol consumption (41). In addition, the problem 
drinker scored significantly higher on DRIE, than both recovered alcoholics and non-problem drinkers 
regardless of genders. They suggest treatment approaches should focus on enhancing internalized 
drinking-related locus of control and that cognitive-behavioural therapy may be more appropriate for 
minority groups because they are less culturally disruptive. Through their hierarchical analysis of DRIE, 
Mariano and associates found that both gender and drinking status were related to DRIE. They caution 
that without recognition of and control for socio-demographic factors, spurious relationships between 
drinking status and DRIE scores could result (41). In fact, Thurman and associates found variations 
between tribal affiliations and the role that overall locus of control plays in American Indian alcoholics 
(42). When testing Caucasian and Indigenous male and female alcoholics, Hurlburt and Gade found that 
Caucasians were more internal than Indigenous groups and men more internal than females. In a 2x2 
analysis of variance (gender by race) no significant interaction of gender and race was found (45).<P>
Gade and Hurlburt administered the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire to Indigenous female alcoholics 
from Manitoba participating in either inpatient treatment, detoxification or Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) 
(43). Detoxification and treatment groups were above the 90th percentile on the tough-mindedness 
dimension and all groups were at or above the 75th percentile on emotionality. The detox group was 
introverted while the AA group tended toward extroversion. All groups tended to fake looking better when 
compared with normal women. (It is not clear whether normal meant Indigenous, nonalcoholic, 
mainstream or some combination thereof). The women in detox were more tough-minded, emotional and 
introverted than those in AA or inpatient treatment. Gade and Hurlburt pointed out these personality traits 
may explain why traditional treatment approaches do not work well with Indigenous populations. They 
suggest culture specific elements should be incorporated in treatment (43). However, Venn found that 
MMPI scores of male alcoholics of various ethnic backgrounds did not differ significantly when the 
groups were matched on demographic variables (44). In fact, there is confusion in the literature about the 
role of personality in Indigenous addiction.<P>
<H6>Youth</H6>
Experimentation with mind-altering substances or lifetime prevalence (used at least once) has been 
consistently shown to be greater in Indigenous North American youth than in the mainstream (16, 46, 47, 
48, 49). In a Québec survey of 70 Algonquin high school students, it became clear that the reasons for 
alcohol and drug use were related to social pressures, boredom and poor coping strategies. When broken 
down by grade, experience with alcohol and drugs shows an increasing trend throughout high school. 
When broken down by gender, median scores indicate females were more experienced with alcohol and 
drugs. The overwhelming majority of students had at least tried alcohol (90.2 per cent) and tobacco (70.4 
per cent). Among illicit drugs, many (48.6 per cent) students have experimented with cannabis. Other 
illicit drugs of experimentation were, in hierarchical order, solvents, hallucinogens, cocaine, stimulants 
and depressants. The survey revealed a large proportion of the sample are regular users (those who have 
consumed on three or more occasions in the past two months) of alcohol (37.2 per cent), tobacco (32.8 per 
cent) and cannabis (18.6 per cent). Perceived availability of substances and use were highly congruent 
with the summer season provoking greater usage than any other although some reported that licit drug use 
did not change from season to season. Age was positively and significantly correlated with recent (past 
two months) and long-term (past 12 months) use. Both recent and long-term substance use were 
significantly negatively correlated with peer proscriptive norms and frequency of extracurricular physical 
activity (16). Peer influence seems to be the strongest and most consistent correlate of adolescent 
substance use (16, 47, 49). Self-esteem and cultural investment were significantly negatively correlated 
with substance use at pretest only. Rates of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, solvent and cocaine use were 
higher in this sample than in either the mainstream Québec or Ontario comparisons.<P>
When broken down by grade, it is obvious that the higher rates of illicit substance use are attributable to 
users in the higher grade levels. Alcohol use, on the other hand, was higher in the study sample at all 
grade levels. By age 13, over half of an Ontario sample had used alcohol at least once, whereas, 84 per 
cent of 13-year olds in the Québec study sample fell into this category (16). This relative ranking is 
parallel with studies on American Indian adolescents (47). In an American sample, the greatest risk 
period for age of onset for various drugs and alcohol ranged between 10-13 years with males generally 
experimenting earlier than females; however, subjects reported experimenting with marijuana, solvents 
and cocaine as early as age five, six and nine respectively (50). The onset of use at an earlier age has been 
shown in other samples (16, 47).<P>
The use of smokeless tobacco products among Indigenous Canadian adolescents and children is 
substantially higher than among the mainstream. Nearly 30 per cent of 1,170 children (aged 7-21) in a 
Saskatchewan sample claimed to be current users (51, 52). Christensen also noted significant use among 
American preschool groups (53). Pacific northwest young Indigenous Americans report weekly smokeless 
tobacco use by 34 per cent of females and 42.6 per cent of males. Age of onset was before 10 years for 
females and eight years for males (54).<P>
<H6>Solvent Abuse</H6>
Surveys of 2,850 children (ages 4-16) from 25 Manitoba Indigenous communities and 70 Algonquin high 
school students (age 12-18) from Québec were conducted in 1985/86. About 20 per cent of Manitoba 
children and 15 per cent of Québec youth had at least tried solvent sniffing. Six and nine per cent of 
Manitoba and Québec Indigenous youth respectively reported continuous use beyond experimentation; 3 
per cent of Manitoba children and 2 per cent of Québec adolescents reported daily, weekly or monthly use 
of solvents (55). Median age of onset for solvent sniffing in the Québec group was 12 years for females 
and 13 years for males. In Manitoba, the median age of solvent users was 12 years old; however, some 
children between 4-8 years old also reported sniffing (55). Males accounted for a greater proportion of 
sniffers in a study of Canadian Indigenous communities (56). Wingert and Fifield found that young 
Indigenous American repeat solvent inhalers possessed less desirable physical and psychological assets 
according to the Revised Social Assets Scale than do the non-user comparison (57). The groups differed 
significantly in school grades and were more positive in their ideal self-appraisal if they were non users 
(57). It has also been noted that commercial products containing denatured alcohol, most commonly hair 
spray and spray disinfectants, are being ingested (9, 58). Lifetime prevalence of solvent use increased in 
American male and female Indian youth from 1975-1983. Younger students were apparently at greater 
risk of abuse (49).<P>
<H6>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome</H6>
In their fetal alcohol syndrome education package, McTimoney and associates noted FAS incidence rates 
are higher than average among Indigenous Canadians (59). Conservative estimates of the incidence of 
FAS/FAE in general Canadian samples yield 1-3 live births per 1,000 (60). McTimoney and associates 
cited American studies that show an Indian FAS incidence ranging from 1.4 to 9.8/1,000 (59). Asante and 
Nelms-Matzke discovered an FAS/FAE rate of 25 per 1,000 children (0-16 years) among Indigenous 
northwestern BC populations (Métis and Indian) and 46/1,000 among Yukon Indigenous groups as 
compared to 0.4/1,000 for mainstream groups in both regions (61). Asante speculates that these 
differences may be due to alcohol abuse in women of child-bearing years, and differences in alcohol 
metabolism and consumption patterns as well as dietary deficiencies (62). Bray and Anderson criticized 
Asante's findings for failing to control for confounding variables (e.g., greater fertility rates and span of 
child-bearing years) (63). They also indicate that a logical first step would be to examine alcohol 
consumption patterns but, to date, "there are no objective data regarding typical and excessive alcohol 
consumption patterns and drinking styles of Canadian Indigenous women of childbearing age" (6). 
Similarly, FAS rates have been reported to be relatively high (5.1/1,000) in Alaska Native populations 
although it is not clear if the denominator is live births or child populations (53). In other American 
samples, Malin et al. discovered a higher prevalence of FAS/FAE for Indigenous infants when compared 
with mainstream groups (64). Women account for almost half of all Indigenous liver cirrhosis mortality, 
4.4 times the U.S. rate, and overall mortality rates for Indigenous women age 15-34 was 37 times the rate 
for mainstream women (20, 64). It is also clear that beyond this abuse of the fetus, addiction plays a 
significant role in child abuse and neglect cases (65).<P>
<H6>Community-Based Programs</H6>
The community is the heart of substance abuse prevention and treatment programming. Most community-
based addiction programming is funded by NNADAP which strongly encourages preventive strategies and 
will soon be publishing a community focused prevention framework. Community-based NNADAP 
counsellors make referrals to treatment centres and, in most cases, provide a wide range of other social 
services. Many program staff receive basic alcohol and drug abuse training from counsellors funded by 
MSB. Although highly variable in content and scope, the core components of most training packages 
prepare staff to develop public education campaigns, provide remedial counseling and participate in crisis 
intervention. Diverse activities are undertaken by communities to combat the problem, including 
legislated abstinence, recreational, promotional, educational activities as well as participation in National 
Addictions Awareness Week.<P>
In most communities, the alcohol and drug counsellor works in an interdisciplinary health team consisting 
of a public health nurse and a community health representative. Community-based outreach programs face 
tremendous challenges because the counsellor is usually known or related to the client and anonymity is 
difficult to secure. In addition, if counsellors are not recovered addicts, they face sharp resistance from 
those suffering addictions.<P>
No discussion of community-based programming would be complete without highlighting Alkali Lake, 
British Columbia, where almost 100 per cent alcoholism was turned around to 95 per cent sobriety. With 
bootlegging eliminated, a voucher system for social aid benefits and a job reward for alcoholism treatment 
completion, the efforts of a determined chief and council transformed a despairing situation to one of 
industry and hope. In Ontario, isolated communities have shown short-term benefits from prohibition 
(56). Although it is not known how many communities in Canada maintain prohibitive alcohol bylaws, 
roughly 70 per cent of U.S. communities impose prohibition (20). May and Smith discovered that a 
majority (81 per cent) of Navajo groups supports prohibition, with older groups having a slightly greater 
tendency to do so (66). May reported that legalization has positive long-term effects on U.S. Indigenous 
consumption patterns; however, short-term (3-5 years) effects were disastrous in one community (21).<P>
<H6>Urban Populations</H6>
The National Association of Friendship Centres' (NAFC) Urban Research Project: Alcohol Drug &amp  
Solvent Abuse (Phase I and II) profiles the existing Friendship Centre substance abuse services and 
portrays the types and levels of abuse in specific target groups (9). Information was collected from 84 of 
95 Friendship Centres in Canada and associate groups. Classifications of use were adapted from 
NNADAP and included light, occasional, chronic, severe, out of control and life threatening. Light use 
reflected use without problem; the occasional user would include the binge drinker without serious 
problems; chronic use meant causing serious problems; severe use reflected lost ability to deal with 
activities of daily living; and out of control signified that the mind altering substance was the single most 
important thing in their lives; life-threatening is self-explanatory.<P>
Alcohol seemed to be the drug of preference among urban populations where severe levels of abuse among 
all age and target groups existed (9). Most Friendship Centres did not have resources for substance abuse 
programming and felt that mainstream services are inadequate for cultural reasons. Services currently 
being offered in the NAFC network are only indirectly related to the addictions. "Statistical information 
concerning actual or estimated numbers of urban native people with substance abuse problems is virtually 
non-existent within Friendship Centres" (9). Urban populations face relatively similar problems to their 
rural counterparts in that unemployment, poor housing, increased risk of alcohol-related incarceration and 
poor education were cited as the common dilemmas (9).<P>
NAFC developed profiles of the abuse patterns of single and pregnant women as well as unemployed men. 
They found that "43 out of 56 responding Friendship Centres reported substance abuse among single 
women in their communities" (9). Substances most commonly abused by single women include alcohol, 
illicit drugs, prescription drugs, non prescription drugs (not defined), solvents and cocaine. Single women 
abuse for social and stress-related reasons and the centres reported individuals who drink at each of the 
aforementioned levels of abuse. The negative effects of their abuse were perceived to be poor reputation, 
child care and nutrition, suicide, sexually transmitted disease, accidents, death, unwanted pregnancy as 
well as employment/studies-related problems.<P>
For pregnant women, 41 out of 54 responding Friendship Centres reported abuse problems for every 
classification of use. Substances abused include alcohol, cannabis, prescription drugs, solvents, LSD, 
cocaine and heroine (listed in a hierarchical fashion). Alcohol is identified as the primary substance 
abused for all Indigenous groups (32, 34, 35). Reasons for abuse were either socially motivated or related 
to coping; consequences include marriage break up, depression, FAS, child apprehension at birth, death, 
drug withdrawal, disease, accidents and criminal behaviour.<P>
In the unemployed male category, 43 of 56 centres reported abuse at all levels of use with preferred 
substances being alcohol, prescription drugs, non-prescription drugs, illegal street drugs and solvents. 
Consequences for unemployed men were suicides, homicides, accidental death as well as physical and 
sexual problems.<P>
To date, few provincial systems have Indigenous specific substance abuse treatment or prevention 
programs. In some instances, however, beneficiaries may be lucky enough to encounter health 
professionals who have had cross-cultural training or are cultural insiders. The Friendship Centre network 
is the only culturally hospitable environment in the urban centre and few are equipped to deal with 
substance abuse prevention or treatment programs. <P>
<H6>Research Limitations</H6>
This report was heavily reliant upon the written word and there is much work going on in the 
communities that is largely undocumented. Community-based health data are collected primarily by the 
federal government (e.g., MSB, HWC) whose collection methods and research priorities vary considerably 
across regions and differ from provincial systems. This circumstance makes normative data about the use 
and abuse of alcohol by Indigenous people unavailable on a national basis. There are also many 
methodological weaknesses in current efforts. For example, where survey research is available, few studies 
discuss the construct validity and reliability of their instruments. In addition, because some communities 
have been grossly over-studied, data collection is tainted with apathy or majority non-participation. 
Holistic versus reductionistic principles and the inconsequence of numbers and written words makes 
western scientific methods uncomfortably foreign in Indigenous communities. Significantly greater value 
is placed on the subjective in Indigenous science and other cultural barriers complicate communications, 
data collection and interpretation. The more narrowly defined research population of Indigenous people 
lacks a satisfactory addictions database with which to assess the representativeness of a sample; as a 
result, mainstream Canadian groups often serve as a comparison group despite non-comparability on 
several demographic variables. Convenient samples of on-reserve populations are not generalizable to 
urban, Métis or Inuit community contexts. Scattered groups may be too heterogeneous in community 
structure. Even within communities, many people recognized by the federal government as "Indian" are of 
various racial and ethnic origins. In addition, urban Indigenous populations are either not identified or do 
not participate in mainstream polls such as the recent National Alcohol and Other Drugs Survey. On a 
more promising note, TARS is relatively comparable across regions and is the best, most systematic 
collection of data on the institutionalized Indigenous population. <P>
<H6>Recommendations for Future Research </H6>
Many communities suffer a socially devastating rate of addictions. Further study of the problem, in 
comparative terms or otherwise, has the limited value of using resources that might be applied to the 
formulation of solutions. In some cases, where problem identification can truly empower the addicted, the 
following recommendations would apply.<P>
<OL>
<LI>Where further problem identification is required, direct, quantitative assessments of consumption 
patterns should be used for the most commonly used substances (i.e., alcohol, tobacco, cannabis).
<LI>Measures should include age, gender, tribal affiliation, geographic location and socioeconomic status 
with standardized valid and reliable instruments.
<LI>Substance abuse related diagnoses and hospital discharge statistics should be collected. 
<LI>At the community level, creative action must be initiated to arrest the problem.
<LI>Rigorous evaluation must be a part of programs
<LI>Action should be documented and then generalized so it can be adapted to other sites.
</OL>
In order of priority, it would be useful to know:<P>
<OL>
<LI>What programs or models seem most successful for Indigenous Canadians?
<LI>What is structurally or politically different about those communities practising prohibition or have a 
high level of sobriety? What are the prevailing attitudes toward and impacts of prohibition?
<LI>What role do culture, economics, personality traits, locus of control, community characteristics and 
self-image play in the addictive behaviours of Indigenous Canadians?
<LI>What are the programmatic needs and preferences of addicted Indigenous people by age, gender, 
residence and socioeconomic status?
<LI>What kinds of outreach/follow-up/aftercare programs are being used in the community? What seems 
most successful? 
<LI>What are the attitudinal and institutional barriers to rehabilitation?
<LI>What is the age of first use for each drug?
<LI>What are the cross-addiction patterns, consequences of abuse, and nature of abuse for addicted 
Indigenous subgroups (i.e.., youth, elderly, women, urban, rural, socioeconomic status)?
</OL>
The research must bear maximum relevance to the community and familial situation. This can only be 
achieved in partnership with Indigenous groups. Before embarking upon community-based research, it 
would be useful to understand the principle and value of noninterference best illustrated in Brant's work 
(67). Valid, uniformly and reliably collected data is of paramount importance for regional comparisons 
and, for an already over-studied group with its own science, this will be a formidable task. Much work 
still needs to be done to develop and fine tune culturally and linguistically appropriate treatment and 
prevention programs and to isolate possible etiology. An important database, the Post-Censal Aboriginal 
Peoples Survey (Statistics Canada), may provide valuable information on language, health, social issues, 
disability, mobility, education, employment, income and housing. The adult survey (15 years and over) 
only contains questions on cigarette smoking and frequency of drinking occasions. Illicit and prescription 
drug use are omitted but are strongly recommended for future endeavours.<P>
<H4>Conclusions </H4>
The purpose of this background document was to isolate what is known about addictions among 
Indigenous Canadians for an academic audience. The major sources of information included reports 
prepared or statistics kept by consulting firms, Indigenous organizations/treatment centres and NNADAP 
with some supplementary information from the scientific community. Very little information available is 
published or rigorously scientific. Most reports were heavily reliant upon social indicators analysis with 
all of its concomitant complications. Still, by all methods, in all regions, the data suggest that alcohol is 
the abused substance of choice, that men are more likely to abuse than women and that, comparatively, the 
negative consequences of addiction are more severe in Indigenous groups. Although it is uncertain why 
males succumb more often to abusing patterns, it is hypothesized in the Indigenous community that their 
loss in society has been the greatest. Women may still carry on their traditional role as first educators and 
life carriers; however, a large proportion of men do not participate in traditional or modern industry and 
economy.<P>
Being single, unemployed and poorly educated are demographic factors associated with higher rates of 
abuse. Indigenous children (under 15) have entered alcohol and drug treatment centres. They are dying 
violently at disquieting rates as a result of their own addictions. Indigenous children are subjected to gross 
abuse and neglect as a result of their parents' addiction. Age at onset is slightly younger than mainstream 
populations. Social support or peer proscriptive norms seem consistently related to use across gender and 
age groups. Adolescence and young adulthood is the most devastating period in terms of personal abuse 
consequences; peak treatment participation occurs in the 25-34 age group. There is no agreement, 
however, about age and peak prevalence of an abusing lifestyle.<P>
It appears that groups residing in the eastern regions of Canada may not experience the same severity of 
substance abuse problems as other regions. This circumstance is evident in mortality and treatment 
participation patterns. Lower levels of treatment participation in these regions may reflect either less 
availability of treatment services or that the artifacts of acculturation in eastern groups have not been 
controlled. Locus of control of Indigenous alcoholics may be more external than nonalcoholics and 
mainstream groups. A pattern of binge drinking has been noted. There may also be a greater polarization 
in alcohol consumption patterns. In other words, there are more abstainers and more heavy 
consumers.<P>
In terms of the etiological theories, only two broad categories offer promise of change: socioeconomic and 
cultural theories. But, even the broad explanations offered by these theories cannot account for great 
differences in substance use among the Indigenous community whose members have identical 
socioeconomic and cultural environments. Human addiction is an extremely complicated construct, a 
result of the interplay of many internal and external variables. Both the rate and consequence of addiction, 
however, is significantly elevated in the Indigenous community. And, by all subjective and objective 
estimates, the real differences between mainstream and Indigenous communities are primarily 
structural.<P>

Substance Use</H3>
<H4>Diane McKenzie, Senior Analyst<BR>
Policy and Research Unit, Canadian Centre on Substance 
Abuse</H4>
<H5>Background</H5>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA) was established by an Act of Parliament in 1988 to 
bring cohesiveness to Canada's efforts to reduce the harms associated with alcohol and other drug abuse. 
In its coordinating/facilitation role, CCSA is committed to listening, learning and doing whatever is 
necessary to empower Canada's Aboriginal people to improve conditions created by substance abuse. <P>
It was within this learning context that CCSA sponsored a joint Research Advisory Meeting with the 
National Native Alcohol and Drug Addiction Program (NNADAP) in February 1992. Aboriginal and non 
Aboriginal addiction specialists met to discuss some hard issues of substance abuse in First Nations 
communities. The meeting was based on a report prepared by Kim Scott, an Aboriginal researcher (this 
volume). This paper summarizes the dialogue that emerged from this historic meeting. Overall, the group 
concluded that although the problems of substance abuse have been widely studied in Aboriginal 
communities, we are some distance from getting at the root causes of the problem with programming and 
research. In recognition of these circumstances, the group called for better information about Aboriginal 
substance abuse and a solution-oriented approach to help improve community responses to the conditions 
created by these problems.<P>
The objective of the meeting was not only to learn more about Aboriginal substance abuse, but to stimulate 
new research directions and to identify new ways to assess community interventions. Another important 
objective was to build bridges between addictions and First Nations communities. Among the topics 
discussed were: epidemiology, treatment systems and issues, prevention, research needs and gaps, and 
actions that can be taken  to improve conditions that lead to substance abuse.<P>
To capture the rich, exploratory quality of the CCSA/NNADAP discussions, this report adopts a question 
and answer format, focusing on the issues, not the speaker. As befitting a true learning situation, most 
questions were asked by CCSA representatives and answers were given by NNADAP members.<P>
<H5>Epidemiology of Aboriginal Substance Abuse</H5>
<H6>Opening Remarks</H6>
The recent history of Aboriginal people in Canada is dominated by health problems, captivity and 
dysfunction, all of which are characterized within the Indian Act. Aboriginal populations are younger and 
have substantially higher levels of mortality and morbidity than their counterparts in the general 
population. Except for cancers, Aboriginal youths are at 2-6 times greater risk for every social problem 
experienced by other Canadian youth. They are 3-4 times more likely to die from accidental death than 
other Canadian youth. They are 3-4 times more likely to die from accidental death than other Canadians; 
suicide rates for Aboriginal adolescents are six times the national adolescent average (Scott, 1994). Poor 
economic conditions, education levels and social pressure appear to be associated with these problems. 
Children are severely affected by these conditions, a situation most evident in their high rate of suicide 
and use of solvents, alcohol and drugs at an early age. Aboriginal children under the age of 14 are 27.5 
times more likely to commit suicide than those in the general population (Scott, 1994). In some 
communities, they begin to use solvents as early as five and eight years old (Layne, 1987).<P>
There appears to be a geographic pattern regarding accidental and violent death among Aboriginal 
communities: western Aboriginal people are three to four times more likely to die from accidental and 
violent death than their eastern counterparts, and those who live in isolated northern locations appear to 
be at greater risk than those who live in the south (Scott, 1994). Men are more likely to abuse alcohol than 
women, while women tend to use more prescription drugs than men. Men between the ages of 25 and 44 
are the main abusers of alcohol and drugs in the Aboriginal population (Scott, 1994).<P>
There are about 1,500,000 Aboriginals in Canada including people of mixed origin. The many different 
categories of Aboriginal people, based on tribal affiliation, regional distribution, European contact and 
community structure, complicate methods for assessing the epidemiology of substance abuse in their 
communities. These factors detrimentally affect the ability to examine substance abuse experiences 
rigorously. <P>
Several different reasons and theories underlying Aboriginal problems are used to examine the 
epidemiology of Aboriginal substance abuse. Some think the explanation lies in the areas of coping 
strategies and the idea of the self-fulfilling prophecy (Scott, 1994). <P>
Traditional approaches to measuring the prevalence of substance abuse in the general population, such as 
the Jellinek Formula (based on the number of deaths due to liver cirrhosis), may not be relevant to 
Aboriginal populations because of their diversity and isolation. For example, Aboriginal people do not live 
long enough to die from liver cirrhosis. According to the research literature, Fiddler's method using 
violent death as the primary indicator of substance abuse may be most appropriate to consider for 
Aboriginal populations. <P>
<H6>Discussion</H6>
<I>1.  Why do some people fall into problematic lifestyles when others do 
not?
</I>One main reason is peer pressure. Many individuals resist those excessive lifestyles despite the 
poverty, cultural transition and other factors. Social pressure and social expectations bring to mind the 
sociological theory of the "Crab in the Barrel." The minute one person tries to get out of a difficult 
situation (such as having a successful business) he or she gets ostracized by the community. The economic 
situation of the entire community must remain the same to retain membership in that community. Peer 
pressure is certainly a factor in pressure to drink, and pressure to sober up as well.<P>
When we talk about issues such as peer pressure, we must also keep in mind the experiences and 
behaviours of children who are eight years old. Self efficacy and social pressure don't have time to enter 
the picture; we have to think of a whole different set of realities when we talk about children. 
Unfortunately there is no research on these issues in Aboriginal communities. It might be interesting to 
apply the theories of social interaction developed by Skog or Wellman to examine how peer pressure 
might work in Aboriginal communities.<P>
<I>2.  Are there ways to identify people who are at greater risk for substance 
abuse problems in the community?
</I>There may be ways to identify those who are at risk of substance abuse and the related problems in 
communities, but we need research to find how to make those judgments directly. Certain problems such 
as suicide, fetal alcohol syndrome and solvent abuse are especially difficult to identify. The usual methods 
(e.g., survey research) used to address these problems in the community are not reliable and valid for the 
Aboriginal population at this time. Indirect evidence, however, is very telling; we know accidental 
violence is related to inebriation. Violence, however, is not just related to drunkenness, but more so with 
very high levels of inebriation. Violence almost always involves people who tend to be violent anyway and 
who get extremely drunk. Unfortunately, indirect measures (e.g., violent death) are not enough. Direct 
measures of these extreme behaviours must be examined as well especially for those who are at greater 
risk of substance abuse, especially for patterns of drinking and violent behaviour.<P>
<I>3.  While recognizing the diversity of Aboriginal communities, to what 
extent are alcohol and drug use on the agenda of local communities?
</I>About 70 per cent of Aboriginal communities see alcohol and drug problems as a priority and ranks 
them in the top three issues. This information comes from the pre-transfer (health) needs assessments for 
NNADAP. About 10 per cent of all Aboriginal communities (n=60) participated in the pre-transfer needs 
assessment. <P>
Aboriginal substance abuse problems are already on the national agenda. NNADAP put it on the regional 
health priorities list for the 1990s, and women and children are also on the secondary priorities list. We 
should think about the role that epidemiology can have in putting alcohol and drug use among Aboriginal 
people on the national and community agendas for the general population.<P>
<I>4.  Do we know much about the use of illicit drugs (e.g., cannabis, 
cocaine and heroin) and the extent of problems in the communities? Are alcohol 
and solvents the real problem?
</I>There isn't very much information available about the use of illicit drugs. The Quebec study provides 
some information and ranks use problems 1) alcohol, 2) tobacco and 3) cannabis. Unfortunately, the 
Treatment Activity Reporting System (TARS) doesn't differentiate the incidence of alcohol or drug use. 
The system can tell what substances people are abusing generally, but this information may not reflect 
what is happening in the community.<P>
<I>5.  Given the high variability of use and problems across the country, has 
anyone looked at that variability in a systematic fashion to identify what 
characteristics are associated with heavy alcohol use?
</I>No studies look at variability in a systematic, rigorous, scientifically valid manner. The TARS data 
collected by the NNADAP Medical Services Department is available, but the nursing stations collect the 
information in different ways. Variability can be examined only when the data are better and reporting 
procedures are more consistent across the country.<P>
<I>6.  What about the use of survey research methods?
</I>Aboriginal communities are surveyed for everything but substance abuse. Some people have made the 
decision not to participate in surveys. As a result, most surveys of Aboriginal communities are based on 
problematic samples and responses. Despite these problems, we should not throw the technique away as a 
data collection method. It remains the best way to collect data for answering certain kinds of questions; 
but it shouldn't be the first approach to take in Aboriginal communities. <P>
First Nations communities should survey themselves. Surveys taken by others sit on the shelf and are 
meaningless when the information from them should be used by Aboriginal society to improve conditions. 
Surveys should be negotiated with the community and used by the community.<P>
<I>7.  Before we can talk about the etiology of substance abuse problems, it 
is important to look at the historical factors that affect how they are perceived. 
What historical factors contribute to the definition of substance abuse problems 
in Aboriginal groups in Canada?
</I>Although each one of us in this room can offer a different historical interpretation of the Aboriginal 
experience and how it relates to substance abuse, let me offer one view. Aboriginal peoples retreated for 
self-preservation of culture and government acquired masses of land from many different groups of 
Aboriginal peoples. By retreating for self-preservation, the activities of the dominant society became 
dramatically different from Aboriginal society. <P>
Within this context, it's only been since about World War II that young people have left the reserves. Only 
about two generations of Aboriginal Canadians have made contact with the mainstream population. To 
some extent, their integration with the population has met with great frustrations because Aboriginal 
Canadians need to acquire certain skills to adapt to the patterns of the larger society. This situation placed 
certain stressors on Aboriginal communities. <P>
Another point is that this historical situation may place limitations on what is known about certain 
problems in the Aboriginal population. For example, when we look at changes in disease (e.g., diabetes), 
there may not actually be an increased incidence in the disease, but rather, we are only now recognizing 
and identifying problems that occur naturally in the population as a result of extended contact. Diagnostic 
practices are also better than they were in the past; these practices are also becoming available to 
Aboriginal groups.<P>
Aboriginal peoples are frustrated because they lack so many skills; these patterns of frustration take over 
and become the model for the next generation. This lack of skills has left them with the impression that 
they do not deserve a piece of the pie, leaving a feeling of demoralization.<P>
Take communications, for example. Northern areas have TV now and Aboriginals can see what's 
happening in other parts of the world. Their standard of living is much lower than other parts of Canada; 
this knowledge adds to their frustration. About 60 per cent of Aboriginal people are constantly trying to 
integrate with the general population _ with varying success. The point is that when we define problems 
that are related to substance abuse, the terms we use to describe them are selective and may not really get 
to the crux of the problem. These comments suggest that many Aboriginal problems may be a function of 
normal stratification. <P>
<I>8.  Are problems similar for non-Aboriginal people? Are the apparent 
differences due to being rich or poor?
</I>We don't know if non-Aboriginal populations and poor people show the same level of problems as 
Aboriginal populations.<P>
<I>9.  Are certain communities at greater risk for certain kinds of problems? 
If so, perhaps early identification systems could be set up, especially to help 
women and children.
</I>There appear to be common features among the communities that are at risk for substance abuse 
problems. For example, all of these communities have multiple behaviour problems and have certain 
problems. Perhaps we could identify these problems early and adapt the social systems that are in place to 
handle them. The earlier we identify problems, the easier it is to treat them. For example, Aboriginal 
communities have education systems and health nursing stations that try to identify problems early. 
Perhaps these systems could be adapted to identify and protect children who are at risk. Women and 
children are certainly at greater risk during drinking situations. <P>
<I>10.  What issues should be addressed in the future? 
</I>There are several issues that should be addressed. For example, it would be useful to find the most 
cost-effective way to improve things in Aboriginal communities. Ideological issues about the underlying 
reasons for substance abuse are important but difficult to agree on. It may be some time before we can 
adequately address it. Another point is that methods used to understand alcohol problems in western 
society (such as liver cirrhosis mortality or alcohol sales) cannot be applied to Aboriginal populations in 
any useful way; new approaches and special studies are needed. Studies such as surveys, mortality studies, 
ethnographic studies of communities at risk and those involving treatment populations would also be 
informative. Aboriginal community leaders should determine what kinds of studies are wanted, what 
kinds of questions should be asked and what purposes the information should serve. Information should be 
collected in the least intrusive way possible. Finally, the information that is collected should be used to 
improve local conditions.<P>
<H5>Treatment Systems and Issues</H5>
<H6>Opening Remarks</H6>
Aboriginal people are over represented in treatment services for alcohol and drug abuse. Almost one in 
five admissions for alcohol-related problems in Canada is Aboriginal; over 1,500 Aboriginal Canadians 
receive treatment annually (Scott, 1994). Alcohol is four times more likely to be the presenting problem 
than other substances. For example, hospital discharge rates for Aboriginal Canadians for substance-
related diagnoses are three times the national rate. Alcoholic psychosis is four times the national rate, 
alcoholic liver disease is 3.5 and alcohol dependency is 2.5 times the national rate. The majority of 
Aboriginal people in treatment are receiving it for 1) alcohol 2) narcotics and 3) hallucinogens (in 
hierarchical order) (Scott, 1994). The most common cross addiction patterns are 1) alcohol and narcotics, 
2) alcohol and hallucinogens, 3) alcohol and prescription drugs; and 4) narcotics and hallucinogens (in 
hierarchical order). About 40 per cent of those in treatment are women and the bulk of treatment 
participation is in the 25 to 34 age category. The extent to which these patterns represent the rest of the 
Aboriginal community is not clear. Binge drinking appears to be the predominant pattern among 
individuals who enter the treatment system.<P>
Gender differences in treatment participation are narrowing in most places across the country, except 
Quebec, where the treatment centres are newer and women are still reluctant to attend. The greatest 
barrier to getting women into treatment is that there are no child care facilities in the centres. Women end 
up paying for child care, a circumstance that is virtually impossible for these people. Women are seen as 
selfish for looking after their treatment needs when they set aside their role as nurturer.<P>
NNADAP rehabilitation centres are non-medical facilities that are residential and culturally sensitive. 
Treatment programs are primarily based on a psychotherapeutic model and based on four to six week 
programs. Court-mandated treatment cases are not accepted. Treatment outcomes are encouraging, with 
over two-thirds of those who enter treatment completing their programs; more than one-third of those who 
complete treatment return at a later date. Of those who don't complete, about 70 per cent terminate 
themselves.<P>
The role of personality traits in Aboriginal substance abuse has been examined; people are defined as 
having internal or external locus of control. Aboriginal men are less internal in their drinking than 
Aboriginal women. Cross-racially, non-Aboriginals are more internal than Aboriginals and men are more 
internal than women.<P>
<H6>Discussion</H6>
<I>1.  What are the major substance abuse problems that show up in the 
treatment system?
</I>The NNADAP treatment information indicates that alcohol abuse almost never occurs alone in 
Aboriginal communities with over 80 per cent abusing other substances. Even solvents are used in 
combination with alcohol. Prescription drug use ranks about fifth in the treatment system. This pattern 
may be a gender issue. This could be explored through the TARS information system. If people get into 
treatment early, 95 per cent of them will use alcohol alone and the level of severity of their problems will 
be much lower. <P>
Some kinds of substance abuse seem to be related to self-abuse, particularly for children. Children from 
problem families use solvents very early _ sometimes before the age of eight or 10; there is little control 
over these kids. They are over-running the community, being tremendously destructive. They will do 
anything to get the solvents _ even if it's locked away. You have to ask what drives these children to such 
self-destructive behaviours at such an early age. Until you understand these behaviours, nothing can be 
done to stop it or change it. These problems, in turn, may aggravate the addiction problems with their 
parents. <P>
<I>2.  How important is cultural sensitivity for addressing Aboriginal 
substance abuse in treatment?
</I>Treatment programs that are designed for the general population are often institutionalized and 
culturally disruptive to many Aboriginal people because the values are so different. Ceremonial practices 
have been introduced in treatment centres to address this problem. Besides, there are so many different 
approaches available and used in programs for the general population.<P>
<I>3.  Is there a "best" approach to treatment for Aboriginal people? 
</I>No model is most effective. There are many models available, each attempting to reach appropriate 
individuals. For example, in Psychiatry, the model says, don't expect individual problems to change just 
because environment changes (even if it is desirable). It says that a person is in a predicament and that he 
or she must come out of it. We have to take care of ourselves because we are individuals _ we can't let 
circumstances sink us. Another important model that is used widely is AA. AA implies a lack of control 
and the control goes to the group _ and serves as a support system for those in trouble. According to AA 
principles, the solution to alcohol problems should come as a result of being part of the group.<P>
Many First Nations community experiences are not documented and it is difficult to say if there is a "best" 
approach available. Most of the successful community efforts put emphasis on self-help, whether it is 
based on AA or Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACOA). Self-help is really useful because it is simple and 
helps people maintain sobriety after treatment. The benefit is that there is no money attached to it. <P>
The concepts that are learned in treatment are also really important for Aboriginals to bring back to their 
communities for maintaining sobriety. Programs like AA help get people over the difficult situations that 
occur during the week. AA's notion that you can't tackle the problem alone and that you must maintain 
kinship with others is important. Culture-specific programs are especially important.<P>
Another side of this programming issue is the role of violence in treatment. Many people enter treatment 
because a situation at home ends up in violence; other people end up in treatment because they have a 
chronic ailment due to substance abuse. Treatment should address the issue that some people have no 
established pattern of dependent behaviour. These issues affect how we classify certain patterns of abuse 
for Aboriginal people.<P>
<I>4.  Is mental illness addressed in the substance abuse treatment system?
</I>Along with substance abuse, there is also an increased risk of suicide in Aboriginal populations. 
Suicide is not just an indicator of mental illness, but also an indicator of psychiatric disorder. Today's 
treatment models have been developed only with a partial understanding of the problems in Aboriginal 
communities. It ignores any and all psychiatric input. The rebirth of the notion of comorbidity makes it 
more risky for you to present with a substance abuse problem. Psychiatric disorder and mental illness 
should be considered within the substance abuse treatment system. <P>
<I>5.  Is there a place for court-mandated cases in the treatment system?
</I>NNADAP treatment programs will not take court-mandated treatment cases. It is an exclusion 
criterion. Court cases go to the provincial treatment systems, or jail. These clients are not taken because 
they are manipulative and tend to gang up on other clients. Some programs agree to take one or two of 
these cases, but rarely more than that per cycle.<P>
<I>6.  What is the goal of treatment? Is the goal always abstinence? What 
about responsible drinking?
</I>Almost all Aboriginal treatment programs go for abstinence. If there was a way to talk about social 
drinking in Aboriginal communities, we could offer it. Our statistics say that Aboriginal people who are 
recovering cannot just go out and socialize, they must fully abstain. It seems that people who enter 
treatment are so far into the stages of alcoholism that abstinence is the only way. This isn't to say that it 
won't be possible a few years down the road if we manage to control the problems a little better.<P>
If you want to start talking about social drinking as a viable treatment option, you must begin with 
primary prevention and encourage responsible behaviour and early intervention. Research shows that 
controlled drinking is a reasonable goal for someone who is a first-time patient, but not appropriate for the 
revolving-door patient. There seems to be a continuum of problem drinking. If that person is heavily 
dependent on alcohol, you don't touch controlled drinking. But if you get them early enough, you might be 
able to. You must learn how to dissect the nature of the problem better.<P>
<I>7.  How would non-problematic drinking patterns be described for 
Aboriginals?
</I>It's hard to say. Many drinkers drink heavily right from the beginning _ sometimes from the time they 
are 11 years old. Self-report information taken from treatment services such as the Addiction Research 
Foundation indicates that first contact with Aboriginal drinkers is at about four drinks per day. In fact, 
there is not enough information to say what is and what isn't problematic. There just isn't enough 
documentation of the full scope of consequences experienced by Aboriginal problem drinkers. Surveys 
would help document these findings. For example, in the general population about 20 per cent don't drink 
and 60 per cent drink without consequences. It would be useful to have comparable information for 
Aboriginal groups. There are indicators associated with very heavy, single-occasion drinking, not just 
biological mechanisms at work in defining the consequences.<P>
If a survey is used to collect this information, however, one has to consider what the information is for, 
who is going to use it, why it is motivated. The Aboriginal respondent is going to say to you, why do you 
come to my house and ask if I drink? The survey will have a story of its own that should be shared; it 
should also have cultural definitions. Nations (e.g., the Iroquois) have different cultural definitions of 
drinking that reflect how they drink and the problems they experience.<P>
<H5>Prevention Programs </H5>
<H6>Opening Remarks</H6>
One of the most common approaches to prevention among U.S. Aboriginal communities is self-imposed 
prohibition, with almost 70 per cent of American Aboriginal communities being dry. Prohibition isn't a 
complete solution, however, because of bootlegger activity. Other approaches include public education, 
such as "keep the circle strong," a view started by Maggie Hodgson of NECHI that says that we have to 
keep the circle of abstinence strong. Unfortunately, almost no primary prevention is done, mostly because 
there isn't enough personnel to do prevention in communities. On average there is about one counsellor 
for every 500 people. <P>
The key effort seems to be in drug-free communities. Prevention efforts that piggy-back culture on drug 
programs seem to be most effective in schools. The "healing circle" is also thought to be effective. Another 
approach targets additives to dangerous but widely available substances such as glue. <P>
Health promotion is an approach to consider for Aboriginal communities. It focuses on changing an 
individual's environment and sees substance abuse within the same addictive environment. Therefore, a 
variety of problems can be addressed without separating out the effects of each behaviour.<P>
<H6>Discussion</H6>
<I>1.  How effective is prohibition as a prevention strategy? Are there any 
problems or side effects of this kind of approach?
</I>There are some very strict Northern communities that prohibit alcohol in the communities. Although 
the measure successfully controls alcohol, it stimulates other kinds of problems like gasoline sniffing, and 
marijuana or cocaine use. More and more of these problems are surfacing for young people in 
prohibitionist communities.<P>
Some studies have been done (such as Reg Smart's study) of dry reserves that found short-term positive 
effects. We don't know the long-term effects of these programs, however. Prohibition may only work if a 
reserve is far from urban centres. There are always some difficulties in keeping these communities dry. 
Bootleggers want the booze to keep flowing _ some communities made their own alcohol. Some 
researchers blame prohibition for high rates of accidental death because of the traveling back and forth 
between the reserve and urban centres. They get drinking in the car and don't make it home. <P>
Communities see substance abuse problems in many different ways. For example, some communities 
blame these problems on the lack of alternative activities to drinking. They offer recreation and dry 
alternatives such as sports. Of course this kind of programming is picked up under grants other than those 
provided under Health and Welfare.<P>
<I>2.  What kind of prevention programs are being carried out?
</I>Most communities are not practising primary prevention at all. NNADAP has developed a primary 
prevention model for communities to integrate into their existing alcohol and drug programs. It is called 
the Prevention Framework for First Nations Communities. We need to identify communities that have 
become alcohol/drug-safe and develop a primary prevention campaign. The prohibitionist model is losing 
ground at the moment. Some Aboriginal leaders have lost elections because they want dry communities. 
The alternative is to introduce primary prevention. That's the direction we'll be moving in over the next 5-
10 years or so. <P>
Another issue we'll have to deal with soon is the evaluation of these prevention programs. Some 
communities have kept track of their programs in a valid way. We should look at effective programs so we 
can offer similar programs in other communities.<P>
<I>3.  What programs show promise?
</I>One really promising approach is health promotion. These programs are expensive and the findings 
are somewhat questionable too. So far, there isn't any information that says communities change because 
of these programs. The use of substances in a community has natural peaks and valleys that probably have 
nothing to do with these interventions. There is concern that prevention people claim impact when change 
is really a function of natural community activities.<P>
The strongest interventions seem to be education programs delivered before alcohol or drug use begins. 
We found that the most effective programs mix culture and education. The fact-filled literature used in the 
general population seems to work in the opposite direction. These successes and failures should be 
documented.<P>
Most of the well-tested programs are designed to reach the older alcohol abuser, but the problem is with 
the younger kids. We also need properly controlled studies of these programs. One approach that shows 
promise is the server intervention program delivered to hardware store and gas station managers who sell 
solvents, glue and gas. That kind of program should be studied in a controlled manner to examine how 
they work. Prevention programs must focus on children and young people. <P>
We should focus on where the problems lie. Alcohol causes the most lives lost, not smoking. Aboriginal 
people don't live long enough to die of lung cancer. Once we control the alcohol problem, we can deal 
with the adverse effects of tobacco.<P>
We've learned that people change when confronted with the notion that they are harming innocent 
victims. A prevention program should recognize that innocent victims of drinking situations experience 
the consequences of violence, neglect, accidents and crime. Other consequences are child abuse. The most 
terrible example of this is Davis Inlet. In that case, Indian Affairs contributed to the problems in that 
community. They moved the people to Davis Inlet against their wishes. They need a program that will get 
them angry at Aboriginal Affairs instead of at themselves. The community should take responsibility for 
changing their conditions.<P>
<H5>Research Needs and Gaps</H5>
<H6>Opening Remarks</H6>
The presentations highlighted several findings. First, alcohol is the substance of choice among dependent 
Aboriginal peoples. Men are more likely to abuse than women; poor economic situations, educational 
attainment and social pressure seem associated with abuse. Children are severely affected by these 
conditions. Eastern groups may not suffer as much from such difficulties as western groups, where there 
seems to be a greater polarization in the population with abstinent and heavy drinking lifestyles. Although 
there is a real need for national data describing these conditions, such data will likely paint a bleak picture 
of Aboriginal problems and not inform the local situations that should be addressed.<P>
<I>Epidemiology
</I>Although there is a great deal of information about Aboriginal substance abuse, it is based on varied 
populations and is not generalizable. Several important questions have been identified. For example, what 
age does alcohol and drug use begin for each substance. What are the cross addiction patterns and the 
consequences for various substances? We know that the age of first use in Aboriginal communities is 
younger, but we don't know how much younger it is for each substance. What are the specific 
programming needs of subgroups like young people, the elderly, women, urban and rural groups, and 
people with different socio-economic status? <P>
Several barriers prevent the collection of reliable epidemiological information. First, it is difficult to 
gather information on violent deaths or suicide from some communities. Although Medical Services 
Branch of NNADAP may have a registry where they try to record this information, many communities 
won't provide information because they are afraid it might be used against them or in inappropriate ways. 
Mortality figures are generally collected at the nursing stations. <P>
Data are not available on either ambulatory care facilities outside the reserve or on hospitalization figures 
other than in Federal hospitals. Uniform information about these indicators is important to have.<P>
Available information is based on problematic methods. There is little concern for construct validity and 
reliability. These problems are likely the result of unresolved differences between "Native" and "Western" 
Sciences. Despite these problems, there is still a need for quantitative assessment of the consequences of 
substance abuse. For example, patterns of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use should be examined by age, 
gender and tribal affiliation. The role of culture, economics and personality traits in substance abuse 
should also be understood. Information is needed about tribal affiliation and geographic location. They 
need to be assessed with standardized, valid and reliable instruments. Diagnostic and hospital discharge 
data must be improved as well.<P>
The challenge is to gather this information while being sensitive to Aboriginal issues. Methods that 
improve the construct validity and reliability of measures of alcohol and drug use should be developed that 
place lesser emphasis on the written word. The administration of data collection tools must also be 
culturally relevant.<P>
<I>Treatment 
</I>Several questions about treatment were identified. For example, what kind of outreach, follow-up and 
aftercare programs are available at the community level? What programs are most successful and why? 
Are Aboriginal programs culturally independent? Are they generated at the grass roots level? Are there 
Aboriginal specific treatment packages within the provincial health care systems? How are Aboriginal 
treatment programs or prevention programs staffed? What effects do counseling models have on treatment 
results? What are the barriers to rehabilitation? <P>
<I>Evaluation 
</I>Programs should be evaluated to demystify the stereotype of First Nations drinking, to develop a 
general health promotion strategy and to fulfill accountability needs for Treasury Board. Certain 
community-based programs are known to be successful; these programs should be documented and 
transferred to other communities that can benefit from the program. <P>
<I>Community Focus
</I>Although First Nations people are an over-studied population, the findings are rarely fed back into 
communities to improve local conditions. In the future, Aboriginal communities themselves should decide 
what problems are studied. They should control information gathering, data analysis and reporting, to 
ensure that it helps improve community conditions. In circumstances where more global information is 
needed (e.g., national surveys), communities should retain control of the process; community well-being 
should be served as well as the broader interests. They may need training and advice. Partnerships 
between the community and addiction specialists may fill this gap.<P>
<I>Partnerships and Special Assistance
</I>The question is how can partnerships be fostered? The ultimate goal is to facilitate the collection of 
information about substance abuse that empower communities to address the problem and to help them 
become autonomous and self-sufficient in battling these problems. All too often community groups spend 
a great deal of time preparing proposals to develop programs and find that they fall outside pre-established 
funding priorities. These people could benefit from advice by addiction consultants in preparing research 
proposals, evaluations or the dissemination of information.<P>
An example of the ideal partnership between community and scientific experts is the residential school 
research. The problem was identify by a chief who pulled together funds for the research. The community 
was involved in designing the questionnaire, trained to collect and analyze the data and came up with the 
final report. This process let the community live with the end results of the research even though they 
revealed serious issues the community should be concerned about.<P>
Partnerships among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal specialists require that their roles and obligations are 
clearly defined and understood. This education process has already begun by commissioning the 
NNADAP study "What is research". Such a partnership must acknowledge that "expertise" is on both 
sides. Communities have expertise about the problems that affect them. Addiction specialists who 
volunteer their services to First Nations communities will benefit from being able to publish articles about 
their experiences in the community. <P>
Joining scientific expertise with community knowledge increases access to provincial and private funding 
set aside for family violence, women and Aboriginal research. The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse 
may become a filter for finding specialists who can assist in developing proposals to investigate 
community problems and the evaluation of programs.<P>
Other uses of expert assistance were identified. For example, communities might send letters of intent to 
funding agencies describing the proposed research. Travel and consultation with addiction specialists 
could be financed before they prepare a research proposal. Fellowships and secondments to addiction 
agencies could also be created to train Aboriginal researchers. A full range of addiction training is needed 
by Aboriginal peoples to help them become more self-sufficient and autonomous in developing solutions 
to substance abuse problems.<P>
<I>Policy and Programming
</I>Information is needed to develop programs that focus on young people and keeping them alive and 
unimpaired. National data are needed to identify groups that are at risk in the Aboriginal population and 
to identify the programs most suitable for their needs. This information is not currently available. Action-
oriented research should be an integral part of any information gathering activity. This means that if a 
problematic case or situation is identified during information gathering, programs should be initiated to 
address the situation.<P>
<H5>Conclusions</H5>
The group concluded that although the problems of substance abuse have been widely studied in 
Aboriginal communities, we are still some distance from getting at the root causes with programming and 
research. Better information and a solution-oriented approach are needed to improve community 
responses to the conditions created by these problems. <P>
The final question of the day was addressed to First Nations health providers. Would it be fruitful to ask 
First Nations communities to collect uniform information (e.g., a survey) about the use of alcohol and 
other drugs that would serve both community and national purposes? To this end, First Nations leaders 
should convene a national working group to identify the information they need to plan programs and 
services in their communities. First Nations should set a national agenda for examining substance abuse, 
and find ways to measure the full range of the consequences experienced within Aboriginal communities. 
Addiction specialists could help them develop culturally appropriate ways to implement their plan.<P>

The background paper by Kim Scott admirably summarized the literature on Native alcohol and drug 
abuse. That paper, and the subsequent discussions, crystallized what seem to me some major issues 
concerning alcohol and drug abuse and its impact on Native communities.<P>
Alcohol and drug abuse is not only a major problem in most Native communities, but a different problem 
from alcohol and drug abuse in the general population, raising questions about the relevance of knowledge 
and programs developed from research on the general population. Rates of abuse are higher. The usual 
difference of rates between the genders is absent. The pattern of abusive drinking appears to be different. 
The extension of alcohol use and abuse to much younger age groups, including pre-adolescents, is 
different and, most alarmingly, the use of solvents and non-beverage alcohol by children is widespread. 
Finally, the social context differs, including poverty, poor housing, isolation, and health and social 
problems such as child and spousal abuse, violence and suicide. All of these have a lengthy  history and 
afflict an unknown, but high, proportion of Native communities not only in Canada but North America as 
a whole.<P>
Sorting out cause and effect within this complex of social problems is difficult and may not be worthwhile. 
Alcohol and drug abuse contributes in a major way to each of the other aspects of this set of problems, but 
alcohol and drug abuse are also the result of the conditions that these other problems create. The point 
was made that Native communities differ greatly in Aboriginal language and culture as well as in current 
setting, population and socio-economic development. Nevertheless, the complex of social problems, 
including alcohol and drug abuse, is at least very widely, if not universally, shared. The ultimate causes 
must be, therefore, what all these communities share: a history of loss or threatened loss of culture and 
devaluation of cultural identity by the larger society; contemporary social, economic and cultural 
marginalization.<P>
Whatever the ultimate causes, the solutions must come from the communities directly affected. The larger 
society can provide resources. Governments have an obligation to provide the economic, legal and 
political assistance that is necessary to strengthen the Native communities and help them solve the 
problems of marginalization that are the context for substance abuse and its consequences for the family. 
The scientific and medical communities can provide information on what is known about substance abuse, 
on research that might assist the search for solutions to the problem as it exists in Aboriginal 
communities, and provide access to and training in programs that have been effective in other contexts. 
However, only the communities themselves can define the nature of their particular problems and judge 
the relevance of programs and general scientific knowledge. Perhaps the most constructive contribution 
outside experts can provide is a sympathetic but critical questioning of the Native communities' efforts to 
define and address substance abuse problems. Although individuals and communities have the most direct 
and intimate knowledge of their own problems, everyone can profit from editorial assistance. <P>
In this connection, while it is clear that the problems, particularly those involving children and solvent 
abuse, need to be addressed urgently, the need  and the usefulness of descriptive research including survey 
research, should not be downgraded. It is not the highest priority, but it is a priority. Nearly 30 years ago, 
as consultant to the Alcohol Foundation of British Columbia, I met with groups at several Native 
communities in the province and heard accounts of problems with alcohol and other drugs that were very 
similar to those presented in Kim Scott's paper and in the oral accounts of Native participants in the joint 
conference. I thought at the time that little of the research, and less of the programs for alcohol abuse 
conducted in or designed for the non-native community was particularly relevant to the problems that 
were described and that I knew from the literature at the time. I also thought that the solutions to the 
substance abuse problems of Native communities would eventually come with increasing political 
awareness and organization. There has been a considerable increase in political awareness and the 
number of organizations to assert Native claims. <P>
Nevertheless, the problems of alcohol and other substance abuse continue. Have they become more 
prevalent or less prevalent? Has the nature of the problems changed? Is there any relation between 
prevalence and degree of community organization and political action?<P>
No-one seems to know the answer to these questions, because there were no methodologically sound 
surveys available then to compare with more recent surveys, which are still not being conducted. I can 
understand the resistance of the Aboriginal community to the intrusion of researchers with their own 
agendas and to research with no clear relation to the urgent needs of these communities. Any research 
should include representation and participation by Native people and should have the consent of every 
community involved. Indeed, if it is to provide valid information, it must be with Native participation and 
consent and, ideally, at the instigation of representative Aboriginal organizations.<P>
In spite of the thorough and clear presentation in Kim Scott's paper, I have no clear ideal of the proportion 
of Native communities in which substance abuse is an acute problem beyond the level of comparable 
communities in the general population. The proportion is high, but is it universal? I have no clear idea of 
the distribution within individual communities of alcohol and other substance use or the occasions of its 
use. Surely there are differences in the percentage of the population directly involved in substance abuse 
from one community to another, even though the community as a whole is affected. What are the 
environmental or social correlates of differences between communities? Are there any differences related 
to political organization? The answers to all these questions, and others would have implications for the 
kinds of programs that might be effective.<P>
The CCSA Research Advisory Committee's role in this meeting was to learn, first of all, and then to 
contribute by its collective comments, suggestions for approaches to dealing with the problems, including 
research. My own area of expertise in substance abuse is the effect of the context of drinking and the use 
of observational methods. Little of what I know on this topic is applicable, even by extrapolation, to 
conditions of which I have no direct experience. I have indicated above my belief  that the problem of 
substance abuse in the Aboriginal community is simply too different from the problems encountered in the 
populations which most of us have studied to allow any substantive generalizations. We can indicate 
where information is lacking, the questions that need to be asked and the methods for obtaining relevant 
data.<P>
The suggestions for fellowships to train Native students in the concepts and methods of the relevant social 
and epidemiological sciences was a good one but too long-term to meet the immediate needs for 
information as well as programs. My enthusiasm for the suggestion is also tempered by the recognition 
that graduate training in these subjects involves cultural assumptions. If such a program is to be useful in 
addressing the problems of Native communities, as opposed to achieving upward mobility for specific 
individuals, it should be focused on those problems in the first place.<P>

Harm Reduction for Substance Abuse Problems of Native 
People </H3>
<H4>Patricia G. Erickson, Senior Scientist<BR>
Addiction Research Foundation</H4>
<H5>Introduction</H5>
Of the many approaches to be considered in reversing the devastating tide of social and health 
consequences experienced by Native people in Canada, harm reduction offers a useful organizing concept 
in focusing on substance abuse. First of all, harm reduction provides an integrated approach that includes 
alcohol and other drug use, whether licit or illicit, as well as related health-threatening behaviour such as 
unsafe sex while intoxicated. Second, harm reduction strategies, while encompassing a continuum from 
primary prevention to treatment, emphasize appropriate responses falling in the middle ranges where 
harm may be imminent rather than already serious. Third, harm reduction recognizes the importance of 
informal controls lodged in the individual, the family and peer group. Rarely does a community develop 
problems with a locally grown or produced substance that has a tradition of appropriate and controlled 
use; it is a different story when new substances are introduced without this cultural buffer. Fourth, harm 
reduction emphasizes that formal institutional controls such as the criminal justice system, which holds 
the individual responsible for his/her behaviour, may remove the offender from the community but do not 
alter the underlying conditions that fuel substance abuse and related anti-social behaviour. Finally, harm 
reduction appreciates that structural social and economic conditions must be addressed in order to reduce 
the vulnerability of this special population, requiring decisions at the political level.<P>
This brief commentary will outline the background and principles of harm reduction, its applications and 
possible impediments. These remarks will not include inpatient treatment and total abstinence 
approaches.<P>
<H5>Background and Principles</H5>
The public health perspective, rooted in a population-based approach, has been around for about 150 
years. Society's principal goal in health care is to maximize the health and well-being of the populace. 
This is accomplished, in part, through the minimization or elimination of factors that adversely affect 
health, with a special emphasis on society's younger members _ its next generation. Providing a clean 
water supply and immunization were early successful measures. Practically speaking, elimination of the 
dangerous agent is not always possible; therefore, minimization of risk is the focus of effort. Regulatory 
rather than criminal measures are the preferred mode in establishing the least destructive ways to tolerate 
certain activities. For instance, to completely eliminate alcohol and other drugs from society is not 
realistic, but restricting or forbidding access in certain locales, or to certain age groups, or in certain 
activities like driving, may be achievable. The harm reduction model, as applied to substance use issues, is 
a more recent elaboration of these general public health principles that have been prompted, in part, by 
the AIDS epidemic among injection drug users in several countries. Several key concepts relevant to 
policy development have emerged as these approaches have been extended to other forms of individual 
and social harm related to drug use. One feature is that abstinence is not always the only appropriate 
objective of policy. Second, harm reduction strategies recognize that prohibition and enforcement in and 
of itself can generate certain types of harms, at both the individual and societal levels, in direct proportion 
to the vigor of implementation. Third, the drug user is viewed as a member of society, not an outsider, and 
may need treatment and other assistance to re-integrate into the community. Fourth, harm reduction is 
most often a community-based strategy and places as much or more responsibility for effectiveness on 
strategic partnerships than in formal institutional interventions. Fifth, some forms of legal controls and 
their enforcement may be essential for harm reduction but need to be integrated into an overall 
strategy.<P>
<H5>Applications</H5>
Some practical examples of how this approach might apply to substance abuse in Native communities are 
offered. It is emphasized that such alternatives, unlike the criminal justice system, should be culturally 
sensitive and must be attuned to the particular needs and values of any given Native community. It is 
fundamental to harm reduction that psychoactive substances are to be used: less is better than more, a 
milder form is preferable to a more potent one, the least risky mode of administration should be employed, 
and the environment of use should be as safe as possible. Some obvious examples with regard to illegal 
drugs are to avoid the use of needles, to snort rather than smoke cocaine (coca tea is even safer) and to use 
a water pipe when inhaling cannabis. Since it is clear from Kim Scott's review that the legal drugs _ 
alcohol, tobacco and solvents _ pose a much greater threat to the Native population than the illegal ones, 
the emphasis will be on them.<P>
There appears to be a need to establish informal controls on excessive alcohol use. There seem to be few 
cultural norms to reinforce "social" or "controlled" drinking, and adult examples of such a pattern of low-
level drinking behaviour may be relatively rare. An approach relevant to young people _ potential drinkers 
_ would emphasize learning how and why to practise moderation. It would be important to emphasize a 
sense of control over their own choices. For those who may already be more involved with alcohol, some 
interventions have been developed with mainstream groups not noted for moderate alcohol use, e.g. 
college men. Their possible adaptation to the young Native drinker could be pursued. For situations in 
which alcohol use has contributed to some violent or other destructive act, some conciliatory response 
(rather than criminal charging) could be attempted in which the wronged party and the perpetrator, and 
their representatives, meet to discuss suitable redress. This would seem particularly important when 
younger people are the "troublemakers" to avoid a sense of exclusion. This need to gain the approval of 
one's elders and family is a powerful force against many expressions of anti-social behaviour. Harm 
reduction tries to capitalize on such needs.<P>
Education about gasoline and solvent abuse, based on harm reduction, would take a realistic look at the 
risks should such use occur. Emphasis would be placed on the lack of judgment and coordination that can 
result from inhalants _ hence the importance of not using near dangerous places like roads and railway 
tracks. Suffocation from a plastic bag over the user's head also poses a more immediate threat than the 
drug's effects, and attention is paid to what measures to take if one finds a friend is unconscious in these 
circumstances.  impediments would be a mistake to think that harm reduction strategies can begin to undo 
the legacy of social neglect and disorganization in Native Communities in this and preceding centuries. 
<P>
Nevertheless, as Ms. Scott said, until fundamental changes occur, the objective is to keep young Native 
people alive longer. In this regard, a harm reduction approach can suggest more immediate ways to 
minimize some of the most damaging consequences of substance abuse.<P>
One barrier to harm reduction for alcohol might be the abstinence orientation of many key Native 
decision-makers and treatment staff. This is an understandable position given the extreme nature of the 
drinking levels and associated problems in some Native communities. And indeed, alcohol prohibition 
may be the least risky model for any community to adopt. Thus, any program for young people that 
discussed moderation as opposed to abstinence might be viewed negatively. But there is no reason why 
programs cannot value both, while avoiding the "all-or-nothing" approach that encourages the "helpless" 
view that any drinking will lead to loss of control. As noted earlier, it is very difficult to know how to 
introduce and support informal personal and cultural controls on drinking, but polarized views do not 
appear to have been effective in preventing high levels of substance abuse. Another barrier to harm 
reduction might be the assumption (shared with the dominant culture) that illicit drugs are "worse" than 
the legal ones, and deserve punitive responses. While this perception is gradually changing, it is vital to 
address the real harm caused by drugs. For Native people as for the rest of society, alcohol is a far greater 
contributor to health and social harm than all the illegal drugs together. Solvents and other inhalants, too, 
take a significant toll.  In sum, I offer these comments on harm reduction for discussion and feedback, and 
without any wish to pre-empt either other alternatives or the necessary cultural filtration of their 
applicability to the particular perspective of the Native communities. In this troubled and troubling area, I 
am only sure we need as many good ideas as possible.<P>

Defects</H3>
<H4>Mary Jane Ashley, Professor<BR>
Department of Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics<BR>
University of Toronto</H4>
In Canada, Native and non-Native cultures alike place a high value on the health and well-being of 
children. In this regard deep concern about the adverse effects of alcohol on the fetus is widespread. This 
concern was expressed formally at the national level in June 1992 with the publication of Fetal Alcohol 
Syndrome: A Preventable Tragedy by a Standing Committee of the House of Commons (1). This report 
contained 21 recommendations for further action, some of which have already been implemented (2). <P>
It is now well-documented that drinking during pregnancy can result in a wide array of anatomic and 
functional abnormalities in offspring, that is, alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). These defects include 
a pattern of abnormalities known as the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). This syndrome is defined by 
marked growth deficiencies (prenatal and/or postnatal growth retardation with weight and/or length below 
the 10th percentile), central nervous system involvement (including neurological abnormalities, 
developmental delays, behavioural dysfunction, intellectual impairment, and skull or brain malformations) 
and a characteristic face (with short palpebral fissures (eye openings), a thin upper lip, and an elongated, 
flattened mid face and philtrum (the groove in the middle of the upper lip) (3). When some, but not all of 
these abnormalities are found and prenatal alcohol use is being considered as a possible cause, the term 
"possible fetal alcohol effect(s)" (FAE) may be used. It is now recognized that FAS and FAE are life-long 
disorders, progressing predictably into adolescence and adulthood (4).<P>
Whether and to what extent drinking during pregnancy results in alcohol-related birth defects appears to 
depend on a number of factors, some pertaining to the use of the alcohol itself, and others related to 
characteristics of the mother/fetus that either moderate or exacerbate its effects. The amount of alcohol 
consumed, the frequency of drinking, the timing of this consumption in relation to the development of the 
fetus, and the pattern of consumption, for example, binge drinking, all appear to be critical factors. Other 
factors may include the nutritional status of the mother, her age, weight, the number of children she's had, 
smoking habits and use of other drugs, as well as metabolic and physiologic factors. It is also possible that 
some racial groups or subgroups are more susceptible to the adverse effects of alcohol because of 
genetically determined differences in the way alcohol is metabolized. However, there do not appear to be 
any major or consistent racially-based physiologic differences in alcohol metabolism between Natives and 
non-Natives and differences among Natives themselves are as great as those between Natives and non-
Natives (5).<P>
There are no national data on the rate of occurrence of FAS and FAE in Canada. It has been estimated 
conservatively that between one and three cases of FAS occurs in every 3,000 births in western countries, 
meaning that more than 100 babies are born in Canada each year with FAS. The incidence of FAE is 
thought to be much higher (1). Mental handicaps and behavioural problems, including problems with 
learning, attention, memory and problem solving, are among the most debilitating aspects of  and 
FAS/FAE. In this regard, prenatal alcohol exposure is one of the leading known causes of mental 
retardation in western countries (3).<P>
It is asserted that the incidence of FAS in some Native communities is much higher than the rate for 
Canada as a whole. Indeed, the level of FAS and FAE among Native children has been described as a 
"crisis situation" by one Native leader (1). Existing data, although limited both in amount and by 
methodological weaknesses (6), tend to support this assessment. For example, Robinson et al. (7) in a 
study of a Native community in British Columbia found an exceptionally high prevalence rate of 
FAS/FAE (190 per 1,000 children). Two-thirds of affected children in this study were mentally retarded, 
indicating a major health and social problem. Other studies and experiences reported from western 
Canada likewise point to devastating effects in some populations (1). It is not clear, however, how 
generalizable these findings are to other Native communities across Canada.<P>
Clearly, more and better data are needed to accurately and precisely define the magnitude and the extent 
of the FAS/FAE problem in Native communities. Studies by May and colleagues (5) in the United States 
suggest that some Native communities have much higher rates than others, reflecting differences in 
drinking norms. As well, within communities rates may be changing over time, reflecting changes in 
drinking norms.<P>
May and colleagues (5) have attempted to identify characteristics of Native cultural subgroups which may 
be important determinants of either a high or low risk of alcohol problems, including FAS and FAE. They 
found that drinking norms vary substantially by community and by subgroups and that Indian tribes (like 
mainstream cultures) exert a strong influence on drinking norms. These normative patterns are the key 
factors that determine maternal risk of FAS/FAE. Further, they found that communities and subgroups 
which displayed low degrees of social integration, in that a great deal of individual variation in drinking 
habits was permitted, generally were at higher risk for FAS/FAE among their children. To quote: <P>
"They (the tribes) dictate how much, how often, when and under what circumstances 
drinking can occur. Definitions of appropriate and inappropriate behaviour regarding 
drinking are vital considerations in the study and prevention of FAS and FAE in all 
human groups. How male and female roles are defined in a community, especially 
regarding drinking-specific behaviour, will to a great degree determine the rates of FAS 
and FAE. Further, how the individual is attached to or integrated to these norms is 
important." (5)<P>
Success in dealing with FAS/FAE in both Native and non-Native communities will require enhanced 
awareness at all levels and intervention on many fronts. The 21 recommendations in the recent House of 
Commons Report (1), including 3 specific to Native communities, addressed a number of concerns with 
regard to prevention, the identification of high-risk individuals and groups, clinical services for women of 
child-bearing age, and the identification, treatment and care of persons with alcohol-related birth defects. 
The federal government has commented on these recommendations (2). <P>
A key finding from research is that women who have had one child with FAS/FAE are at very much 
increased risk of subsequently having another child with alcohol-related birth defects. Interventions aimed 
at identifying and assisting these women are clearly important in their own right. It has been suggested, 
however, that they also may be an excellent initial focus for more comprehensive community-based 
prevention programs (5). <P>
One such program, started in 1987 to serve Navajo and Hopi Indians in the southwestern United States, 
has been recognized as exemplary by the U.S. Office for Substance Abuse Prevention (8,9). At the primary 
prevention level, the objective of the program was to increase community knowledge and awareness 
through general education and through specific training of community health and social service providers, 
who not only shared their expertise with other members of the community, but also became involved in 
referring clients to a hospital-based treatment program. Secondary prevention was accomplished by 
screening patients in prenatal clinics for alcohol use and providing them with information and education 
about the effects of alcohol on the fetus. Pregnant women identified as heavy drinkers who continued to 
drink during pregnancy, as well as mothers who had already had one FAS/FAE affected child, were 
referred for detailed case management and support. An initial evaluation of this program revealed a high 
level of acceptance by the community and by the women referred for treatment, and considerable success 
in achieving program objectives (9).<P>
Finally, success in preventing FAS and FAE in Native (as in non-Native) communities will be very much 
intertwined with the prevention of alcohol problems in general. In this regard, the determination of Native 
communities across Canada to address and overcome health and social problems, including alcohol abuse, 
is increasing evident, and augurs well for the continuing development of community-based prevention and 
intervention programs.<P>

At the joint meeting of the CCSA and NNADAP Research Advisory Committees on Native substance 
abuse, held in Ottawa on February 20-21, the following plan was proposed and agreed upon.<P>
Whereas:<BR>
(1) the rates of problems associated with the use of alcohol and other psychoactive substances are 
extremely high for Native Canadians,<P>
(2) there is a relative lack of research on the extent and nature of Native substance abuse, and the 
efficiency of prevention and treatment approaches, and<P>
(3) there is an urgent need for technical assistance on research issues by Native groups working within 
their communities on substance abuse problems;<P>
It is agreed that:<BR>
(1) the CCSA and NNADAP jointly promote the development of a research resource network to provide 
technical assistance to Native groups which desire such assistance.<P>
(2) the CCSA and NNADAP agree on the formal participation of NNADAP in the National 
Clearinghouse on Substance Abuse, thereby ensuring access of Native groups to information available 
from the resource centres in the Clearinghouse.<P>
(3) the CCSA and NNADAP promote the development of professional training via special graduate and 
post-doctoral fellowship programmes, the arrangement of Native secondments to the addictions agencies 
and research organizations, and other means.<P>
(4) the expertise of the CCSA staff and the CCSA Research Advisory Committee shall be made available

<H2>Harm reduction:  History and 
Definitions</H2>
Harm-reduction is a relatively new social policy which has gained popularity in recent years, especially in 
Britain and the Netherlands. Although harm reduction can be used as a framework for all drugs, including 
alcohol, it has primarily been applied to injection drug use (IDU) as a way of slowing the spread of 
AIDS.<P>
The first priority of harm reduction is to decrease the negative consequences of drug use. By contrast, drug 
policy in North America has traditionally focused on reducing the prevalence of drug use. Harm reduction 
establishes a hierarchy of goals, with the more immediate and realistic ones to be achieved as first steps 
toward risk-free use or, if appropriate, abstinence.<P>
Drug-taking behaviours result in effects that are either beneficial (as in the case of life-saving medication), 
neutral or harmful. Assigning a positive or negative value - a benefit or a harm - to such effects is subjective 
and open to controversy, but a harm reduction framework at least offers a pragmatic means by which 
consequences can be objectively evaluated.<P>
In the UK, harm reduction can be traced back to the old "British System", which emerged as a result of 
recommendations of the Rolleston Committee of the 1920s. This group of leading British physicians 
concluded that in certain cases maintenance on drugs may be necessary to help drug abusers lead useful 
lives. To this day, injectable opiates are prescribed on a take-home basis in Merseyside, a centre for harm 
reduction policy serving the area around the port city of Liverpool.<P>
The Merseyside model developed in response to an epidemic spread of drug use, particularly heroin, in the 
early 1980s. The Merseyside clinics, pharmacists and police force worked together to establish a unique 
model of harm reduction, a comprehensive approach involving prescription of drugs, syringe exchange and 
helping rather than punishing drug users.<P>
In the early 1980s Amsterdam recognized that drug use is a relapsing disorder and that medical and social 
care must be provided to clear the path toward natural recovery. The city's first needle exchange program in 
1984 was operated by the "Junky Union", a recognized organization of injection drug users. Taking a 
pragmatic and non-moralistic attitude toward drug use, the city developed a variety of harm reduction 
programs.<P>
While harm reduction is a relatively novel idea in North America, one of its earliest formsmethadone 
maintenance programshas operated here since the 1960s. Methadone maintenance for injection drug 
users was seen as harm reduction for society, usually in terms of reducing crime or restoring drug users to 
the workforce. Today, the spread of AIDS in opiate users has led to an urgent re-examination of existing 
methadone programs.<P>
A number of countries and organizations have now adopted harm reduction as both policy and practice. 
The British Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (AMCD) concluded that the spread of HIV is a 
greater danger to individual and public health than drug misuse. The World Health Organization has 
expressed a similar opinion, stating that attempts to reduce drug use must not compromise measures against 
the spread of AIDS. In 1987, the Canadian government adopted harm reduction as the framework for 
Canada's National Drug Strategy (CDS). It defined harm as "sickness, death, social misery, crime, violence 
and economic costs to all levels of government".<P>
<P>
<H2>Injection Drug Use</H2>
In Canada, only three per cent of male AIDS cases to date are related to injection drug use (IDU), but more 
than 10 per cent of female cases are IDU-related. In the United States, more than 20 per cent of reported 
AIDS cases are directly associated with a history of IDU, and in some areas of Europe, IDU accounts for as 
many as 60 per cent of cases. IDU is now associated with the most rapid transmission of the AIDS virus in 
many countries of the world.<P>
The extremely rapid spread of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus, thought to be necessary for AIDS) is a 
concern for IDUs and their sexual partners. Studies in the US and the UK have shown that 60-100 per cent of 
heterosexually acquired HIV is related to IDU, and that at least 40 per cent of IDUs are in relationships with 
non-users. In addition, more than 50 per cent of all pediatric AIDS cases in the US are associated with 
injection drug use by one or both parents.<P>
<P>
<H3>Needle Exchange</H3>
<P><B>
</B>Needle exchanges are a form of harm reduction applied to the enormous risks associated with IDU, 
arising primarily from the sharing of needles. Injectors frequently report sharing syringes because of 
difficulties in obtaining them. This is especially true where laws prohibit syringe possession, or where 
syringes are unavailable when needed (late at night, when buying drugs, or in prison).<P>
Needle exchanges recognize that many IDUs are unable or unwilling to stop injecting, and that intervention 
must occur to reduce the risk of HIV infection. This type of strategy is based on a knowledge and means 
approach to behavioural change: people are provided with information about the changes that are needed 
and also with the means to make these changes - in this case, sterile needles, syringes and other "works" for 
administering drugs, and condoms.<P>
In Canada, exchanges were opened unofficially in Toronto in 1987, and officially in Vancouver in 1989. There 
are now more than 30 exchanges operating across Canada.<P>
There is reasonable evidence that injectors who attend syringe exchanges reduce their risk behaviour. In 
Montréal, the Cactus exchange reported a decrease in use of dirty needles from 37 per cent to 26 per cent 
over six months, and an increase in cleaning (with bleach) from 83 per cent to 93 per cent of occasions. The 
Edmonton exchange reported that the longer users attended the service, the less likely they were to practice 
risky behaviours such as sharing of dirty needles.<P>
Because of the time lag between behaviour and detection of infection there is as yet only limited direct 
evidence that increasing the availability of clean injection equipment reduces the spread of HIV. However, 
there is ample evidence of what happens when clean needles are in short supply. HIV rates in New York 
City, for example, where syringe exchange is still illegal, have reached 60 per cent among IDUs.<P>
There is now also good evidence that syringe exchanges are successful at reaching large numbers of IDUs, 
many of whom are not in touch with other services and who have had little help in the past with drug 
problems. Increasingly cocaine and amphetamine users are coming to the services - a significant point since 
stimulant users are not often attracted to formal treatment services.<P>
There are understandable concerns that harm reduction for IDUs will encourage existing use and help to 
recruit new drug users. As with methadone maintenance (see below), however, there is no evidence of 
increased drug use in any of the communities where syringe exchanges are operating. Estimates from around 
the world suggest that new recruits are not attracted into drug use and that the mean age of injection drug 
users has increased over time.<P>
<P>
<H3>Methadone Maintenance</H3>
<P><B>
</B>Methadone substitution therapy was pioneered in the United States in the early 1960s. A synthetic 
opiate generally taken orally in the form of a syrup, methadone has many of the same properties as heroin 
and morphine. The primary advantage of methadone is that it can reduce users' contact with crime, the black 
market, and contaminated drugs. Because of its long-lasting effects, methadone helps to keep users 
stabilized so that use becomes less frequent.<P>
Methadone keeps clients in treatment, whereas there is a high drop-out rate with other forms of treatment 
such as psychotherapy. Proponents of methadone argue that the routine imposed on the user's life in 
obtaining methadone helps to eliminate a lifestyle that makes other rehabilitation efforts fail.<P>
Methadone maintenance is a good means of preventing health problems such as hepatitis and AIDS. 
Evidence now suggests that heroin users enrolled in methadone maintenance programs may have lower HIV 
seroprevalence than users not enrolled in treatment. There are data which support the effectiveness of 
methadone maintenance programs in reducing high-risk injecting behaviour as well as reducing the risk of 
acquisition of HIV.<P>
It is clear that methadone maintenance has a significant role to play in slowing the spread of AIDS, in 
reducing drug-related crime and associated costs and in the treatment of opiate dependence. However, some 
informed observers have argued that if methadone programs are to be truly cost-effective, some changes are 
needed to attract and retain clients, and to keep them from using other drugs.<P>
For example, since methadone syrup does not provide a "buzz", some clients look for this experience 
elsewhere, using the syrup to keep them stable. One approach to this problem might be to supply 
sufficiently high levels of methadone syrup to prevent relapse to injection. For those who still relapse, 
supplying injectable methadone ampoules, with plenty of clean injection equipment, might be a solution. 
This approach is working successfully in Merseyside, England. However, neither of these approaches has 
met with much approval in places where progress in methadone treatment is equated with low doses of 
methadone instead of with the patient's overall adjustment regardless of dose level.<P>
In a recent review of the role of drug treatment in AIDS prevention in the US, Edith Springer characterizes 
current methadone programs in North America as punitive applications of the "reward and punishment 
system" which sets up clients to lie to staff and prevents staff from counselling clients properly on their 
drug use and sexual behaviours. Oral methadone is the only route of administration provided and staff are 
often poorly trained, especially in counselling. And yet, ". . . while the success rates for drug treatment are 
abysmally low, the staff and administrations continue to blame the clients rather than examine the treatment 
modalities and admit their crudeness and lack of relevance to their clients".<P>
In Holland, methadone had been used in a harm-reduction framework for several years before the peak of the 
AIDS epidemic, with the result that the rate of spread of HIV in drug users and their partners is now lower 
than it otherwise would have been. In Amsterdam, methadone is provided with a minimum of impediments in 
order to contact heroin users, to stabilize them, and to detoxify and treat them. A "methadone bus" program 
is used to distribute methadone throughout the drug-using community, but no take-home dosages are 
provided. Clients are also assisted with problems concerning housing, financial and legal matters. They are 
also provided with regular medical examination.<P>
The primary disadvantages of some of the Dutch programs are reported to be that, like some of the US 
programs, they do not maintain all clients on levels of methadone high enough to prevent use of heroin, and 
they provide nothing other than oral methadone.<P>
In all countries, one of the key factors underlying the success of methadone as a harm reduction measure is 
that it brings users back into the community rather than treating them like outsiders or criminals. This not 
only allows for rehabilitation of users, but it also breaks the drugs-and-crime cycle.<P>
In Canada, several academics have suggested that methadone programs be expanded and made more 
accessible, flexible and liberal. This does not mean that treatment standards should be lowered. They cite 
research from around the world indicating that inflexible, low-level programs do not reduce injection drug 
use. The World Health Organization has recommended that wherever methadone maintenance is practiced 
additional programs be provided with less ambitious goals and objectives for injection drug users who may 
not be willing or able to enter other programs.<P>
Policy makers and programmers are increasingly exploring the need for methadone programs in prisons and 
the advantages of offering methadone treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. Closer links between 
methadone clinics, general hospitals and AIDS clinics are viewed as a means of ensuring a more efficient 
response to the needs of the HIV-infected population.<P>
<P>
<H3>Comprehensive Programs: The Mersey Model</H3>
<P><B>
</B>At present, the only truly comprehensive harm reduction programs are in Merseyside, England. These 
include not only syringe exchange and outreach education, but also prescription of drugs other than 
methadone, and police involvement at several levels. In Merseyside, harm reduction services comprise 
needle exchange, counselling, prescription of drugs, including heroin, and employment and housing 
services. Many levels of service and a wide variety of agencies are involved and services are integrated to 
provide drug users with help when they need it.<P>
Pharmacists play a vital role in the workings of the Merseyside system. Some pharmacists now fill 
prescriptions for smokable drugs in the form of "reefers" which provide an alternative to injection and 
produce the "buzz" that some IDUs crave. To prepare reefers, drugs such as heroin and methadone are 
injected into either herbal or regular cigarettes. Clients who have received injectable prescriptions for more 
than 10 years are now voluntarily switching to reefers in an attempt to stop injecting. In addition to reefers, 
the pharmacists dispense drugs in the form of ampoules, liquid, and aerosols.<P>
At the end of June 1991, Mersey Region had the second lowest rate of HIV-positive IDUs of all 14 English 
regions: eight per million population compared with an English national rate of 34, and a top rate of 136 per 
million in North-West Thames; the rate for the UK as a whole was 51, with Scotland registering a rate of 183 
HIV-positive IDUs per million population. The Merseyside programs have also been successful in reducing 
crime. In 1990 and 1991, the Merseyside police were the only force in the UK to register a decrease in crime 
rates.<P>
<P>
<H2>Prevention of Alcohol Problems</H2>
There is a trend toward harm reduction in recent approaches to the prevention of alcohol-related problems. 
For the past two decades, the control of alcohol problems has focused largely on the maintenance of 
controls over alcohol availability. The rationale for this approach is that problem levels experienced by a 
given population tend to be closely related to overall levels of consumption within that population. In the 
more recent past, however, prevention efforts have focused less on controlling consumption and more on 
reducing the harm associated with consumption.<P>
The new direction is due to a variety of factors, including the accumulation of empirical data suggesting that 
limiting alcohol availability is losing effectiveness as a control measure because alcohol is already so widely 
available. In addition, there is waning support for the single distribution theory of alcohol consumption, 
which holds that the problems caused by excessive drinking should be reduced if all drinkers - even light 
and moderate drinkers - drink less. While it remains true that mean levels of consumption are closely 
correlated with alcohol problems in any society, significant exceptions have been noted and many scientists 
no longer view the single distribution theory as valid.<P>
Another factor is the increasing evidence that regular consumption of small amounts of alcohol may have a 
protective impact on the development of coronary heart disease. The evidence with regard to overall 
mortality is less conclusive. It may be that increased risk of other adverse health consequences may offset 
the potential benefits associated with the regular consumption of small amounts of alcohol. Further, there 
are certain groups of people - youth, for example - who are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of 
alcohol consumption, even at relatively small dosages.<P>
The potential health benefits of moderate drinking, as limited as they may be, call into question the value of 
general health warnings on alcohol containers, and reduce the rationale for strict constraints on alcohol 
availability. However, warning messages regarding specific, demonstrable adverse health effects such as 
alcohol poisoning can still be justified. Other appropriate prevention measures include standard serving 
information, tax policies aimed at the promotion of low-alcohol beverages, and programs aimed at reducing 
heavy drinking occasions. Server training programs in particular have been found to be very effective in 
reducing the problems associated with immoderate drinking.<P>
There is a new perspective on alcohol prevention which targets heavy drinking occasions rather than level 
of alcohol consumption. This perspective focuses on environmental controls such as server intervention 
and preventive education to convince drinkers at all levels of consumption to avoid drinking to intoxication 
and to minimize the harm that may result from drinking. Empirical support for this harm reduction approach 
to alcohol problem prevention derives from an analysis of data from the National Alcohol and Other Drugs 
Survey of 1989. The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse found that the number of heavy drinking 
occasions is a stronger predictor of drinking problems than is level of consumption. Indeed, the likelihood of 
experiencing drinking problems is greater for a moderate level drinker who occasionally drinks immoderately 
than for a high-level consumer who rarely or never drinks immoderately.<P>
This finding may be associated with physical tolerance and the tendency for high-volume drinkers to 
develop social supports and other mechanisms to minimize the adverse consequences of their drinking. 
Over time, heavy drinking will increase the risk of chronic health effects such as liver cirrhosis. Nonetheless, 
for many of the more acute problems such as impaired driving, alcohol-related family dysfunction, and 
employment problems, it is the relatively low-level consumer who contributes substantially to problem 
levels.<P>
The potential benefits of moderate drinking, taken together with recent empirical evidence on the importance 
of heavy drinking occasions as a predictor of alcohol problems, give impetus to a new approach  to the 
prevention of alcohol-related harms. The new approach would target heavy drinking occasions and the 
adverse consequences of drinking rather than drinking itself. For example, in prevention education, it would 
focus on changing public acceptance of intoxication and drunken behaviour rather than convincing 
moderate drinkers to reduce their consumption or abstain.<P>
<P>
<H3>Moderate Drinking Programs</H3>
<P><B>
</B>One means of reducing the harms associated with alcohol is to teach people to consume alcohol in a 
moderate or sensible manner. Martha Sanchez-Craig of the Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario has 
developed such a program and has tested and refined it with many different groups over several years. The 
program is designed for problem drinkers who experience difficulties with their health, personal 
relationships, and ability to work effectively and drive safely, but who don't see themselves as being 
severely dependent and requiring conventional treatment with its insistence on abstinence.<P>
The program follows five steps to sensible drinking:<P>
1.  <B>Keeping track</B>: Just as people use a scale when they are trying to lose weight, drinkers need a 
measure of progress when they are trying to cut down. Participants are required to track, on a daily basis, 
how much they are drinking and how they are avoiding over-drinking.<P>
2.  <B>Pacing</B>: Participants are instructed to measure drinks, dilute them, sip, not gulp them, alternate 
drinks with soft drinks, have a snack with drinks and have no more than one drink an hour.<P>
3.  <B>Spending time on other things</B>: Clients are instructed to use drinking time for other things they 
enjoy such as walking, seeing movies, reading or learning a new skill.<P>
4.  <B>Staying alert</B>: Since there will be times when the pressure to drink will be strong, clients are 
taught a number of tips. These include resisting temptation through self-talk such as "I don't want to ruin 
my record", refusing drinks without feeling anti-social, and leaving the situation if they are having 
trouble.<P>
5.  <B>Not using alcohol to cope</B>: Participants are taught that alcohol will only make their problems 
worse and that if they are using alcohol too much it is likely they are using it to make themselves feel better 
or to do things that they otherwise find difficult.<P>
The moderate drinking program, also known as "Drink Wise", has proven very effective as a brief, low-cost, 
non-residential means of reducing alcohol-related harm. Harms reduced include social problems, and mental 
and physical disorders.<P>
<P>
<H3>Standard Drink Information</H3>
<P><B>
</B>One obvious means of reducing drug-related harm is to provide consumers with factual information 
that allows them to better regulate their consumption. "Standard serving" information does this by stating 
the amount of ethyl alcohol in the container in relation to the amount of alcohol in a normal or "standard" 
serving. Normally the size of the serving is chosen to correspond to the amounts of alcohol typically found 
in standard servings of regular-strength beer, wine and spirits, which are often approximately equal.<P>
It has been suggested that providing standard serving information would better enable drinkers and servers 
to avoid intoxication, enable drivers to be sure that they are below the legal blood alcohol level for driving 
and assist anyone who wished to drink at levels defined as "low risk" by health experts.<P>
There is relatively little research available on the need or likely impact of providing standard serving 
information to consumers. In Australia, Tim Stockwell and his colleagues found that without standard unit 
information, consumers were unable to accurately judge the amount of alcohol they consumed, and that 
consumers were very receptive to the idea of standard serving information. Standard serving information in 
terms of grams of alcohol has been introduced in Australia. Standard unit information has also been 
introduced on a voluntary basis by Australian wine producers and a chain of grocery stores in the UK.<P>
In Canada, the Association of Canadian Distillers commissioned a study by Decima Research which 
examined issues related to standard serving information. The research, involving a small number of subjects 
in four focus groups, found that:<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>There was widespread support for factual information regarding the alcohol content of different 
beverages. There is considerable confusion regarding the interpretation of current information on "per cent 
alcohol by volume".
<LI>The subjects, who were all adults, felt that better information on standard servings would be 
particularly useful for youth who are just beginning to use alcohol .
<LI>Consumers are supportive of industry activities deemed to be effective in promoting moderate drinking.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Server Intervention Programs</H3>
One way to reduce the harms associated with immoderate alcohol consumption is to train servers to 
recognize and limit impairment in their patrons. The Server Intervention Program (SIP) was developed by the 
Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario and was endorsed by the Liquor Licence Board of Ontario 
(LLBO). The LLBO itself developed a half-day workshop as a requirement for new licensees, and it is 
currently implementing mandatory training of all persons who serve alcohol in licensed establishments in 
Ontario. British Columbia has already implemented a mandatory server training program.<P>
Server training typically consists of a short workshop for servers, with longer training sessions for owners 
and managers. Topics include civil liability, the effects of alcohol, factors which influence impairment, how 
to recognize and prevent intoxication, and how to manage an intoxicated patron. It is important that 
management support the program and institute house policies which promote a moderate environment.<P>
<P>
<H3>Other Measures</H3>
<P><B>
</B>One of the more interesting and provocative applications of harm reduction principles involves making 
alcohol more easily available to alcoholics. This unusual step was taken by the Alberta Liquor Control 
Board (ALCB) in Edmonton in July, 1991 in an attempt to reduce the consumption of non-beverage alcohol 
products such as household cleaners and hairspray. Health and social service workers observed that street 
people living in the city's inner core used these potentially lethal substitutes because they were available 
from corner stores at times when liquor outlets were closed. The problem was especially prevalent in the 
early morning when the effects of withdrawal were most acute. The ALCB agreed to open one of its 
downtown outlets 2 1/2 hours earlier on a trial basis. The early openings were deemed a success and the 
initiative was continued. In April 1993, the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission announced a similar plan 
for downtown Winnipeg. Some American states claim to have completely eliminated solvent abuse by 
making cheap alcohol available to abusers.<P>

<H2>Health Promotion and Education</H2>
Harm reduction acknowledges that policy makers, educators and health promoters can tell drug users how 
and why they should prevent harm, and provide them with the means to do it, but only the users themselves 
can actually prevent the harm. Research has clearly shown that users will change their behaviour in 
response to information about safer use, and that this change is greater if skills training as well as the means 
to ensure safety are provided.<P>
Until the 1980s (and even currently in the US), the main response to drug use among young people in many 
countries has been school and media drug education programs based on a primary prevention ("Say No to 
Drugs") approach. These approaches usually present information intended to demonstrate the adverse 
consequences of drug use. Criticism has been leveled at this process because of its tendency to exaggerate 
the dangers and to perpetuate certain convenient stereotypes. In addition, the "just say no" approach 
assumes, against evidence to the contrary, that a child's decision not to use drugs becomes much easier 
once he or she is acquainted with the consequences. In fact, evaluations of primary prevention have shown 
that it has little or no impact on whether young people use drugs. Indeed, some studies suggest that 
excessive use of primary prevention may actually encourage drug use by creating a sense of mystique 
around the subject which appeals to children's natural curiosity.<P>
Primary prevention assumes that drug use is abnormal and that drug users are deficient in knowledge, self-
esteem or skills. Yet some studies show that it is those with high self-esteem who are more likely to 
experiment with drugs. Moreover, research indicates that experimentation is an extremely poor predictor of 
long-term use or abuse. Primary prevention approaches also ignore the pleasure and other benefits of drug 
use and fail to acknowledge that decisions to try drugs are often expressions of independence. This 
"deviancy amplification" divides users and non-users, and works against meaningful dialogue with adults. It 
does nothing to decrease harm and increase safety.<P>
The harm reduction approach to education focuses on non-judgmental information about different drugs, 
their properties and effects, about the law and legal rights, about how to reduce risks, and where to get help 
if needed. It helps youth to develop a wide range of skills in assessment, judgment, communication, 
assertiveness, conflict resolution, decision-making and safer use.<P>
A number of countries have begun to apply the principles of harm reduction education to all drugs. For 
example, a wide-reaching harm reduction model of drug education and prevention is being developed in the 
UK. It is grounded in the realities of young people's drug use, and has realistic and practical aims. It 
recognizes that harm reduction education is about drugs rather than against drugs. Teaching begins in early 
years around familiar substances other than drugs, and emphasizes that most of the things we consume 
have the potential for both harm and benefit depending on the way we use them.<P>
Harm reduction education is based on humanitarianism, pragmatism and a scientific public health approach. 
The principles of harm reduction drug education are that drug use is normal; it is associated with benefits as 
well as risks; it cannot be eliminated altogether, but the harms can be reduced; many young people grow out 
of drug use; education should be non-judgmental; it requires an open dialogue with the young and respect 
for people's right to make their own decisions; and it emphasizes positive peer support, not 
divisiveness.<P>

<H2>Law Enforcement Options</H2>
<H3>Problem-Solving Policing in Montréal</H3>
An innovative pilot project mounted by police to help a Montréal neighbourhood troubled by drug-related 
crime appears to have struck a good balance between suppression of the drug supply and reduction of 
demand. The Montréal Urban Community (MUC) police program in the city's Parc Extension district uses a 
get-tough approach with people caught selling drugs while offering treatment instead of jail to those found 
in simple possession.<P>
"Parc Ex", as the area is known, was overrun with petty crime, drug trafficking and delinquency when the 
MUC police launched the program in April, 1992. A random survey conducted in the neighbourhood 
indicated that residents were immobilized by fear and that an escalation in crime rates was inevitable. A 
special team of officers trained in "problem-solving policing" was put in place full time to attempt to reverse 
the neighbourhood's downward spiral into crime, and to give residents a greater sense of personal 
safety.<P>
The police visited drug treatment centres in the area to develop a better understanding of how they work 
and to meet addicts in treatment - the district has a high proportion of heroin users. On the street, police 
offered drug users support and assistance as an alternative to arrest for possession. Agreements were 
struck with detox and treatment centres in the area to allow people needing help to be referred there by 
police.<P>
Evaluations carried out during the year-long pilot project indicated such a high level of success that the 
Parc Ex program has been renewed and is being extended to other neighbourhoods.<P>
<P>
<H3>Cautioning in Merseyside</H3>
The Merseyside police in the UK have become national leaders in developing a cooperative harm-reduction 
strategy with the regional health authority to improve the prevention and treatment of drug problems, 
particularly with respect to the spread of HIV infection among IDUs. The police sit on health authority drug 
advisory committees and employ health authority officers on police training courses involving the 
drugs/HIV issue. They have also agreed not to conduct surveillance on treatment centres, to refer arrested 
drug offenders to services, to not charge for possession of syringes to be exchanged, and to publicly 
support syringe exchange.<P>
A key feature of the Merseyside police strategy has been to use resources to deal with drug traffickers while 
operating a cautioning policy toward drug users. Cautioning involves taking an offender to a police station, 
confiscating the drug, recording the incident, and formally warning the offender that any further unlawful 
possession of drugs will result in prosecution in court. The offender must also meet certain conditions, such 
as not having a previous drug conviction and not having an extensive criminal record. The offender is also 
given information about treatment services in the area, including syringe exchanges.<P>
The first time offenders are cautioned, they are not given a criminal record. On the second and third 
occasions they are sent to court and fined for possession of small quantities or sentenced for possession of 
large amounts. If an addict becomes registered by getting in touch with service agencies, then he or she is 
legally entitled to carry drugs for personal use. The overall effect of this policy is to steer users away from 
crime and possible imprisonment.<P>
<P>
<H2>The Future</H2>
Interest in harm reduction world-wide has increased greatly in recent years, in part because of the advent of 
the International Conference on the Reduction of Drug-Related Harm in Liverpool, England, in 1990. At the 
Fourth International Conference in Rotterdam in March, 1993, Dr. Marcus Grant of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) acknowledged the progress that harm reduction approaches have made toward 
"acceptability, even respectability". A mark of that new-found respectability is the fact that the Conference 
is coming to North America for the first time in March, 1994.<P>
Harm reduction is a humane, cost-effective and ultimately sensible way to deal with drug-related problems. 
However, much work remains to be done to bring it to all who need it. Many barriers stand in the way of this 
effort. In his address to the Fifth International Conference, Dr. Grant emphasized that harm reduction is "for 
the whole world, not just the rich". One of the challenges for the future is to bring harm reduction to the 
developing world. Dr. Grant also expressed concern that society is too "battle-fatigued" by drug issues to 
look beyond the extremes of prohibition and blanket legalization. Both options are too drastic, whereas harm 
reduction can provide a balance which does not now exist.<P>
Among barriers to acceptance of harm reduction in many countries is a widespread devotion to a limited 
definition of idealism. Harm reduction accepts that some harm is inevitable, whereas the "ideal" of zero-
tolerance excludes all compromise and sets impossible goals. In North America, total abstinence has long 
been seen as the only acceptable goal of treatment for abuse of legal drugs and the only acceptable 
"normal" state with respect to illicit drugs. Harm reduction expands those options, but in no way precludes 
the possibility of abstinence.<P>
Society's reluctance to view drug use as a legitimate form of risk-taking poses another significant barrier to 
acceptance of harm reduction. While societies tolerate and even encourage some far more dangerous forms 
of risk-taking (such as car racing, mountain climbing, boxing and bungee jumping), drug-taking is singled 
out as something inherently and primordially evil. Harm reduction, because it accepts the possibility of 
drug-taking under certain circumstances, is often viewed as promoting intolerable behaviour.<P>
Religious opposition, public apathy and confusion around drug policy, and a growing inability of nations to 
intervene in domestic social issues because of international trade and other agreements all present obstacles 
to the adoption of harm reduction principles. Because it operates in the grey areas between extremes, harm 
reduction is not easily defined and promoted. It raises many legitimate questions: Who decides what 
constitutes  a "harm" and in what order should harms be reduced? The prescribing of injectable drugs, for 
example, can reduce the risk of HIV and the rate of acquisitive crime, but other evidence suggests it might 
also prolong the habit of injecting. Which course of action is more desirable and for whom?<P>
Harm reduction does not provide clear-cut answers and quick solutions, but it has the capacity, if properly 
applied, to address difficult problems while not compromising the quality and integrity of human life in all its 
rich and diverse complexity. As the motivating principle behind Canada's Drug Strategy, it charts a 
pragmatic and realistic course for this country with respect to drug policy. It also obligates us to more 
clearly define harm reduction approaches and to carefully evaluate their impact. In the end, these 
approaches will stand as both a product and a measure of our humanity.<P>

l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies</H3>
<I>Les opinions exprimées dans la présente publication n'engagent que leurs auteurs, car elles ne représentent pas nécessairement celles du Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies.</I><BR CLEAR=left>
<HR>
<H2>La réduction des méfaits : évolution et 
définitions</H2>
La réduction des méfaits est une approche sociale relativement récente qui, depuis quelques années, gagne 
en popularité, particulièrement en Grande-Bretagne et aux Pays-Bas.  Même si la réduction des méfaits 
peut s'étendre à l'ensemble des toxicomanies, y compris l'alcool, cette approche a surtout été appliquée à 
l'utilisation de drogues injectables (UDI) dans le but de ralentir la propagation du SIDA.<P>
La première priorité de la réduction des méfaits vise à atténuer les répercussions négatives afférentes à 
l'usage des drogues.  Ce modèle contraste avec celui mis de l'avant en Amérique du Nord qui vise avant 
tout à diminuer l'usage des drogues.  La réduction des méfaits repose sur une hiérarchisation des objectifs 
selon laquelle on doit s'attaquer, en premier lieu, aux objectifs les plus réalistes et les plus immédiats de 
façon à éliminer les risques liés à l'usage des drogues tout en ne rejetant pas la notion d'abstinence.<P>
Les comportements associés aux drogues peuvent être bénéfiques (consommation de médicaments qui 
prolongent la vie), neutres ou dommageables.  Accoler une étiquette positive ou négative est jugé par 
plusieurs comme un geste purement subjectif et sujet à la controverse.  Le concept de réduction des 
méfaits offre, quant à lui, un moyen pratique d'évaluer les répercussions de façon objective. <P>
En Grande-Bretagne, le concept de réduction des méfaits remonte au «système britannique» qui a vu le 
jour durant les années 20, suite aux recommandations du Comité Rolleston.  Le comité, composé de 
médecins éminents, a reconnu qu'il valait mieux fournir, dans certaines situations, des drogues illégales 
pour que le toxicomane puisse continuer àmener une vie utile.  Encore de nos jours, on prescrit aux 
toxicomanes d'habitude à Merseyside des doses par injection qu'ils peuvent s'administrer eux-mêmes à la 
maison; cette localité, sise à proximité de la ville portuaire de Liverpool, sert de lieu d'expérimentation 
pour l'application de la politique de réduction des méfaits en Grande-Bretagne.<P>
La localité de Merseyside a été à l'origine de cette nouvelle approche parce que l'usage des drogues y 
atteignait, au début des années 80, des proportions épidémiques, particulièrement l'héroïne.  Les cliniques, 
les pharmaciens et la sûreté de Merseyside ont travaillé conjointement à l'élaboration d'un modèle 
particulier de réduction des méfaits fondé sur une approche intégrée; celle-ci cherche avant tout à éviter de 
punir les toxicomanes et elle met de l'avant la prescription de drogues, l'approvisionnement de seringues 
propres et d'autres mesures d'aide.<P>
Au début des années 80, la ville d'Amsterdam a convenu que l'usage des drogues était un désordre 
récurrent et qu'il fallait apporter des remèdes médicaux et sociaux pour favoriser la réadaptation naturelle.  
Le premier programme d'échange de seringues dans cette ville a débuté en 1984 et il était géré par le 
Junky Union, une association qui regroupait les toxicomanes.  Amsterdam a donc adopté une attitude 
pragmatique et non moralisatrice àl'égard des drogues et il s'en est suivi toute une gamme de programmes 
axés sur la réduction des méfaits.<P>
Même si cette approche est relativement nouvelle en Amérique du Nord, il n'en reste pas moins que l'une 
des premières tentatives de réduire les méfaits, les programmes de maintien au méthadone, est toujours en 
vigueur sur ce continent et, cela, depuis les années 60. En effet, l'administration de doses de maintien au 
méthadone constituait pour la société d'alors un moyen de réduire les méfaits, notamment la criminalité, 
et d'aider les toxicomanes à réintégrer le marché du travail.  De nos jours, la propagation du SIDA chez 
les toxicomanes d'accoutumance met en relief la nécessité de réexaminer le plus tôt possible nos 
programmes de maintien au méthadone.<P>
Plusieurs pays et organisations se sont dotés de politiques et de mesures portant sur la réduction des 
méfaits. À titre d'exemple, le Conseil consultatif de Grande-Bretagne sur l'usage non approprié des 
drogues (AMCD) a convenu que la propagation du VIH représentait un danger beaucoup plus grand pour 
la santé du public et des personnes que l'usage non autorisé de drogues.  L'Organisation mondiale de la 
santé a exprimé un point de vue analogue en soulignant que les politiques fondées sur la réduction de 
l'usage des drogues ne doivent pas atténuer les mesures destinées à prévenir la propagation du SIDA. En 
1987, le gouvernement canadien s'est prononcé en faveur du concept de réduction des méfaits dans le 
cadre de sa stratégie nationale antidrogue.  Par méfaits, on entend généralement, «les maladies, les décès, 
les misères sociales, les crimes, la violence et les coûts économiques que ceux-ci imposent à tous les 
niveaux de gouvernements».<P>
<P>
<H2>L'utilisation de drogues injectables</H2>
Au Canada, à peine 3 p. 100 des cas de SIDA chez les hommes sont reliés àl'utilisation de drogues 
injectables (UDI), comparativement à 10 p. 100 chez les femmes.  Aux États-Unis, plus de 20 p.100 des 
cas de SIDA sont liés sous une forme ou une autre àl'utilisation de drogues injectables et, dans certaines 
régions d'Europe, cette proportion atteint même 60 p. 100.  Bref, cette pratique est en grande partie 
responsable de la propagation vertigineuse du SIDA dans plusieurs pays du monde.<P>
Cette propagation rapide du VIH (Virus d'immunodéficience acquise chez l'humain) est non seulement 
néfaste pour les toxicomanes, mais aussi pour leurs partenaires sexuels. Des études réalisées au États-Unis 
et au Royaume-Uni ont démontré qu'entre 60 et 100 p. 100 des cas d'hétérosexuels atteints du VIH étaient 
dus à l'utilisation des drogues injectables et au moins 40 p. 100 d'entre eux maintenaient des contacts avec 
des non utilisateurs de drogues injectables.  De plus, au-delà de 50 p. 100 des cas d'enfants atteints du 
SIDA aux États-Unis étaient imputables au fait que l'un ou l'autre des parents, ou les deux à la fois, 
utilisaient des drogues injectables.<P>
<P>
<H3>Programmes d'échange de seringues</H3>
Les programmes d'échange de seringues constituent un moyen de réduire les méfaits ou les risques liés à 
l'utilisation des drogues injectables puisque les toxicomanes ont souvent l'habitude de partager les 
seringues entre eux.  Une des raisons invoquées parmi les personnes qui adhèrent à cette pratique a trait 
aux difficultés de s'en procurer. Cela est particulièrement vrai dans les endroits où la loi prohibe la 
possession de seringues et lorsqu'il est difficile d'en obtenir au moment opportun (tard le soir, lors de 
transactions de drogues ou en prison).<P>
On s'est rendu compte que bon nombre de personnes qui s'adonnent à cette pratique ne peuvent pas où ne 
désirent pas s'arrêter et qu'il faut donc à tout prix prendre les moyens pour réduire les risques d'infection 
par le VIH.  Cette approche repose sur l'accès àl'information et la mise en place de moyens capables de 
modifier les comportements àrisques, tels que l'usage d'aiguilles et de seringues propres et l'utilisation du 
condom.<P>
Au Canada, le premier programme d'échange de seringues a débuté officieusement à Toronto en 1987 et 
de façon officielle à Vancouver en 1989. Il existe maintenant plus de 30 programmes d'échanges à travers 
le pays. <P>
Il a été démontré que les toxicomanes qui s'adonnent aux programmes d'échange de seringues réduisent 
considérablement leurs comportements à risques.  À Montréal, on a constaté, dans le cadre du programme 
Cactus, une diminution de 37 à 26 p. 100 dans l'utilisation d'aiguilles souillées sur une période de six mois 
tandis que l'utilisation de seringues propres (avec agent de blanchiment) est passée de 83 à 93 p. 100.  Les 
responsables du programme d'échange d'Edmonton se sont rendus compte que plus longtemps un 
toxicomane utilise leurs services, moins ses chances sont grandes de recourir à des comportements à 
risques, tels que le partage d'aiguilles souillées.<P>
En raison de l'écart qui sépare le comportement d'une personne et la détection de l'infection, nous ne 
disposons pas encore de preuves directes qu'un accès plus grand à du matériel d'injection propre réduit la 
propagation du SIDA.  Toutefois, il existe beaucoup d'indications qui font état des répercussions lorsque 
des seringues propres ne sont pas disponibles.  À New York, par exemple, où les programmes d'échange 
sont prohibés par la loi, le taux d'infection par le VIH atteint 60 p. 100 chez les utilisateurs de drogues 
injectables. <P>
D'autres recherches ont aussi démontré que les programmes d'échange de seringues permettaient de 
rejoindre un grand nombre d'utilisateurs de drogues injectables qui, dans le passé, n'ont pas reçu d'aide 
pour traiter leur toxicomanie.  On a remarqué qu'un nombre accru de cocaïnomanes et d'habitués des 
amphétamines avaient recours aux programmes d'échange de seringues, un facteur très important puisque 
de tout temps les utilisateurs de stimulants n'ont été que peu attirés par les centres de traitement 
officiels.<P>
D'aucuns craignent que l'approche de réduction des méfaits incite d'autres personnes à s'adonner à la 
drogue.  Comme pour le cas des programmes de maintien au méthadone (voir plus bas), il n'existe aucune 
preuve d'augmentation de la consommation de drogue dans les collectivités où prévalent des programmes 
d'échange de seringues.  Des données recueillies partout à travers le monde ont démontré que les 
nouveaux adeptes de la drogues ne sont pas attirés par de telles mesures, d'autant plus que l'âge moyen des 
utilisateurs de drogues injectables n'a cessé d'augmenter au cours des ans.<P>
<H3>Programmes de maintien au méthadone</H3>
Le méthadone est une thérapie de substitution qui a été lancée aux États-Unis au début des années 60.  Ce 
narcotique synthétique, qui est ordinairement absorbé sous forme de sirop, renferme plusieurs des 
propriétés de l'héroïne et de la morphine.  Il permet de réduire les contacts que maintiennent souvent les 
toxicomanes avec le crime, le marché noir et les drogues contaminées.  En raison de ses effets prolongés, 
le méthadone permet aussi de stabiliser le toxicomane et de réduire sa consommation.<P>
Contrairement aux autres types de thérapie, y compris les psychothérapies, les utilisateurs de méthadone 
sont plus assidus au traitement prescrit.  Certains prétendent que la routine imposée aux utilisateurs de 
méthadone pour obtenir leur traitement élimine les comportements qui, très souvent, sont responsables de 
l'échec d'autres thérapies.<P>
Le méthadone est aussi un excellent moyen de prévenir des problèmes de santé, tels que l'hépatite ou le 
SIDA.  Des études ont démontré que le taux de prévalence du VIH chez les héroïnomanes inscrits aux 
programmes de maintien au méthadone est inférieur à celui des personnes non inscrites.  D'ailleurs, il 
existe des données qui indiquent que ces programmes contribuent à réduire les risques élevés liés à 
l'utilisation de drogues injectables et à la contamination par le VIH.<P>
Un fait demeure.  Le méthadone peut jouer un rôle significatif pour ralentir la propagation du SIDA et 
réduire les crimes liés à la drogue et les énormes coûts associés au traitement des toxicomanes 
d'accoutumance.  Toutefois, certains spécialistes de la question prétendent que si les programmes de 
maintien au méthadone sont pour avoir des effets bénéfiques et diminuer les coûts, il faudra trouver les 
moyens d'attirer un plus grand nombre de toxicomanes et éviter que ces derniers aient recours à d'autres 
drogues.<P>
Étant donné que le sirop de méthadone n'apporte pas toute la «sensation» que recherchent les 
toxicomanes, certains d'entre eux utilisent, en effet, d'autres drogues tout en continuant à recourir au 
sirop.  Une solution pourrait être d'administrer des doses plus fortes de sirop de méthadone pour éviter que 
les utilisateurs rechutent ou de leur fournir des ampoules de méthadone et du matériel d'injection propre.  
De telles mesures fonctionnent très bien à Merseyside, en Angleterre.  Il reste néanmoins qu'aucune de ces 
approches n'a eu beaucoup de succès dans les localités où l'on se contente d'administrer de faibles doses de 
méthadone plutôt que de chercher à stabiliser le patient, peu importe la dose requise. <P>
Lors d'un examen mené récemment sur le rôle que pourrait jouer le traitement des toxicomanes dans la 
prévention du SIDA aux États-Unis, Edith Springer a qualifié les programmes d'entretien au méthadone 
en Amérique du Nord comme l'application punitive du système «de gratification et de punition»; selon 
elle, le système actuel oblige en quelque sorte les clients à mentir aux intervenants des programmes et 
empêche par le fait même ces derniers de leur prodiguer des conseils appropriés sur l'usage des drogues et 
leurs comportements sexuels.  Le méthadone sous forme orale est la seule méthode à laquelle on a recours 
et les intervenants sont souvent mal formés, notamment en ce qui a trait à leurs fonctions de conseillers.  
Et Mme Springer de souligner, «...pendant que le taux de succès remporté par les traitements de 
toxicomanies demeure extrêmement bas, le personnel et les autorités responsables des programmes 
continuent d'en imputer le blâme aux clients plutôt que de se pencher sur les modalités de traitement et 
d'admettre ses inaptitudes et son insuffisance face aux besoins des clients».<P>
Aux Pays-Bas, on utilise le méthadone dans le cadre de la stratégie de réduction des méfaits depuis déjà 
plusieurs années, avant même l'avènement de l'épidémie actuelle de SIDA et, de nos jours, le taux de 
propagation du VIH parmi les toxicomanes et leurs partenaires y est de beaucoup inférieur à celui auquel 
on se serait normalement attendu.  ÀAmsterdam, on distribue du méthadone, sans trop de formalités, pour 
maintenir le contact avec les héroïnomanes, pour stabiliser et désintoxiquer ces derniers et leur apporter le 
traitement approprié.  On se sert «de l'autobus méthadone» pour distribuer les doses aux toxicomanes dans 
les quartiers où ils se rassemblent, mais on ne permet pas d'apporter de doses à la maison.  Les 
intervenants du programme leur prodiguent aussi des conseils visant à solutionner les problèmes de 
logement et leurs difficultés financières et légales.  Les toxicomanes inscrits aux programmes sont aussi 
invités à subir un examen médical àintervalles réguliers.<P>
Selon certaines personnes, les principaux inconvénients de certains programmes néerlandais, tout comme 
certains programmes américains, proviennent du fait que le méthadone est administré seulement par voie 
orale et qu'ils ne fournissent pas de doses suffisamment élevées pour prévenir le recours à l'héroïne.<P>
Dans tous les pays, l'un des principaux facteurs qui sous-tend le succès du méthadone en tant que mesure 
de réduction des méfaits est sa capacité de rapprocher les toxicomanes de la communauté plutôt que de les 
traiter comme des étrangers ou des criminels.  Non seulement cette approche favorise-t-elle la 
réintégration sociale des toxicomanes, elle fait aussi échec au cycle drogues/crimes.<P>
Au Canada, plusieurs spécialistes suggèrent d'étendre les programmes de méthadone et de rendre ceux-ci 
plus accessibles, plus souples et plus libéralisés.  Cela ne revient pas à dire qu'il faille en réduire les 
normes de traitement. Ils citent, à l'appui de leur avancé, la recherche menée partout à travers le monde 
qui indique clairement que les programmes rigides et de peu d'ampleur ne réussissent pas à diminuer 
l'utilisation de drogues injectables.  L'Organisation mondiale de la santé a recommandé dans les pays où il 
existe des programmes de maintien au méthadone de mettre sur pied d'autres programmes, à échelle plus 
réduite, à l'intention des utilisateurs de drogues injectables qui ne souhaitent pas ou qui ne peuvent être 
admis à d'autres programmes. <P>
Les décideurs et les responsables des programmes s'interrogent de plus en plus sur la nécessité d'implanter 
des programmes d'entretien au méthadone en milieu carcéral et de présenter cette forme de traitement 
comme une alternative aux sentences de prison. L'établissement de liens plus étroits entre les cliniques de 
méthadone, les centres hospitaliers et les cliniques de SIDA peut aussi satisfaire les besoins des personnes 
infectées par le virus du VIH.<P>
<P>
<H3>Programmes intégrés : le modèle de 
Merseyside</H3>
À l'heure actuelle, le seul programme intégré de réduction des méfaits se trouve àMerseyside, en 
Angleterre.  Il comprend non seulement des programmes d'échange de seringues et d'intervention 
communautaire, mais aussi des drogues prescrites par ordonnance, autre que le méthadone;  les autorités 
policières y participe à tous les niveaux. À Merseyside, les services de réduction des méfaits prennent la 
forme d'échange de seringues, de conseils, de prescription de drogues, y compris l'héroïne, des services de 
recherche d'emploi et de logement.  Tous ces services sont dispensés par plusieurs agences, mais ils sont 
intégrés de telle sorte que les toxicomanes peuvent recevoir de l'aide lorsqu'ils en ont besoin.<P>
Les pharmaciens jouent aussi un rôle de premier plan dans le cadre de l'approche mise de l'avant à 
Merseyside.   Ainsi, les pharmaciens acceptent de remplir des ordonnances pour la préparation de 
cigarettes imbibées de stupéfiants, surnommée «reefers», qui offrent une alternative acceptable à ceux et 
celles qui sont à la recherche de cette «sensation» particulière que leur offre certaines drogues injectables.  
Pour préparer les «reefers», le pharmacien injecte de l'héroïne ou du méthadone dans des cigarettes 
ordinaires ou aux herbes naturelles.  Plusieurs clients qui reçoivent des drogues injectables par voie 
d'ordonnance depuis plus de 10 ans se tournent de plus en plus vers les «reefers» pour cesser de s'injecter.  
À part les «reefers», les pharmaciens distribuent des drogues sous la forme d'ampoules, de liquide ou 
d'aérosols. <P>
À la fin de juin 1991, la région de Mersey avait le plus bas taux de séropositivité chez les utilisateurs de 
drogues injectables des 14 régions d'Angleterre, c'est-à-dire un taux de huit cas par million, 
comparativement à 34 cas par million, pour l'Angleterre, et de 136 cas par million pour la région de 
North-West Thames;  le taux pour le Royaume-Uni s'établissait à51 cas par million.  En Écosse, le taux de 
séropositivité chez les utilisateurs de drogues injectables atteignait 183 cas par million.  Le programme de 
Mersey a aussi permis de réduire le taux de criminalité;  la sûreté de Merseyside a été le seul corps 
policier du Royaume-Uni à enregistrer, en 1990 et 1991, une baisse du taux de criminalité.<P>
<P>
<H2>La prévention des problèmes 
d'alcool</H2>
Depuis quelque temps déjà, on perçoit une tendance vers l'application de l'approche de réduction des 
méfaits aux problèmes liés à l'alcool.  Au cours des deux dernières décennies, les autorités ont surtout 
cherché à contrôler les problèmes associés à l'alcool par l'adoption de mesures de réglementation visant à 
restreindre l'accessibilité de ce produit. Cette approche repose sur le fait que l'ampleur des problèmes 
d'alcool à l'intérieur d'une collectivité est souvent liée au niveau total de consommation au sein de celle-ci. 
Récemment, les efforts de prévention ont porté beaucoup moins sur le contrôle de la consommation, mais 
davantage sur la réduction des méfaits qui en découlent.<P>
Cette nouvelle approche est fondée, notamment, sur l'accumulation de données empiriques qui révèlent 
que la réduction de l'accessibilité de l'alcool n'est pas une mesure très efficace étant donné que l'alcool est 
un produit très largement disponible.  De plus, on accorde dans bien des milieux de moins en moins de 
crédibilité à la théorie «Ledermann» de répartition de la consommation d'alcool, selon laquelle les 
problèmes engendrés par la consommation abusive d'alcool seraient beaucoup moins sérieux si tous les 
buveurs --même les buveurs modérés -- buvaient moins.  S'il est vrai qu'il existe dans toutes les sociétés 
une relation entre les niveaux moyens de consommation et l'incidence des problèmes liés à l'alcool, il 
existe néanmoins des exceptions importantes et plusieurs chercheurs contestent la validité de la théorie 
«Ledermann» de répartition de la consommation d'alcool. <P>
Un autre facteur est liés au fait qu'il existe de plus en plus d'indices voulant que la consommation 
régulière de petites quantités d'alcool ait un effet de protection contre les maladies coronariennes.  
Toutefois, on ne connaît pas encore très bien les effets de cette pratique sur les taux de mortalité de toutes 
causes.  Il se peut en effet que l'augmentation des risques découlant de certaines conséquences sur la santé 
viennent annuler les effets bénéfiques associés à l'usage régulier de petites quantités d'alcool.  De plus, 
certains groupes de personnes, notamment les jeunes, sont particulièrement vulnérables aux effets nocifs 
de l'alcool, même lorsque les doses sont négligeables.  <P>
Les effets bénéfiques susceptibles de découler d'une consommation modérée d'alcool, aussi faibles soient-
ils, remettent en question la parution, sur les contenants d'alcool, de messages de nature générale sur la 
santé et les raisons qui militent en faveur de mesures de restrictions vis-à-vis l'accessibilité de ce produit.  
Toutefois, les avertissements qui portent spécifiquement sur les effets néfastes de l'alcool sur la santé, tels 
que l'empoisonnement par l'alcool, demeurent pleinement justifiés.  Parmi les autres mesures de 
prévention appropriées, mentionnons l'uniformisation des équivalences de consommation, les mesures 
fiscales visant à promouvoir la consommation de substances à faible teneur en alcool et les programmes 
destinés àdiminuer les occasions de boire de façon abusive.  Les programmes de formation àl'intention des 
serveurs se sont aussi révélés très efficaces pour réduire les risques liés àl'usage abusif d'alcool.<P>
Une nouvelle approche de prévention se dessine en vertu de laquelle on fait davantage porter les efforts 
sur la diminution des occasions de consommation abusive plutôt que sur le niveau global d'alcool 
consommé.  Cette approche fait appel à des contrôles environnementaux, tels que l'intervention des 
serveurs et autres mesures de prévention destinées à convaincre les buveurs, peu importe leur niveau de 
consommation, d'éviter de boire jusqu'à l'intoxication et, partant, de minimiser les méfaits qui peuvent  
résulter de l'usage d'alcool. Le bien-fondé de l'approche de réduction des méfaits liés à l'usage de l'alcool 
repose sur l'analyse des données de l'Enquête sur l'alcool et les autres toxicomanies de 1989.  Le Centre 
canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies a conclu, quant à lui, que les occasions de boire 
de façon abusive donnent lieu à plus de problèmes que le niveau de consommation, proprement dit.  En 
effet, le risque de faire face à un problème d'alcool est plus grand chez un buveur modéré qui s'adonne, à 
l'occcasion, à une consommation abusive que chez un gros buveur qui boit rarement ou jamais de façon 
immodérée. <P>
Cette constatation est vraisemblablement liée à la tolérance physique et à la capacité des gros buveurs de 
développer des appuis dans son entourage et autres mécanismes capables de minimiser les répercussions 
indésirables de l'alcool.  À plus long terme, toutefois, la consommation abusive d'alcool fait croître les 
risques de maladies chroniques, tels que la cyrrhose du foie.  Tout compte fait, pour la plupart des 
problèmes aiguës, tels que la conduite en état d'ébriété, les troubles familiaux liés à l'alcool ou les 
difficultés en milieu de travail, ce sont surtout les consommateurs modérés qui contribuent à 
l'augmentation du nombre de ceux-ci.<P>
Les avantages susceptibles de découler d'un usage modéré d'alcool alliés aux constatations d'études 
récentes, selon lesquelles les occasions de boire abusivement sont en grande partie responsables des 
problèmes d'alcool, ont donné plus de proéminence àl'approche de prévention des méfaits liés à l'alcool.  
Cette nouvelle approche met l'emphase sur les occasions de boire de façon abusive et les conséquences 
néfastes de l'alcool plutôt que sur la consommation.  Ainsi donc, les mesures de prévention accordent plus 
d'importance à la nécessité de changer l'attitude de la population vis-à-vis l'intoxication par l'alcool et les 
comportements de personnes ivres plutôt que de chercher à convaincre les consommateurs modérés à boire 
moins ou à s'abstenir.<P>
<P>
<H3>Programmes de consommation modérée</H3>
Un des moyens de réduire les méfaits liés à l'alcool est d'apprendre aux gens de consommer modérément 
et intelligemment.  Martha Sanchez-Craig de la Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie de l'Ontario 
a mis au point un programme de ce type et elle a valider celui-ci auprès de plusieurs groupes de personnes 
sur une longue période d'années. Le programme s'adresse au buveurs d'accoutumance qui, en plus 
d'éprouver des problèmes de santé et de relations interpersonnelles, ont des difficultés au travail ou 
conduisent en état d'ébriété; ces personnes, pour la plupart, ne perçoivent pas la gravité de leur 
accoutumance à l'alcool et la nécessité de recevoir un traitement traditionnel axé sur l'abstinence.  <P>
Le programme de consommation modérée propose plusieurs étapes pour en arriver àboire modérément : 
<P>
1. <B>Surveiller les progrès :</B> de la même façon que les gens qui essaient de perdre du poids 
utilisent un pèse-personne, les buveurs doivent disposer d'un moyen pour mesurer leurs progrès.  Ainsi, 
les patients sont tenus d'inscrire quotidiennement les quantités d'alcool qu'ils consomment et indiquer 
comment ils ont évité de boire de façon abusive.<P>
2. <B>Ralentir le rythme de consommation :</B> les participants sont invités à mesurer leurs 
consommations, à diluer celles-ci, à boire plus lentement, à alterner boissons alcooliques avec les boissons 
non alcoolisées, à manger légèrement en buvant et à n'absorber qu'une consommation à chaque heure.<P>
3. <B>S'adonner à d'autres tâches :</B> on enseigne aux participants à occuper le temps normalement 
consacré à boire pour s'adonner à d'autres tâches comme marcher, visionner un film, lire ou développer 
leurs habiletés.<P>
4. <B>Demeurer aux aguets :</B>  puisqu'il y aura des moments où la tentation sera forte, on prodigue 
aux clients des conseils utiles et on leur indique comment s'autosuggestionner par des phrases comme «je 
n'ai pas l'intention d'abandonner mes efforts», refuser de boire sans avoir l'air antisociable ou tout 
simplement de quitter les lieux si la pression est trop élevée.<P>
5. <B>Ne pas recourir à de l'alcool quoiqu'il arrive :</B> les participants apprennent que l'alcool ne 
vient qu'empirer leur situation et que s'ils abusent de celle-ci c'est parce qu'ils veulent se valoriser ou poser 
des gestes jugés habituellement comme insurmontables.<P>
Le programme de consommation modérée aussi connu sous le nom de «Drink Wise» s'est révélé très 
efficace en tant que moyen rapide de traitement en externe, à peu de frais, pour réduire les méfaits liés à 
l'alcool.  Parmi les méfaits que l'on réussit à atténuer par cette approche, on trouve des problèmes sociaux 
et des désordres mentaux et physiques.<P>
<P>
<H3>Information sur les équivalences de 
consommation</H3>
Un autre moyen de réduire les méfaits liés aux drogues consiste à fournir aux consommateurs des 
renseignements factuels susceptibles de les aider à mieux contrôler leur consommation.  L'information sur 
les «équivalence de consommation» permet justement d'identifier le volume d'éthyle d'alcool paraissant 
sur le contenant par rapport au volume que renferme normalement une consommation.  D'ordinaire, la 
quantité servie correspond à la quantité d'alcool dans une bière, à teneur normale d'alcool, ou dans un 
verre de vin ou de spiritueux.<P>
Il a été démontré que la diffusion d'information sur les équivalences de consommation permet aux 
consommateurs et aux serveurs d'éviter l'intoxication et aux conducteurs de mieux évaluer si leur taux 
d'alcoolémie dépasse la norme légale; les équivalences aident aussi les personnes qui désirent maintenir 
leur niveau de consommation sous le niveau de «risques faibles» établi par les spécialistes de la santé.<P>
On ne dispose à l'heure actuelle que très peu de données sur la nécessité et les répercussions qui se 
dégagent de la diffusion d'information aux consommateurs sur les équivalences de consommation.  En 
Australie, Tim Stockwell et ses collègues ont établi que, dans l'ensemble, ces derniers sont incapables de 
juger avec précision la quantité d'alcool qu'ils ont consommée et qu'ils étaient favorables à la diffusion de 
ce type d'information.  En Australie, des normes d'équivalence existent depuis un certain temps.  Des 
équivalences de consommation sont aussi diffusées, sur une base volontaire, par les producteurs de vins 
d'Australie et par une chaîne d'épicerie du Royaume-Uni.<P>
Au Canada, l'Association canadienne des distillateurs a confié à la firme Decima Research le soin 
d'examiner les problèmes ayant trait à la diffusion d'équivalences de consommation.  La recherche menée 
auprès de quatre groupes-échantillons portait sur plusieurs questions.  Voici les points saillants :<P>
<UL>
<LI>Les personnes interrogées se sont prononcés majoritairement en faveur de la diffusion de 
renseignements relativement à la teneur en alcool des différentes boissons.  Il existe passablement de 
confusion entourant l'expression «pourcentage d'alcool par volume».
<LI>Les sujets, tous des adultes, ont souligné qu'une meilleure information sur les équivalences de 
consommation serait particulièrement utile aux jeunes qui commencent àconsommer de l'alcool.
<LI>Les consommateurs appuient généralement les mesures prises par l'entreprise privée pour prôner la 
modération et les jugent efficaces. 
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Programme à l'intention des serveurs</H3>
Un moyen de réduire les méfaits qu'engendre la consommation abusive d'alcool est d'amener les serveurs à 
reconnaître les signes d'ébriété chez leurs clients et d'éviter que ces derniers s'ennivrent.  Un programme à 
l'intention des serveurs a été élaboré par la Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie et endossé par la 
Commission des permis de vente d'alcool de l'Ontario (LLBO).  D'ailleurs, la Commission a mis au point 
un atelier un atelier d'une demi journée à l'intention des nouveau détenteurs de permis et serverus des 
établissements licenciés à subir une formation. La Colombie-Britannique possède déjà un programme 
obligatoire à l'intention des serveurs.<P>
Les serveurs doivent assister à un atelier de courte durée tandis que les propriétaires et les gérants 
d'établissement sont soumis à une séance d'information beaucoup plus longue.  On y traite des 
responsabilités légales, des effets de l'alcool, des facteurs qui influent sur le taux d'intoxication, comment 
reconnaître et prévenir l'intoxication et les moyens à prendre pour contrôler un client en train de 
s'ennivrer.  Il est important que la direction de l'établissement appuie le programme et qu'elle adopte une 
politique prônant la modération.<P>
<P>
<H3>Autres mesures</H3>
L'un des aspects les plus intéressants et les plus inusités dans l'application du concept de réduction des 
méfaits consiste à rendre l'alcool plus accessible aux alcooliques.  Une telle mesure a été appliquée, en 
juillet 1991, par la Régie des alcools de l'Alberta (ALCB) à Edmonton afin de diminuer la consommation 
de substances alcoolisées comme les nettoyeurs domestiques et les fixatifs pour cheveux.  Des intervenants 
de la santé et des services sociaux avaient observé que les itinérants du centre-ville faisaient usage de ces 
substances potentiellement mortelles parce que celles-ci étaient disponibles dans les dépanneurs du coin à 
une heure où les magasins de boissons alcoolisées n'étaient pas encore ouverts.  La Régie a convenu 
d'ouvrir, à titre d'essai, l'une de ses succursales du centre-ville deux heures et demie plus tôt.  L'expérience 
s'est révélée un succès et elle s'est poursuivie.  En avril 1993, la Régie des alcools du Manitoba a procédé 
au lancement d'une initiative similaire dans le centre-ville de Winnipeg.  Certains états américains 
prétendent même avoir éliminé complètement la consommation de solvants en procédant à la vente 
d'alcool à bon marché aux buveurs invétérés.<P>
<P>
<H2>L'éducation et la promotion de la 
santé</H2>
Le concept de réduction des méfaits repose sur le fait que les décideurs, les éducateurs et les intervenants 
en prévention peuvent expliquer aux toxicomanes pourquoi et comment ils doivent prévenir les méfaits et 
fournir à ces derniers les moyens appropriés, mais, en définitive, eux seuls sont capables de les éviter.  La 
recherche a clairement démontré que les utilisateurs réussissent à changer leurs comportements si on leur 
transmet de l'information sur l'usage sécuritaire des drogues, mais que ces changements sont plus 
accentués dans la mesure où ils reçoivent de la formation et qu'ils disposent des moyens pour y 
parvenir.<P>
Au cours des années 80 et encore de nos jours aux États-Unis, le moyen utilisé, dans bien des pays, pour 
contrer l'usage des drogues parmi les jeunes consistait à élaborer des programmes d'éducation en milieu 
scolaire ou par la voie des médias en s'inspirant du concept de prévention primaire («Dites NON à la 
drogue).  Cette approche présente généralement de l'information visant à illustrer les effets néfastes des 
drogues.  Plusieurs ont critiqué cette approche qui, très souvent, a tendance à exagérer les dangers et à 
perpétuer certains stéréotypes.  De plus, l'approche «Dites NON à la drogue» prend pour acquis, àmoins 
de preuve du contraire, que la décision de l'adolescent de tourner le dos à la drogue est plus facile lorsque 
ce dernier est informé des conséquences.  Dans la réalité, les évaluations menées sur les techniques de 
prévention primaire ont révélé que cette approche n'exerçait que peu d'influence sur la décision des jeunes 
de s'adonner ou non à la drogue. En effet, certaines études laissent à entendre qu'un recours exagéré à la 
prévention primaire peu encourager l'usage de drogues en créant alentour de celles-ci une mystique qui 
vient piquer la curiosité du jeune. <P>
La prévention primaire renforce la perception selon laquelle la consommation de drogue est un geste 
anormal et que les usagers sont des personnes déficientes sur le plan des connaissances, de l'estime de soi 
et des habiletés.  Toutefois, des études démontrent que ce sont précisément les personnes qui ont une haute 
estime de soi qui sont les plus susceptibles d'expérimenter avec les drogues.  De plus, des recherches 
soulignent que l'expérimentation est un moyen extrêmement inefficace de prédire l'utilisation ou l'abus 
àlong terme des drogues.  Plus encore, les techniques de prévention primaire font abstraction du plaisir et 
des bienfaits qui découlent de l'utilisation des drogues et omettent de reconnaître que la décision de 
consommer des drogues reflète souvent un désir de s'affirmer de la part de l'adolescent.   «L'amplification 
de la déviation» creuse un écart entre utilisateurs et non utilisateurs et empêche l'émergence d'un dialogue 
fructueux avec les adultes.  Bref, cette approche ne diminue en rien les méfaits pas plus qu'elle n'augmente 
la dimension sécuritaire.<P>
Les programmes de sensibilisation axée sur la réduction des méfaits mettent l'accent sur l'afflux d'une 
information objective sur les diverses drogues ainsi que sur leurs propriétés et leurs effets; les jeunes 
doivent aussi être informés des lois sur les drogues et de leurs droits et comment ils peuvent s'y prendre 
pour réduire les méfaits et obtenir de l'aide, s'il y a lieu. Cette approche permet aux jeunes de développer 
leurs capacités décisionnelles, de jugement, de communication, d'affirmation de soi, de résolution de 
conflits en plus d'apprendre l'usage sécuritaire des drogues.<P>
Certains pays ont commencé à appliquer les principes de réduction des méfaits dans le cadre de leurs 
programmes d'éducation sur les drogues.  Par exemple, au Royaume-Uni, on est à mettre au point un 
modèle de réduction des méfaits applicable aux activités d'éducation et de prévention.  Le modèle s'inspire 
de la réalité qui entoure l'utilisation des drogues chez les adolescents et ses buts sont à la fois réalistes et 
facilement applicables. Les activités d'éducation portent avant tout sur la drogue et non contre cette 
dernière.  À bas âge, on fait porter l'enseignement sur des substances familières, autres que la drogue, et 
on souligne à l'enfant que la plupart des choses qu'il consomme peuvent avoir des effets bénéfiques ou 
néfastes, selon la manière de les utiliser. <P>
L'éducation sur la réduction des méfaits est fondée sur une approche humaniste, pragmatique, 
d'inspiration scientifique et elle tient compte de la santé publique.  Ce type d'éducation met de l'avant un 
certain nombre de principes, dont voici les principaux : l'utilisation des drogues est normale; elle 
comporte des avantages et des risques; ce type d'abus ne peut être éliminé totalement mais ses effets 
peuvent être atténuer; bon nombre de jeunes réussissent à se départir de cette habitude; l'éducation ne doit 
pas reposer sur des énoncés subjectifs; il faut entretenir le dialogue avec les jeunes et respecter le choix des 
personnes à prendre leurs propres décisions; et, aussi, accentuer l'aspect positif des relations entre les pairs 
et éviter la polarisation des opinions.  <P>
<P>
<H2>Approches diverses relatives à 
l'application des lois</H2>
<H3>Approche axée sur la solution de problèmes à 
Montréal</H3>
Un projet pilote mis de l'avant par la police de la Communauté urbaine de Montréal (CUM) pour venir en 
aide à un quartier de Montréal, qui était aux prises avec des crimes liés aux drogues, a réussi à atteindre 
un équilibre entre la suppression de l'approvisionnement et la réduction de la demande.  Le projet en 
question, situé dans le quartier du Parc extension, utilise une approche très ferme à l'endroit des 
trafiquants tout en invitant les personnes trouvées en possession de petites quantités de drogues à subir un 
traitement, plutôt que de les traduire en justice.<P>
Le «Parc Ex» faisait l'objet de délits de toute sorte, y compris des problèmes liés au trafic de la drogue et à 
la délinquance,  avant que la police de la CUM ne lance son projet en avril 1992.  Un sondage mené dans 
le quartier indiquait alors que les citoyens étaient paralysés par la peur et que l'escalade des taux de 
criminalité était inévitable.  Une équipe spéciale d'agents formés à l'approche communautaire (Problem-
solving policing) a été affectée à temps plein pour renverser la spirale de la criminalité et apporter aux 
résidents une plus grande sécurité personnelle. <P>
Les policiers visitèrent les centres de traitement des environs pour développer une meilleure 
compréhension des divers modes d'intervention et pour rencontrer des toxicomanes en voie de 
réadaptation -- le quartier a un pourcentage fort élevé d'héroïnomanes.  Les policiers s'efforcèrent aussi 
d'offrir de l'aide aux utilisateurs plutôt que de procéder à leur arrestation pour possession.  Enfin, des 
ententes furent conclues avec les centres de désintoxication et de traitement pour qu'ils accueillent les 
personnes référées par les autorités policières.<P>
Selon les évaluations menées au cours de l'année qu'a duré le projet pilote, celui-ci atteint un tel niveau de 
succès qu'il a été convenu de poursuivre le programme du Parc extension, voire même de l'étendre à 
d'autres quartiers.<P>
<P>
<H3>Avertissements servis aux toxicomanes à 
Merseyside</H3>
La sûreté de Merseyside est reconnue, en Grande-Bretagne, comme étant à l'avant-garde, notamment en 
raison des efforts qu'elle a menés, de concert avec les autorités régionales de la santé, pour mettre au point 
une stratégie de réduction des méfaits et pour rehausser la prévention et le traitement des toxicomanes, 
plus particulièrement en ce qui a trait à la propagation du VIH chez les utilisateurs de drogues injectables.  
En plus d'être représentée sur les comités consultatifs sur les drogues, la sûreté a recours à des 
intervenants de l'organisme régional de santé pour dispenser des ateliers de formation àl'intention de ses 
policiers sur l'usage des drogues et ses conséquences sur la propagation du VIH.  La sûreté de Merseyside 
a aussi accepté de ne pas exercer de surveillance auprès des centres de traitement, de référer les 
contrevenants aux services de toxicomanies, de ne pas intenter de poursuites contre les détenteurs de 
seringues échangées et d'accorder publiquement son appui au programme d'échange de seringues.<P>
L'une des caractéristiques de la stratégie mise au point par le service de police de Merseyside est de 
concentrer ses efforts à la lutte contre les trafiquants et d'adopter un approche plus conciliante envers les 
utilisateurs.  Cette approche consiste à amener l'utilisateur au poste de police, de confisquer la drogue en 
sa possession, d'enregistrer l'incident et d'avertir officiellement le prévenu que la prochaine fois qu'il sera 
trouvé en possession de drogues illégales, il sera traduit devant les tribunaux.  Le prévenu doit aussi 
remplir d'autres conditions, notamment de ne pas avoir été condamné antérieurement pour ce type 
d'infraction et ne pas avoir un dossier criminel lourd.  On remet enfin à ce dernier de l'information sur les 
services de traitement disponibles dans la région et on lui fait part des programmes d'échange de 
seringues.<P>
La première fois que la personne est arrêtée, elle ne possède pas un dossier criminel. Par contre, la 
deuxième et la troisième fois, elle comparaît devant la cour pour lui imposer une amende pour possession 
de petites quantités de drogue ou recevoir une sentence si elle est trouvée en possession de quantités plus 
grandes.  Une fois qu'un toxicomane est enregistré auprès d'une agence de service autorisée, il peut alors 
posséder de la drogue pour ses propres fins.  Le but recherché par cette approche est de détourner les 
toxicomanes du crime et de leur éviter des peines d'emprisonnement.<P>
<P>
<H2>L'avenir</H2>
Le modèle de la réduction des méfaits a suscité beaucoup d'intérêt au cours des dernières années partout 
dans le monde, par suite de la tenue, en 1990, à Liverpool, Angleterre, de la Conférence internationale sur 
la réduction des méfaits liés aux drogues. Lors de la 4e Conférence internationale qui a eu lieu à 
Rotterdam en mars 1993, le représentant de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé, le Dr Marcus Grant, est 
venu confirmer que l'approche de réduction des méfaits était passée du stade de «l'acceptabilité» à celui de 
la «crédibilité».  La décision de tenir, en mars 1994, la prochaine conférence internationale en Amérique 
du Nord vient confirmer à quel point ce concept a acquis de la crédibilité.<P>
Le concept de réduction des méfaits est un moyen humain, peu coûteux, efficace et pratique de traiter les 
problèmes liés à la drogue.  Cependant, il reste beaucoup à accomplir pour étendre son application à tous 
les pays.  Plusieurs obstacles se dressent.  Dans son allocution, le Dr Grant a souligné que «la réduction 
des méfaits devrait s'appliquer àl'ensemble des pays, non seulement aux pays riches».  L'un des défis 
consiste à appliquer ce concept aux pays en développement.  Selon le Dr Grant, la population en a assez 
de la question des drogues, ce qui explique pourquoi elle ne peut qu'entrevoir des solutions extrêmes 
comme la prohibition et la légalisation à outrance.  Si ces deux scénarios sont trop éloignés les uns des 
autres, la réduction des méfaits, elle, se présente comme une mesure mitoyenne.  <P>
Un autre obstacle à l'endossement de ce modèle dans bien des pays tient à la perception étroite que l'on 
entretient à l'égard du concept de l'idéalisme.  La réduction des méfaits accepte le principe que certains 
méfaits sont inévitables tandis que le concept de «tolérance zéro» exclut toute forme de compromis et 
établit des buts impossibles à atteindre. En Amérique du Nord, l'abstinence totale a longtemps été perçue 
comme la seule forme acceptable de traitement pour les personnes qui abusent des drogues licites et 
comme le seul état normal en ce qui a trait aux drogues illicites.  L'approche de réduction des méfaits 
présente d'autres choix, sans pour autant exclure l'abstinence.<P>
La réticence de la population de percevoir les drogues comme une forme légitime de risque pose un autre 
obstacle de taille à l'acceptation de la théorie de réduction des méfaits. S'il est vrai que la société tolère, 
voire même encourage, des risques susceptibles de créer des torts beaucoup plus sérieux, tels que les 
courses d'automobiles, la boxe, l'escalade en montagne et le «bungee jumping», il n'en demeure pas moins 
que l'usage des drogues est généralement perçu comme une pratique foncièrement diabolique.  Parce que 
la réduction des méfaits accepte la possibilité de consommer des drogues dans certaines circonstances, 
d'aucuns jugent cette approche comme un encouragement à l'adoption de comportements non acceptables. 
<P>
L'opposition religieuse, l'apathie du public et la confusion qui entoure les politiques sur les drogues de 
même que l'incapacité des pays de modifier leurs propres politiques sociales, en raison des ententes sur le 
commerce international et autres mesures semblables, sont autant d'obstacles qui nuisent à l'application du 
concept de réduction des méfaits. Étant donné que ce concept se situe à mi-chemin entre deux extrêmes, la 
réduction des méfaits demeure un concept difficile à définir et à promouvoir.  Celui-ci soulève nombre de 
questions :  qui décide, en effet, ce qui constitue un méfait et jusqu'où devons-nous aller pour réduire 
ceux-ci?  La prescription de drogues injectables, par exemple, peut réduire les risques d'infection par le 
VIH et la criminalité, mais d'autres avancent qu'une telle mesure est susceptible de prolonger le recours à 
cette pratique. Or, dans un tel contexte, quelle action est la plus désirable et à qui celle-ci profitera-t-elle 
?<P>
De toute évidence, le concept de réduction des méfaits ne saurait apporter des réponses nettes et claires 
aux problèmes de la drogue, mais, s'il est bien appliqué, il peut apporter des remèdes à un problème très 
sérieux sans compromettre la qualité et l'intégrité de la vie humaine dans toute sa richesse et sa 
complexité.  Ce concept sous-tend la Stratégie canadienne antidrogue et c'est un moyen à la fois pratique 
et réaliste susceptible de servir de modèle à l'établissement au Canada d'une politique sur les drogues.  
Pour y arriver, il nous faut définir plus clairement l'approche de réduction des méfaits et examiner 
attentivement ses répercussions.  Tout compte fait, cette approche devrait se révéler non seulement comme 
le prolongement de notre esprit humanitaire, mais aussi comme le reflet de celui-ci.<P>

<H3>Document de travail sur la politique du Centre 
canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies.  
Rédigé par le Groupe National de travail sur la politique du 
CCLAT.</H3>
Ce document de travail sur la politique a été rédigé par le Groupe national de travail sur la 
politique du CCLAT, lequel est formé de Peter Conley, David Hewitt, Wayne Mitic, Christiane 
Poulin, Diane Riley, Robin Room, Ed Sawka, Eric Single (président) et John Topp.  Les idées 
exprimées dans le présent document ne reflètent pas nécessairement celles des organismes 
auxquels les membres du Groupe national de travail appartiennent.  On peut se procurer une 
version plus complète et avec bibliographie de ce document auprès du CCLAT à Ottawa.<P>
<HR>
<H2>A.  Historique</H2>
<H3>1.  Contexte</H3>
L'élaboration de politiques sur l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies trouve utilement sa place dans un 
cadre de promotion de la santé.  Conformément à ce cadre, un objectif central de la politique 
de la santé est de promouvoir et de protéger la santé publique.  On peut réaliser ces objectifs en 
adoptant des stratégies visant au maintien et au renforcement de la santé, à l'évitement des 
risques et à la réduction des méfaits.  Les stratégies et politiques de promotion de la santé et de 
réduction des méfaits doivent s'attaquer à l'ensemble des risques d'aggravation des problèmes 
de toxicomanie et elles s'avèrent plus efficaces si les groupes et organismes concernés 
participent à leur élaboration.<P>
Conformément au concept de réduction des méfaits, les principaux objectifs d'une politique en 
matière de drogue devraient être d'atténuer les conséquences négatives de la toxicomanie.  La 
réduction des méfaits a pour but de réduire les problèmes de santé et les problèmes sociaux liés 
à la drogue chez les individus, les familles et les collectivités.  Les stratégies de réduction des 
méfaits sont fondées sur une hiérarchie d'objectifs oú les buts immédiats et réalisables ont la 
priorité.  L'approche adoptée peut inclure ou non l'abstinence comme but.<P>
Dans un cadre de promotion de la santé et de réduction des méfaits, le ralentissement de la 
propagation du virus de l'immunodéficience humaine chez les utilisateurs de drogues injectables 
est une question prioritaire.  Dans de nombreux pays, des organismes ont adopté la position 
selon laquelle tous les efforts possibles doivent être déployés pour prévenir la propagation du 
VIH par et parmi les utilisateurs de drogues injectables eux, cette position veut également que 
les politiques en matière de drogues ne compromettent pas ces efforts.<P>
L'utilisation de drogues injectables est un facteur de risque principal pour la transmission du 
virus de l'immunodéficience humaine (VIH) et, par conséquent, l'un des principaux facteurs de 
l'incidence du syndrome d'immunodéficience acquise (SIDA).  Au Canada, l'utilisation de 
drogues injectables est, après l'activité homosexuelle et (ou) bisexuelle, le second moyen de 
transmission du VIH chez les hommes et le second, également chez les femmes après les 
relations hétérosexuelles.  La transmission s'effectue par transfert de sang d'une personne à 
l'autre lors du partage de seringues non nettoyées.<P>
Au Canada, environ 100 000 utilisateurs de drogues injectables sont désormais exposés à 
l'infection par le VIH.  La plupart de ces personnes se retrouvent dans les régions 
métropolitaines de Montréal, Toronto et Vancouver, mais il existe des utilisateurs de drogues 
injectables dans la plupart des régions rurales et urbaines du Canada.<P>
Traditionnellement, l'héroïne a été la principale drogue administrée par injection au Canada; le 
Talwin et le Ritalin ont également été des drogues injectables populaires à divers moments dans 
différentes régions du pays.  Au cours des dernières années, la cocaïne a été utilisée de façon 
croissante par les utilisateurs de drogues injectables, soit isolément, soit en combinaison avec de 
l'héroïne.  L'utilisation non médicale de stéroïdes anabolisants par les athlètes, les danseurs et la 
population masculine en général tend également à croître partout au Canada.  Dans de tels cas, 
les stéroïdes sont utilisés afin d'accroître la force et d'améliorer l'apparence, en dépit du risque 
d'effets secondaires.<P>
Le risque d'infection par le VIH ne se limite pas aux utilisateurs de drogues injectables mais il 
existe aussi pour les partenaires sexuels; au moins 40 % des utilisateurs de drogues injectables 
entretiennent des relations avec des non-utilisateurs.  Comme l'infection par le VIH peut se 
propager des utilisateurs de drogues injectables à des partenaires sexuels et comme un tiers 
environ des utilisateurs de drogues injectables sont des femmes, il y a risque que des bébés 
soient infectés par transmission périnatale du virus.  La possibilité de transmission du virus aux 
membres de la communauté n'utilisant pas de drogues injectables est accrue du fait que certains 
utilisateurs de drogues injectables se prostituent contre de l'argent ou des drogues et, quoique 
des condoms soient souvent utilisés, ce n'est pas toujours le cas.<P>
La prévention de la propagation du VIH par et parmi les utilisateurs de drogues injectables est 
ainsi un élément clé de la réduction de l'incidence du SIDA.  Les mesures adoptées pour limiter 
la propagation du VIH permettront également d'empêcher la propagation d'autres infections, 
telles que l'hépatite, qui peut être transmise par le partage de matériel d'injection.<P>
<H3>2.  L'échange de seringues - Une stratégie de 
prévention</H3>
Il existe de nombreuses stratégies visant à limiter la propagation du VIH et d'autres infections 
par et parmi les utilisateurs de drogues injectables.  Citons notamment les trousses d'eau de 
javel, la provision de drogues fumables et le traitement d'entretien à la méthadone, etc.  Une 
approche ayant été adoptée en raison de sa simplicité et de son coût relativement bas est 
l'échange de seringues.  Comme l'eau de javel ne détruit pas les virus de l'hépatite et n'est pas 
toujours efficace pour détruire le VIH, la provision de seringues stériles est devenue l'approche 
par excellence pour veiller à ce que les utilisateurs de drogues injectables utilisent du matériel 
d'injection propre.  Cette approche représente en outre une façon d'entrer en contact avec les 
utilisateurs de drogues de même qu'un moyen économique de leur dispenser de l'éducation, des 
conseils et de leur permettre d'accéder à un traitement ainsi qu'à d'autres services.<P>
L'échange de seringues a commencé de façon officieuse au Canada en 1987; le premier 
échange officiel ayant eu lieu à Vancouver en mars 1989.  Les services étaient initialement 
dispensés dans des emplacements fixes et grâce à du dépistage dans les rues, de même que par 
une représentation limitée auprès d'autres organismes dispensant des services aux utilisateurs de 
drogues dans les zones du centre-ville.  Avec le temps, des fourgonnettes mobiles se sont 
ajoutées aux services de nombreuses villes.  Des trousses contenant des seringues, de l'eau de 
javel et des condoms sont distribuées par l'entremise de ces organismes.<P>
Entre 1989 et 1993, le gouvernement fédéral a partagé les dépenses de programmes pilotes de 
dépistage fondés sur un modèle de services polyvalents dans cinq provinces.  Depuis lors, on a 
assisté à une croissance rapide d'autres programmes de dépistage comprenant l'échange de 
seringues.  Des programmes sont actuellement en cours au Yukon, dans les Territoires du 
Nord-Ouest, à Calgary, Edmonton et Halifax de même que dans un certain nombre de 
collectivités du Québec, de la Colombie-Britannique et de l'Ontario.  Jusqu'à ce jour, plus de 
trente échanges de seringues existent dans des régions rurales et urbaines du Canada, alors que 
de nombreux autres sont en voie d'ouvrir.  En outre, il existe actuellement de nombreuses 
cliniques, pharmacies et autres établissements qui offrent des services d'échange de 
seringues.<P>
<H3>3.  L'échange de seringues - Est-ce efficace?</H3>
Grâce aux échanges de seringues, on parvient à atteindre un nombre élevé d'utilisateurs de 
drogues injectables, dont plusieurs sont en contact avec d'autres services et ont déjà reçu une 
certaine aide formelle relativement à leur problème de toxicomanie.  Des recherches effectuées 
partout dans le monde, notamment dans neuf endroits du Canada, témoignent de l'efficacité de 
l'échange de seringues.<P>
Il existe désormais des preuves directes selon lesquelles la disponibilité accrue de matériel 
d'injection propre freine la propagation du VIH, et il existe des preuves indirectes selon 
lesquelles l'accès limité à des approvisionnements d'aiguilles et de seringues l'accélère.  Ces 
deux formes de preuve montrent que l'accès à du matériel d'injection stérile et que des actions 
de dépistage accompagnées du développement d'une relation de confiance entre les 
responsables de la santé et les utilisateurs de drogues injectables sont cruciaux pour limiter la 
propagation de l'infection par le VIH.<P>
De nombreuses études ont montré que la majorité des utilisateurs de drogues injectables 
modifieront leur comportement afin de réduire le risque d'infection par le VIH et qu'ils sont très 
motivés à chercher de l'aide afin de modifier leur comportement.  Bien que certaines études 
aient montré que ceux qui ont participé à des échanges représentent eux-mêmes un groupe à 
risques plus élevés que ne le sont ceux qui n'y ont pas participé, il a été montré qu'un 
changement comportemental se produisait plus souvent chez ceux qui avaient participé à un 
échange de seringues que chez ceux qui n'y avaient pas participé.  Il n'existe aucune preuve d'un 
usage accru de drogues dans aucune des collectivités oú des échanges de seringues ont 
actuellement lieu.<P>
<H2>B.  QUESTIONS</H2>
<H3>1.  Philosophies discordantes</H3>
Les arguments en faveur et en défaveur des programmes d'échange de seringues sont 
partiellement fondés sur des présomptions différentes quant à la population utilisant des drogues 
injectables.  Les défenseurs des programmes d'échange de seringues prétendent que ceux-ci 
sont symboliquement importants comme moyen d'établir des liens entre la communauté utilisant 
des drogues et les organismes de services.  Ils font valoir que l'échange de seringues ne devrait 
pas être considéré comme une façon de fermer les yeux sur l'usage des drogues mais plutót 
comme un moyen de sensibiliser les utilisateurs.  Ces défenseurs évoquent l'argument selon 
lequel une proportion importante d'utilisateurs de drogues injectables souhaitent modifier leur 
comportement et sont effectivement en mesure de le faire, afin de réduire au minimum le risque 
d'infection par le VIH.  Ils ajoutent qu'un changement comportemental sera plus 
vraisemblablement maintenu si des messages et des services d'éducation appropriés et 
culturellement pertinents sont diffusés et offerts.  Ils soutiennent que les utilisateurs de drogues, 
même ceux qui ont une dépendance très forte à l'égard des drogues, ont une certaine maîtrise 
de leur comportement en ce qui a trait à l'usage de drogues.  Le degré élevé de participation 
aux programmes d'échange de seringues plaide en faveur de ce point de vue.  L'exigence selon 
laquelle les seringues doivent être échangés a pour effet de "débarrasser" les rues des seringues.  
D'autres mesures d'hygiène publique, notamment des récipients hygiéniques destinés à recueillir 
les aiguilles souillées et des programmes d'éducation, permettent de veiller à ce que les seringues 
utilisées comportent un risque minimal pour la santé.<P>
Les opposants à l'échange de seringues font valoir pour leur part que la distribution officielle e 
seringues aux utilisateurs de drogues injectables a pour effet de véhiculer un message 
inapproprié.  Ils prétendent que la distribution de seringues laisse croire que les fonctionnaires 
tolèrent l'usage de drogues illégales et que cela sous-entend qu'il est socialement acceptable.  
Ces opposants font valoir que la distribution de seringues entraînera une augmentation de l'usage 
des drogues.  Ils ajoutent également que l'approvisionnement de seringues aura pour 
conséquence que des seringues utilisées seront mises au rebut dans des endroits à la portée 
d'enfants qui risqueraient ainsi une infection par le VIH en se blessant avec des aiguilles.<P>
La position des organismes de santé publique en ce qui a trait à l'échange de seringues a depuis 
toujours été concrète et explicite.  Il est pertinent de mener des actions vigoureuses afin de 
réduire au minimum les méfaits immédiats, même si cette action pourrait comporter certains 
risques à long terme.  L'échange de seringues s'inscrit manifestement dans cette tradition.<P>
Au niveau politique, l'échange de seringues est une question souvent controversée en raison des 
préoccupations légales qu'elle soulève.  Au Canada, les obstacles juridiques, tels que ceux qui 
sont posés par les instruments pour l'utilisation de drogues illicites et d'autres lois en matière de 
drogues sont plus une question de perception qu'un véritable problème.  À titre d'exemple, en 
vertu de la législation actuelle les seringues propres sont à l'abri des accusations ayant trait aux 
instruments pour l'utilisation de drogues illicites.<P>
<H3>2.  Maximiser l'efficacité</H3>
Ce ne sont pas tous les utilisateurs de drogues qui profitent des programmes d'échange de 
seringues.  Par ailleurs, tous les programmes ne sont pas également efficaces pour réduire la 
propagation de l'infection par le VIH.  Voici certains des facteurs limitatifs :<P>
a)  Dans de nombreux pays, il existe des preuves selon lesquelles l'échange de seringues ne 
parviendrait pas à sensibiliser les femmes, les jeunes utilisateurs et les nouveaux utilisateurs.<P>
b)  La préoccupation qui est à l'origine de la provision de seringues a souvent fait en sorte 
qu'une attention insuffisante a été accordée à l'aide à apporter aux gens afin qu'ils modifient leur 
comportement en ce qui a trait à leurs pratiques sexuelles, à l'utilisation des drogues et au 
partage de seringues.<P>
c)  De nombreux utilisateurs de drogues se sentent gênés de participer à un échange pour la 
première fois ou d'accéder ultérieurement à d'autres services de soutien.<P>
Cependant, des études portant sur les échanges de seringues menées de par le monde suggèrent 
que bon nombre de facteurs décisifs peuvent en maximiser l'efficacité.  Il importe notamment 
:<P>
a)  Que le lieu de l'échange soit situé à proximité de l'endroit oú vivent les utilisateurs de drogues 
injectables et qu'il soit ouvert aux heures appropriées.<P>
b)  Que des ententes informelles soient conclues avec les autorités policières afin qu'elles 
adoptent une approche non conflictuelle à l'égard des clients.<P>
c)  Que les échanges soient menées en collaboration avec la collectivité locale et que des 
programmes de santé publique soient conjointement menés.<P>
d)  Que le personnel soit tolérant et à l'aise avec les utilisateurs de drogues injectables.<P>
e)  Que des renseignements appropriés et des conseils sur l'utilisation des drogues, les pratiques 
sexuelles et le VIH soient diffusés; en d'autres mots, qu'un ensemble de services soit offert aux 
utilisateurs.<P>
<H3>3.  Partenariats</H3>
Comme toute autre stratégie de promotion de la santé, les programmes de réduction des méfaits 
gagnent en efficacité s'il y a collaboration entre les divers groupes et organismes concernés.  Les 
responsables de l'application de la loi, les bureaux de santé publique, les organismes de lutte 
contre la toxicomanie, les groupes communautaires et les utilisateurs de drogues eux-mêmes 
sont les principaux intéressés qui doivent former des partenariats efficaces en vue de l'échange 
de seringues.  Leur collaboration est importante non seulement parce qu'il s'agit de former des 
partenariats réunissant des groupes nombreux et divers, mais également parce que leurs 
préoccupations doivent être entendues et que des mesures conséquentes doivent être 
prises.<P>
<H3>4.  Le róle des pharmacies</H3>
Les pharmaciens peuvent jouer un róle important dans la prévention de la propagation du VIH 
en vendant des aiguilles et des seringues propres aux utilisateurs de drogues.  Les pharmacies 
peuvent également servir de lieu d'élimination des aiguilles sales.  On trouve des pharmacies 
dans presque tous les quartiers et elles sont par conséquent accessibles à tous.  Les 
pharmaciens sont également en mesure de dispenser une éducation sur l'hygiène publique aux 
clients qui demandent des seringues en vérifiant s'il existe des problèmes quant aux pratiques 
d'injection, en discutant des possibilités de traitement de la toxicomanie et en faisant subir des 
tests VIH.<P>
En servant les utilisateurs de drogues injectables, les pharmaciens sont susceptibles de faire face 
à un certain nombre de problèmes : un risque accru de vols; la perte d'autres clients; ou une 
augmentation du nombre de seringues mises au rebut de façon non sécuritaire dans le quartier.  
Cependant, en restreignant le stock de seringues à la zone de distribution, en participant 
personnellement à chaque vente et en travaillant de concert avec d'autres programmes de santé 
publique et de services de traitement, le pharmacien peut réduire ces risques au minimum.<P>
Traditionnellement, les pharmaciens ont été réticents à vendre des seringues à des utilisateurs de 
drogues notoires ou soupçonnés et à mettre des seringues jetables à leur disposition.  
Cependant, plus récemment, un nombre croissant de pharmaciens ont réagi au problème du 
SIDA en vendant et des seringues sur demande.  Ce changement amorcé à la fin des années 80 
a eu lieu par suite de la recommandation de l'Association pharmaceutique canadienne visant à 
accroître la disponibilité des seringues.  Un certain nombre d'organismes provinciaux de 
réglementation ont depuis lors libéralisé leurs politiques à cet égard.<P>
<H2>C.  RECOMMANDATIONS MISES DE 
L'AVANT DANS LE CADRE DE CETTE 
POLITIQUE</H2>
1.  Les efforts visant à prévenir la propagation du VIH et d'autres infections par les utilisateurs 
de drogues injectables et entre eux devraient être considérés comme hautement prioritaires par 
les gouvernements et les organismes intéressés.<P>
2.  À titre d'éléments clés de la prévention de la propagation du VIH par les utilisateurs de 
drogues injectables, des programmes d'échange de seringues adaptés aux réalités culturelles et 
facilement accessibles doivent être mis sur pied partout oú un tel besoin existe au Canada.  On 
devrait également accorder toute l'attention nécessaire aux utilisateurs de stéroïdes et à d'autres 
groupes, tels que les diabétiques, qui ont éventuellement besoin d'obtenir des seringues 
gratuitement.<P>
3.  Les programmes d'échange de seringues devraient être considérés comme un seul élément 
d'une stratégie globale visant à réduire les méfaits parmi les utilisateurs de drogues injectables; 
une approche polyvalente de l'hygiène publique en ce qui a trait à l'utilisation de drogues 
injectables s'impose à la grandeur du pays.<P>
4.  On devrait favoriser un climat d'acceptation et de compréhension quant au róle des échanges 
de seringues dans la prévention du SIDA grâce à une collaboration accrue entre les autorités en 
matière de santé publique, les groupes communautaires, les responsables de l'application de la 
loi et les fonctionnaires du gouvernement, les organismes de réglementation et les 
pharmaciens.<P>
5.  On devrait multiplier les possibilités de mise au rebut sécuritaire des seringues utilisées dans 
toutes les collectivités à tous les niveaux et endroits pertinents en mettant en oeuvre des plans 
locaux globaux.<P>
6.  On devrait inciter les pharmaciens à vendre des seringues aux utilisateurs de drogues 
injectables.  Les pharmaciens devraient considérer les bienfaits hygiéniques de la vente de 
seringues et soupeser ces avantages sur le plan de l'hygiène publique par rapport aux risques 
que cela comporte pour la pharmacie elle-même.<P>
7.  On devrait encourager les fabricants et les distributeurs de seringues à créer des emballages 
qui comportent des avertissements relatifs à la propagation du SIDA et de l'hépatite ainsi que 
des instructions assorties de schémas concernant la mise au rebut sécuritaire de leurs 
produits.<P>
8.  En l'absence d'échange de seringues, l'eau de javel non diluée (bien que son effet soit limité) 
devrait être mise à la disposition des utilisateurs de drogues injectables de sorte qu'ils puissent 
réduire le risque d'infection à partir de matériel non stérile.<P>
9.  De plus amples recherches devraient être entreprises afin :<P>
a)  de déterminer l'efficacité des programmes d'échange de seringues;<P>
b)  de déterminer les moyens les plus efficaces de sensibiliser les utilisateurs de drogues 
injectables en particulier les jeunes, les femmes, les récents ou occasionnels utilisateurs;<P>
c)  de déterminer l'incidence de l'utilisation des drogues injectables ainsi que les caractéristiques 
des utilisateurs de drogues injectables, notamment les utilisateurs de stéroïdes;<P>
d)  de trouver des moyens efficaces de détruire le VIH et le virus de l'hépatite dans le matériel 
d'injection;<P>
e)  de trouver des méthodes efficaces de dissuader les individus de commencer à s'injecter des 
drogues et d'aider ceux qui s'adonnent déjà à ces pratiques à cesser de le faire;<P>
f)  d'améliorer les schémas de référence entre les différentes formes de services dispensés;<P>
g)  d'améliorer les pratiques de dépistage.<P>

<H1>LE SYNDROME D'ALCOOLISME 
FOETAL:<BR>
UN PROBLÈME DE SANTÉ INFANTILE 
ET FAMILIALE</H1>
<H4>Document de discussion de politique</H4>
<B>Groupe de travail national sur la politique du Centre canadien de lutte contre 
l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies (CCLAT)</B><P>
Ce document de discussion de politique a été préparé par le Groupe de travail sur la politique du CCLAT, 
composé de Peter Conley, David Hewitt, Wayne Mitic, Diane Riley, Robin Room, Ed Sawka, Eric Single 
(président) et John Topp.  Les points de vue exprimés dans ce document ne reflètent pas nécessairement 
ceux des organismes auxquels appartiennent les membres du Groupe de travail national.  Les membres du 
Groupe de travail remercient sincèrement les personnes qui ont pris le temps de faire des commentaires sur 
les premiers projets de document et qui ont partagé leurs connaissances.  Cet énoncé a été approuvé par le 
Conseil d'administration du CCLAT, le 19 septembre 1994.<P>
<HR>
<H3>A.  Historique</H3>
<H5>1.  Contexte</H5>
On a largement démontré les nombreux effets néfastes sur la santé qui sont liés à la 
consommation excessive de boissons alcoolisées.  Depuis quelque temps, on s'inquiète tout 
particulièrement des effets de la consommation d'alcool par la mère et le père sur le 
développement et l'état de santé général du foetus et de l'enfant.  Plusieurs études corroborent la 
conclusion selon laquelle la consommation excessive par la mère est un facteur indispensable et 
déterminant du «syndrome de l'alcoolisme foetal» (SAF).  Or, le fait qu'un enfant soit atteint du 
SAF semble dépendre de plusieurs facteurs qui s'ajoutent à l'alcool, notamment la santé des 
parents, la consommation d'autres drogues, le mode de vie et d'autres facteurs socio-économiques.  
Ainsi, le SAF ne peut et ne doit pas être considéré de façon isolée de la préoccupation générale 
pour la santé et le bien-être des enfants et de leur famille.<P>
<H5>2.  Syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal (SAF) - Définition</H5>
Le SAF est un ensemble d'anomalies présentes chez les enfants nés de femmes qui, pendant la 
grossesse, ont consommé des boissons alcoolisées en quantité relativement grande.  Le SAF ne 
peut être diagnostiqué que lorsqu'il y a des signes d'anomalies de chacune des catégories 
suivantes.  Ces critères ont été élaborés en fonction de nouveaux-nés et peuvent ne pas être 
appropriés pour d'autres groupes d'âge.<P>
a)  Retard de croissance (prénatale et (ou) postnatale)<P>
<UL>
<LI>poids ou grandeur inférieur au dixième centième lorsqu'on le corrige en fonction de l'âge gestationnel
</UL>
b)  Trouble du système nerveux central<P>
<UL>
<LI>anomalie neurologique (p. ex., troubles auditifs)
<LI>retard de développement
<LI>trouble du comportement ou déficience comportementale
<LI>détérioration mentale (p. ex., difficulté d'apprentissage, déficience mentale) et (ou) anomalies 
structurelles (p. ex., malformations cérébrales).
</UL>
c)  Particularités du visage<P>
<UL>
<LI>petites ouvertures des yeux (fentes palpébrales courtes)
<LI>partie moyenne du visage allongée et plate
<LI>lèvre supérieure mince
<LI>sillon sous-développé (philtrum) entre la lèvre supérieure et le nez.
</UL>
Outre l'ensemble des anomalies connues sous le nom de SAF, plusieurs traits particuliers, souvent 
appelés les effets de l'alcoolisme foetal (EAF), sont associés à la consommation de boissons 
alcoolisées pendant la grossesse.  Les EAF ne constituent pas nécessairement une forme moins 
grave de SAF puisque les signes - même s'ils sont moins nombreux - peuvent être aussi sévères 
que ceux du SAF.  En voici des exemples :<P>
<UL>
<LI>problèmes d'apprentissage (difficultés d'apprentissage et (ou) déficience mentale)
<LI>problèmes du comportement (dysfonctionnement moteur, déficit de la capacité d'attention, 
hyperactivité, trouble du sommeil)
<LI>troubles auditifs
<LI>malformations congénitales isolées
</UL>
Toutefois, jusqu'à maintenant, il n'existe aucune preuve universellement reconnue indiquant que les 
EAF représentent une entité définissable et il serait mal avisé d'appliquer ce diagnostic, en partie 
parce qu'on risque d'étiqueter les enfants à tort.  Chacun des symptômes peut être présent chez 
des enfants dont la mère n'a consommé aucune boisson alcoolisée pendant la grossesse.  Étant 
donné ces incertitudes, plusieurs autorités dans le domaine ont déconseillé l'emploi du terme EAF 
et préconisé une meilleure compréhension de chaque malformation congénitale liée à la 
consommation d'alcool.  Même si cette façon de procéder peut être justifiée, il y a de bonnes 
raisons de craindre que les effets éventuels de l'alcoolisme foetal soient exclus des critères de 
diagnostic du SAF.<P>
<H5>3.  Syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal (SAF) - Incidence</H5>
Lorsqu'on examine l'incidence du SAF, il ne faut surtout pas oublier que plusieurs facteurs peuvent 
influencer sur les estimations.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Il est difficile de le diagnostiquer.  Il faut posséder une expérience considérable pour reconnaître les 
traits du visage liés au syndrome.  Par ailleurs, certains de ces traits sont la norme dans différents groupes 
raciaux.
<LI>Il est difficile de mesurer avec exactitude la consommation de boissons alcoolisées à un moment donné 
et il est tout particulièrement difficile de la mesurer pendant la grossesse, période où la crainte des 
conséquences peut porter à ne pas déclarer une bonne partie de la consommation.  En outre, il n'existe 
aucun consensus sur la quantité, autre que la consommation très excessive (p. ex., cinq consommations ou 
plus par jour), ou sur le mode de consommation (p. ex., boire de façon irrégulière) qui cause des dommages.
<LI>Quelques traits du SAF peuvent être dus à diverses influences néfastes, ou être aggravés par elles 
(p. ex., mauvaise alimentation, violence familiale ou toxicomanie, autres problèmes obstétricaux et de santé 
de la mère), et interagir avec les boissons alcoolisées ingérées pendant la grossesse.
</UL>
En raison de ces facteurs, les estimations sur l'incidence du SAF sont très nombreuses et 
controversées.  Selon des données récentes, le taux dans le grand public est évalué à 0,33 cas sur 
1 000 naissances vivantes.  Cette estimation est prudente et n'englobe pas les groupes minoritaires 
tels les autochtones.  Les résultats d'études limitées donnent à penser que le taux dans les 
populations autochtones est au moins dix fois plus élevé.<P>
<H3>B.  Problèmes</H3>
<H5>1.  Dommages non intentionnels</H5>
Les preuves dont on dispose actuellement corroborent la conclusion selon laquelle les femmes qui 
boivent beaucoup pendant la grossesse peuvent avoir des enfants présentant les traits du SAF.  
Étant donné les dommages éventuels causés au foetus, certains professionnels de la santé 
conseillent aux femmes enceintes de s'abstenir.  Toutefois, on n'a pu démontrer d'une façon 
systématique que la consommation faible à moyenne de boissons alcoolisées par la mère (p. ex., 
jusqu'à deux verres par jour) pouvait causer des dommages au foetus ou à l'enfant.  Malgré 
l'ambiguïté que pose l'incidence de la faible consommation, certains professionnels de la santé, 
prestateurs de services sociaux et bien des gens ordinaires croient à tort que le SAF et chaque 
anomalie sont inévitables, même lorsque la consommation est faible.<P>
Cette perception peut avoir plusieurs conséquences non souhaitables, notamment :<P>
<UL>
<LI>étiqueter à tort les enfants, les stigmatiser pour toujours.
<LI>culpabiliser les parents en leur faisant croire que la consommation de petites quantités de boissons 
alcoolisées a causé des anomalies qui étaient en fait dues à d'autres facteurs.
<LI>causer une angoisse exagérée chez les femmes enceintes et leur famille.
<LI>restreindre la crédibilité des données sur les autres effets néfastes connus sur la santé que pose la 
consommation excessive d'alcool.
<LI>appuyer des interventions qui peuvent être peu efficaces, au prix de programmes destinés à des 
groupes qui pourraient profiter de programmes de prévention et de traitements appropriés.
</UL>
Par contre, il faut prendre les mesures nécessaires pour contrer le SAF.  Autrement :<P>
<UL>
<LI>le nombre d'enfants atteints du SAF à la naissance risque d'augmenter inutilement,
<LI>on pourrait donner aux enfants atteints du SAF et à leur famille des diagnostics, des traitements et un 
soutien qui sont contre-indiqués.
<LI>on manquerait de donner aux femmes enceintes qui ont des problèmes d'alcoolisme ou de toxicomanie 
des occasions d'accéder aux services de traitement.
</UL>
En l'absence d'une limite scientifiquement établie au-delà de laquelle la consommation de boissons 
alcoolisées pose un risque majeur pour la santé du foetus, les prestateurs de service ne peuvent 
donner des conseils uniformes et valides aux femmes et à leur partenaire sur la quantité d'alcool à 
consommer .  Actuellement, les prestateurs de service recommandent une consommation allant de 
l'abstinence à la consommation , selon leur point de vue personnel, mais ils ne peuvent se fonder 
sur un continuum homologué scientifiquement sur la consommation et le risque d'effets nocifs.  
Souvent, cette situation aide peu les clients et, comme indiqué plus haut, même les conseils les plus 
prudents risquent de causer des dommages non intentionnels à la mère, à l'enfant ou à la 
famille.<P>
Néanmoins, les femmes enceintes, les femmes qui prévoient devenir enceintes et leur partenaire 
ne devraient pas dépasser les limites proposées pour tous les buveurs.  Pour éviter tous les risques 
que posent les effets de l'alcoolisme foetal, il vaut mieux réduire sa consommation et il vaut encore 
mieux ne rien boire.<P>
<H5>2.  Attention limitée à l'alcool</H5>
Même s'il est incontestable que les enfants présentant les caractéristiques du SAF naissent 
uniquement de mères qui consomment des boissons alcoolisées pendant la grossesse, il est aussi 
évident que ces mères sont soumises à d'autres conditions néfastes qui sont d'importants facteurs 
dans bien des cas, notamment : une mauvaise alimentation, la pauvreté, l'usage du tabac, l'usage 
de drogues illicites, la violence, des problèmes obstétricaux par le passé, un manque de soins 
prénatals.  Par conséquent, le SAF n'est pas simplement un problème d'alcoolisme mais une 
question complexe, prenant racine dans les conditions socio-économiques sous-jacentes qui 
influencent sur tous les aspects de la santé de la mère et de l'enfant.<P>
<H5>3.  Attention limitée à la femme</H5>
Dans bien des cas de SAF où l'on dispose de données sur le père, celui-ci est décrit comme un 
buveur excessif ou dépendant à l'égard de l'alcool.  Ainsi, certains facteurs contribuant au SAF 
peuvent provenir de l'homme.  Ils peuvent être d'ordre biologique, des dommages étant causés aux 
spermatozoïdes, ou physique et psychologique, par la violence ou une autre forme d'abus de la 
mère.  Par ailleurs, il faut reconnaître et supporter l'influence positive que l'homme peut avoir sur 
la consommation de boissons alcoolisées de sa partenaire.<P>
<H3>C.  Recommandations de politiques</H3>
1.  Le syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal doit être reconnu comme un problème de santé 
communautaire, dû à l'interaction de diverses conditions néfastes, notamment la consommation 
excessive de boissons alcoolisées.  Dans ce contexte, les ressources doivent être axées sur les 
grossesses à risque élevé de SAF dans les familles à risque élevé.  De plus, il faut avoir 
suffisamment de ressources pour traiter les enfants qui présentent le SAF et pour apporter des 
soins et un soutien humain à leur famille.<P>
2.  Les programmes de prévention et de sensibilisation doivent donner des renseignements 
scientifiquement valides et pratiques.  Il faut veiller à ce que les conseils donnés sur la 
consommation de boissons alcoolisées pendant la grossesse ne causent pas plus de tort que de 
bien.<P>
3.  Tous les professionnels de la santé doivent recevoir une formation appropriée et 
scientifiquement valide sur la prévention, le diagnostic et le traitement du SAF et d'autres 
malformations congénitales liées à l'alcool.<P>
4.  Les programmes de prévention et de sensibilisation doivent être pertinents et axés sur les pères 
éventuels et d'autres personnes qui jouent un rôle important, en plus des mères.<P>
5.  Il faut entreprendre des recherches pour :<P>
a)  établir un ensemble ou des ensembles de critères acceptés pour diagnostiquer le SAF chez tous les 
groupes d'âge,<P>
b)  déterminer plus précisément l'incidence du SAF et d'autres malformations congénitales liées à l'alcool 
dans toutes les populations,<P>
c)  définir le lien entre les niveaux de consommation de boissons alcoolisées, les rythmes de consommation 
et les malformations congénitales,<P>
d)  cerner les liens entre la consommation de boissons alcoolisées et d'autres facteurs qui se répercutent sur 
la santé du foetus et de l'enfant,<P>
e)  établir quels sont les programmes les plus efficaces pour prévenir le SAF et d'autres malformations 
congénitales liées à l'alcool, et<P>
f)  indiquer le traitement et le soutien les plus efficaces à donner aux personnes qui présentent le SAF et aux 
membres de leur famille.<P>
6.  Les professionnels dans le domaine des toxicomanies doivent coordonner leurs efforts 
relativement au SAF avec ceux des prestateurs de service qui s'occupent des soins prénatals et 
génésiques, de la santé de la mère et de l'enfant, et d'autres professionnels de la santé.  Ils doivent 
chercher à améliorer les réseaux et les communications entre les prestateurs de service et à offrir 
des initiatives apportant un soutien mutuel aux femmes et à leur partenaire dans les domaines de la 
prévention, du traitement et de la recherche axés sur l'ensemble des facteurs touchant la santé de 
la mère, du foetus et de l'enfant.<P>

<TITLE>Syringe exchange: one approach to preventing drug-related HIV infection</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>SYRINGE EXCHANGE:  ONE 
APPROACH TO PREVENTING DRUG-
RELATED HIV INFECTION</H1>
<H4>A Policy Discussion Paper</H4>
<B>Prepared by: Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse CCSA National Working 
Group on Policy</B><P>
<B>December 1994</B><P>
This policy discussion document was prepared by the CCSA National Working Group on Policy, consisting 
of Peter Conley, David Hewitt, Wayne Mitic, Christiane Poulin, Diane Riley, Robin Room, Ed Sawka, Eric 
Single (chair) and John Topp.  The views expressed in this document do not necessarily reflect those of the 
organizations to which members of the National Working Group belong.<P>
<HR>
<H3>A.  Background</H3>
<H5>1.  Context</H5>
The development of substance abuse policies can be usefully viewed within the context of a 
health promotion framework.  According to this framework, a central goal of health policy is to 
promote and protect the public health.  These goals can be achieved by adopting strategies 
directed toward the maintenance and enhancement of health, avoidance of risk and the 
reduction of harm.   Health promotion and harm reduction strategies and policies must address 
the full continuum of risk of developing substance abuse problems, and are more effective if they 
involve collaboration between the groups and agencies concerned.<P>
According to the concept of harm reduction, the primary focus of drug policy should be on 
decreasing the negative consequences of drug use. Harm reduction aims to reduce drug-related 
health and social problems among individuals, families and communities.  Harm reduction 
strategies are based on a hierarchy of goals where immediate and achievable goals take priority. 
The approach selected may or may not include abstinence as a goal.<P>
Within a health promotion and harm reduction framework, slowing the spread of Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) among injection drug users is a priority issue. Agencies in 
numerous countries have adopted the position that every effort must be made to prevent the 
spread of HIV by and among injection drug users and that drug policies should not compromise 
these efforts. <P>
Injection drug use is a primary risk factor for the transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus (HIV) and thus a major contributor to the incidence of Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS).  In Canada, injection drug use is second only to homosexual/bisexual 
activity as a means of HIV transmission in men and second only to heterosexual acquisition in 
women.  Transmission occurs through the transfer of blood from one person to another by 
sharing uncleaned syringes.<P>
Approximately 100,000 injection drug users in Canada are now at risk for HIV infection.  
These persons are concentrated, for the most part, in the metropolitan areas of Montreal, 
Toronto and Vancouver, but there are injection drug users in most areas of Canada, rural and 
urban.  <P>
Traditionally, heroin has been the primary drug administered by injection in Canada; Talwin and 
Ritalin have also been popular injectables at various times in different parts of the country.  Over 
the last several years, cocaine has been used increasingly by injection drug users, either on its 
own or in combination with heroin.  There is also increasing nonmedical use of anabolic steroids 
by athletes, dancers and the general male population throughout Canada.  In such cases, 
steroids are used to promote strength and for appearance-enhancing purposes, despite the risk 
of side-effects.<P>
Risk of HIV infection is not limited to the injection drug user but also exists for their sexual 
partners;  at least 40% of injection drug users are in relationships with non-users.  Because HIV 
infection can spread from injection drug users to sexual partners and because approximately 
one-third of injection drug users are female, there is a risk that babies will be infected through 
perinatal transmission of the virus.   The possibility of transmission to the non-injecting 
community is increased by the fact that some injection drug users exchange sex for money or 
drugs and, while frequently used in such transactions, condoms are not always utilized.<P>
Preventing the spread of HIV by and among injection drug users is thus a key element in 
reducing the incidence of AIDS.  Measures taken to contain the spread of HIV will also help to 
control the spread of other infections, such as hepatitis, which can be transmitted through 
sharing of injecting equipment.<P>
<H5>2.  Syringe Exchange - One Prevention Strategy</H5>
There are several strategies for limiting the spread of HIV and other infections by and among 
injection drug users.  These include bleach kits, provision of smokable drugs and methadone 
maintenance and other forms of treatment.  One approach that has been adopted because of its 
ease and low-relative cost is syringe or needle exchange.  Because bleach does not kill the 
hepatitis viruses and is not always effective in killing HIV, provision of sterile syringes has 
become the approach of choice to ensure that injection drug users are using clean injection 
equipment.  It is also a way of establishing contact with drug users and thus is a cost-effective 
means of providing education, counselling and access to treatment and other services.<P>
Syringe exchanges opened unofficially in Canada in 1987, with the first official exchange 
opening in Vancouver in March of 1989.  Services were initially provided through fixed sites 
and street outreach, as well as limited representation at other agencies providing services to 
drug users in downtown areas.  Over time,  mobile vans have been added to services in several 
cities.  Kits containing needles, bleach and condoms are distributed through these agencies.  
<P>
Between 1989 and 1993, the Federal government cost-shared pilot outreach programs based 
on a multifaceted services model in five provinces. Over this time there has also been a rapid 
growth in other outreach programs that include syringe exchange.  Programs are now operating 
in the Yukon, the North West Territories, Calgary, Edmonton, and Halifax as well as in a 
number of communities in Quebec, BC and Ontario.  To date, there are more than 30 syringe 
exchanges in rural and urban areas in Canada, with many more under development.  In addition, 
there are now numerous clinics, pharmacies and other facilities that provide syringe exchange 
services. <P>
<H5>3.  Syringe Exchange - Does it work?</H5>
Syringe exchanges are successful at reaching large numbers of injection drug users, many of 
whom are not in touch with other services and who have had little formal help with drug 
problems. Research from around the world, including nine sites in Canada, supports the efficacy 
of syringe exchange.<P>
There is now direct evidence that increasing the availability of clean injection equipment slows 
the spread of HIV, and indirect evidence that limited access to supplies of needles and syringes 
accelerates it.  Both forms of evidence demonstrate that access to sterile injecting equipment 
and outreach in conjunction with development of trust between health care officials and injection 
drug users are critical in limiting the spread of HIV infection.<P>
Many studies have shown that the majority of injection drug users will change their behaviour to 
reduce their risk of HIV infection and that they are motivated to seek help in changing their 
behaviour.  Although some studies have shown that those who have attended exchanges are 
themselves a higher risk group than are non-attenders, behaviour change has been shown to 
occur more often among attenders of needle exchanges than amongst non-attenders.  There is 
no evidence of increased drug use in any of the communities where syringe exchanges are now 
operating. <P>
<H3>B.  Issues</H3>
<H5>1.  Competing Philosophies</H5>
The arguments for and against syringe exchange programs are based in part on different 
assumptions about the injection drug using population.  Proponents of needle exchange 
programs claim that these are important symbolically as a means of  bridging a gap between the 
drug using community and service agencies.  They argue that syringe exchange should not be 
viewed as condoning drug use but rather as reaching out to users.  Proponents argue that a 
substantial proportion of injection drug users are willing and able to change their behaviour to 
minimize the risk of HIV infection and that sustained behaviour change will be more likely if 
appropriate, culturally relevant educational messages and services are available. They maintain 
that drug users, even those who are severely drug dependent, have some control over drug use 
behaviour.  The high level of participation in syringe exchange programs supports this view. The 
requirement that syringes be exchanged helps to ensure that syringes are kept off the streets.  
Other public health measures, including disposal units and education programs, can help to 
ensure that used syringes pose a minimal health risk.<P>
Opponents of needle exchange argue that the official distribution of needles to injection drug 
users gives the wrong message.  It is claimed that needle distribution gives the appearance that 
public officials condone illegal drug use and thus implies that it is socially acceptable.  
Opponents argue that the distribution of syringes will lead to increased drug use.  They also 
argue that provision of syringes will result in used syringes being disposed of in areas where 
children can pick them up, risking HIV infection from needlestick injury.<P>
The public health stance with respect to syringe exchange has long been concrete and clear:  it is 
appropriate to act vigorously to minimize immediate harm, even if the action might involve some 
risk of future harm.  Syringe exchange is clearly within this tradition.<P>
At the political level, syringe exchange is often controversial because of legal concerns.   In 
Canada, the legal barriers, such as those posed by current paraphernalia and other drug laws, 
are more perceived than real.  For example, clean syringes are exempt from paraphernalia 
charges under current legislation.<P>
<H5>2.  Maximizing Effectiveness</H5>
Not all drug users take advantage of syringe exchange programs, nor are all programs equally 
effective in reducing the spread of HIV infection.  Some of the limiting factors are:<P>
a)	Evidence from several countries indicates that syringe exchange is not successful in reaching 
women, young users, and new users.<P>
b)	The initial preoccupation with delivering syringes has often resulted in insufficient attention 
being paid to helping people change their behaviour regarding sexual practices, drug use and 
syringe sharing.<P>
c)	Many drug users are uncomfortable about approaching exchanges in the first instance or 
subsequently accessing other support services.<P>
However, studies of syringe exchanges around the world suggest several factors important for 
maximizing effectiveness.  These include:<P>
  a)  Having the exchange physically close to where injection drug users live and having it open 
at appropriate times.<P>
  b)  Informal agreements with the police to take a non-confrontational approach with the 
clients.<P>
  c)  Supportive local community and public health programs.<P>
  d)  A staff that is acceptable to and comfortable with injection drug users.<P>
  e)  Appropriate information and counselling concerning drug use, sexual practices and HIV;  
that is, a package of services must be made available to users.<P>
<H5>3.  Partnerships</H5>
Like other health promotion strategies, harm reduction programs are more effective if they 
involve cooperation among the various groups and agencies concerned.  Those who need to be 
included in effective syringe-exchange partnerships are law enforcement officials, public health 
departments, addiction agencies, neighbourhood groups, and drug users themselves. It is 
important not only to include many different groups in forming such partnerships but also to 
ensure that their concerns are understood and, wherever possible, addressed.<P>
<H5>4.  The Role of Pharmacies</H5>
Pharmacists can play an important role in helping to prevent the spread of HIV through the sale 
of clean needles and syringes to drug users.  Pharmacies can also provide a site for dirty needle 
disposal.  Pharmacies are located in almost every neighbourhood and are therefore accessible 
to everyone.  Pharmacists are also in a position to provide public health education to customers 
who request needles and syringes, to check for apparent problems related to injection practices, 
and to discuss possibilities for addiction treatment and testing for HIV.<P>
Pharmacists can face a number of potential problems in serving injection drug users:  an 
increased risk of theft; the alienation of other customers; or an increase in the number of needles 
discarded unsafely in the neighbourhood.  However, by restricting the inventory of syringes to 
the dispensing area, being personally involved in each sale, and working in cooperation with 
other public health programs and treatment services, the pharmacist can minimize these 
risks.<P>
Traditionally, pharmacists have been reluctant to sell needles to known or suspected drug users 
or to make disposable syringes available.  More recently, however, an increasing number of 
pharmacists have responded to the AIDS problem by selling needles and syringes on request.  
This change in approach was facilitated in the late 1980s by the Canadian Pharmaceutical 
Association's recommendation to increase the availability of needles and syringes.  A number of 
provincial regulatory bodies have since liberalized their policies in this regard.<P>
<H3>C.  Policy Recommendations</H3>
1.  Efforts to prevent the spread of HIV and other infections by and among injection drug users 
should be given high priority by governments and concerned organizations.<P>
2.  As a key element in preventing the spread of HIV by injection drug users, syringe exchange 
programs that are culturally sensitive and readily accessible should be established wherever they 
are needed in Canada.  Consideration should also be given to steroid users and other groups, 
such as diabetics, who may need access to free syringes.<P>
3.  Syringe exchange programs should be viewed as only one element in a comprehensive 
strategy to reduce harms among injection drug users;  a multifaceted public health approach to 
injection drug use is needed throughout the country.<P>
4.  A climate of acceptance and understanding of the role of syringe exchanges in AIDS 
prevention should be created through increased collaboration between public health authorities, 
community groups, law enforcement and government officials, regulatory bodies, and 
pharmacists.<P>
5.  Opportunities for the safe disposal of used syringes should be increased in all communities at 
all relevant levels and sites through the implementation of comprehensive local plans.<P>
6.  Pharmacists should be encouraged to sell syringes to injection drug users.  Pharmacists 
should consider the public health benefits of selling syringes and weigh those benefits against the 
risks to the individual pharmacy.<P>
7.  Manufacturers and distributors of syringes should be encouraged to develop packaging that 
incorporates warnings about the spread of AIDS and hepatitis and diagram instructions 
regarding the safe disposal of their product.<P>
8.  In the absence of syringe exchange, full-strength bleach (although limited in effectiveness) 
should be made available to injection drug users so that they can reduce the risk of infection 
from non-sterile equipment.<P>
9.  More research should be undertaken to:<P>
  a)  determine the effectiveness of syringe exchange programs;<P>
  b)  determine the most effective ways of reaching drug injectors who are young, are female or 
are new or infrequent users;<P>
  c)  determine the incidence of injection drug use and the characteristics of injection drug users, 
including steroid users;<P>
  d)  find effective means of destroying HIV and hepatitis in injection equipment;<P>
  e)  find effective methods for encouraging individuals not to begin to inject drugs and for 
assisting individuals to stop injecting;<P>
  f)  improve patterns of referral between different kinds of services;<P>
  g)  improve outreach practices.<P>

</HEAD><BODY><H1>Bill C-7: the Controlled Drugs and 
Substances Act</H1>
<H3>A commentary by the<BR>
Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse</H3>
<H4>May 24, 1994</H4>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse welcomes the opportunity to comment on 
Bill C-7, the <I>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</I>. The Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse (CCSA) was created by an Act of Parliament in 1988 to provide a national focus for 
Canadian efforts to reduce or eliminate the harm associated with the use of alcohol and other drugs.  
Funded largely from Canada's Drug Strategy, the CCSA promotes informed debate on substance 
abuse issues, encourages public participation in harm reduction measures, and publishes information 
on the nature, extent and consequences of substance abuse. The Centre conducts a limited agenda 
of research on alcohol and other drug problems, operates the National Clearinghouse on Substance 
Abuse and publishes a newsletter, <U>Action News</U>. <P>
In preparing these comments we have consulted with a wide variety of persons in the 
substance abuse field, including pharmacologists, law enforcement specialists, 
criminologists and epidemiologists. The opinions expressed below, however, are solely 
ours and we do not claim to represent substance abuse specialists across Canada. 
<P>
The proposed legislation would combine existing federal drug statutes into one 
comprehensive law. We applaud the government for its effort to rationalize the current 
complex legal regime governing various psychoactive substances. Our purpose in 
commenting on Bill C-7 is to note some key issues and suggest means of addressing 
them. <P>
<H2>Purpose of Bill C-7</H2>
Our review of the provisions of Bill C-7 proved difficult in the absence of a statement of 
objectives.  The current explanatory note is incomplete at best.  <B><I>It is highly 
recommended that the proposed legislation include an explicit statement of 
purpose</B></I>. We propose that the following be given as the aim of the 
legislation:<P>
<UL>
<LI>to reduce or eliminate the harm to individuals, families and communities caused by substance abuse 
through the deterrence of activities which lead to such harm
<LI>to provide an integrated drug control regime, incorporating measures that support enforcement in a 
manner which is consistent with Canada's <I>Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</I>
<LI>to ensure the ready availability of psychoactive substances for legitimate medical, scientific and 
industrial purposes
<LI>to fulfill Canada's obligations under the following international treaties:
<UL>
<LI>the <I>Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs</I> (1961), as amended by the 1972 Protocol
<LI>the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971)
<LI>the Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988)
</UL>
</UL>
Our comments below are based on this understanding of the purpose of Bill C-7.  We 
have several suggestions relating to both the processes and substantive provisions in 
the Bill.<P>
<H2>Process for Amending Drug 
Schedules</H2>
According to Section 60 of the proposed legislation, "the Governor in Council may, by 
order, amend any of Schedules I to VI ..."  We strongly urge that more detailed 
consideration be given to the process by which future decisions regarding drug 
schedules would be made. The government has advocated greater public involvement 
in the development of policy. It is therefore particularly important that the processes by 
which future changes will be made should be done in an open manner, with the 
appropriate involvement of expertise from a wide variety of disciplines. <P>
<I><B>We suggest a scheduling process with significant input from a formal 
advisory committee, consisting of experts in areas such as pharmacology, law 
enforcement, epidemiology and other relevant disciplines</B></I>.   Such an 
Expert Advisory Committee would be empowered to review evidence, receive 
submissions from the public and make recommendations to the Minister of Health on 
scheduling changes.   A similar model is used for international drug conventions, where 
the World Health Organization convenes expert advisory committees to formulate 
recommendations to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs on scheduling 
decisions.<P>
The proposed scheduling process could be incorporated in Article 60.  Alternatively,  
Article 60 could place prime responsibility on the Minister of Health to make 
recommendations to the Governor in Council  while regulations would provide for the 
proposed process and place prime responsibility on the Minister of Health for 
implementation. <P>
<H2>Criteria for Drug Schedules</H2>
The proposed legislation details six schedules of substances, with different offenses 
and penalties applying to activities related to these substances. Given the importance 
of the classification of drugs into different schedules with regard to legal consequences, 
it is surprising that there are no criteria for listing of drugs in the schedules. <P>
It would greatly improve the bill to provide the underlying criteria for scheduling 
decisions. This is a challenging but not impossible task. It has been done with respect 
to the drug legislation in other countries. Even the <I>Convention on Psychotropic 
Substances </I>(1971) contains broad considerations underlying decisions on drug 
schedules. <B><I>We would therefore recommend that Article 60 be modified or 
that regulations be adopted to incorporate the following criteria with respect to 
each substance to be considered for Schedules I to IV:</B></I><P><B><I>
</I></B><P><B><I>
</I></B><UL>
<LI>Scientific evidence of its dependence potential and abuse liability, if known.
<LI>Evidence of actual abuse and its significance.
<LI>Evidence of its risk to public health and safety.
<LI>Its inclusion in one of the international drug conventions to which Canada is a Party.
<LI>Its degree of actual or potential harm relative to benchmark substances in the schedules.
<LI>Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a scheduled substance. 
</UL>
<H2>Underlying Rationale of the Drug 
Schedules</H2>
The need for criteria for drug schedules and a sound process for amending drug 
schedules is underscored by the lack of a clear rationale for the drug schedules in the 
proposed legislation.  For example, it appears illogical that coca and cocaine are in 
Schedule I and amphetamine is in Schedule II as the actions and dangers associated 
with these substances are very similar. Similarly, a distinction is made between 
amounts of cannabis greater or less than 3kg, but no such differentiation applies to 
cannabis leaf (marijuana), cannabis resin (hashish) or pure THC, despite a huge 
difference in potency of these three substances.   Even the international treaties cannot 
be used as a complete rationale for C-7 scheduling - <I>amphetamine</I> and  
<I>secobarbital </I>appear in Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic 
Substances while they appear in Schedules II and III of C-7 respectively.<P>
<I><B>We recommend that the Schedules to the Controlled Drugs and 
Substances Act be reviewed, using the process and criteria proposed</B>. 
</I><P><I>
</I><H2>Alternatives to Conviction and 
Punishment</H2>
Bill C-7 relies exclusively on conviction and punishment to achieve its goals. Unlike 
international drug treaties, there is no mention of the provision of treatment as an 
alternative to punishment.  For example, Article 22, section(b) of the <I>Convention on 
Psychotropic Substances</I> (1971) states that "...the Parties may provide, either as an 
alternative to conviction or punishment or in addition to punishment, that such abusers 
undergo measures of treatment, education, after-care, rehabilitation and social 
reintegration." Similar references to the provision of treatment are contained in Article 
38 of the<I> Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs</I> (1961), <I>as amended by the 
1972 Protocol </I>and in Article 3, Sub-paragraph 4(d) of the <I>Convention Against 
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychoactive Substances </I>(1988). <P>
We realize that alternatives to punishment can be effected through judicial discretion.  
Nevertheless, in view of the specific mention in all international drug treaties and the 
cost effectiveness of alternatives to conviction and punishment,  <B><I>we 
recommend that Bill C-7 be amended to include a provision for measures of 
treatment, after-care and social reintegration as alternatives to conviction and 
punishment.</B></I>  Conceptually, this could be accomplished in a manner similar to 
Article 11 which places responsibility on the court to consider aggravating factors in 
imposing sentences for certain serious violations.  In this case, the court could be 
directed to consider mitigating factors in less serious violations in such a way as to 
favor treatment, after-care or social reintegration measures in lieu of conviction and 
punishment.<P><B><I>
</I></B><H2>Deterrence of Cannabis 
Consumption</H2>
As we understand it, one of the major purposes of the proposed legislation is to 
combine existing legislation into one omnibus drug law rather than to introduce new 
policy. Nevertheless, we have noted some innovative provisions dealing with the so-
called designer drugs. We would recommend consideration of innovative provisions 
dealing with an another issue of emerging significance. <P>
Under the proposed legislation, trafficking of less than 3 kg of cannabis would be 
subject to lower maximum penalties than trafficking in more than 3 kg of cannabis. The 
underlying rationale for this distinction is presumably related to the relative harm 
associated with the different volumes of cannabis. In our opinion, the same rationale 
should be applied to the casual user who only possesses a very small amount for 
personal use. Consideration might be given to a wide range of penalty options for the 
possession of cannabis for personal use.  We feel that it would better serve the public 
interest to deal with relatively minor cannabis cases in a less punitive and more efficient 
manner. <P>
There is a growing consensus for the removal of incarceration for cannabis offenders.  
Proposals have been made by a wide variety of organizations such as the Canadian 
Police Association and the Canadian Public Health Association. It should also be noted 
that the elimination of incarceration as a sentencing option in cases involving small 
amounts of cannabis would reflect current court practices -persons convicted of 
cannabis possession are rarely given prison sentences.  Moreover, in many areas, the 
police have focused their attention on more serious drug offenses in the past few 
years.<P>
We want to make it perfectly clear that we are opposed to the legalization of cannabis 
(i.e., the provision of a legal source of supply), and we are <U>not</U> proposing 
depenalization (i.e. the removal of a possession offense).  Indeed such policies would 
contravene Canada's obligations under international drug treaties.  Rather we are 
suggesting that the possession of cannabis for personal use should be subject to less 
punitive penalties and we would also favour provisions to avoid a criminal record.<P>
As indicated earlier in this brief, we strongly support alternatives to conviction and 
punishment for drug users.  There are many divergent opinions on cannabis policy 
across Canada.  Some believe in a zero tolerance approach with harsh punishment.  
Others argue for extensive relaxation of cannabis controls.  Some favor a "fine only" 
system for small quantities of cannabis for personal use, say,  28 gm of cannabis or 5 
gm of cannabis resin.<P>
A "fine only" system would reduce costs associated with marijuana enforcement. It 
would clearly be more administratively efficient and could result in savings in law 
enforcement and criminal justice resources<I>. </I>In U.S. states which reduced the 
penalty for cannabis possession to a fine (the misnamed "decriminalization" states), 
there were significant reductions in law enforcement and court costs associated with 
cannabis cases. This was due to reductions in the number of arrests, administrative 
efficiencies in processing fines, savings from not incarcerating offenders and increases 
in income from fines. In an evaluation study commissioned by the state of Maine(1), 
significant savings were found in law enforcement: "From a strictly economic point of 
view, decriminalization of marijuana serves as a model of successful government 
reform because it turned a $332,600 government expense into a $16,900 profit." In a 
similar study commissioned by the state of California(2), it was found that the total cost of 
marijuana enforcement in California declined from $17 million in the first half of 1975 
prior to "decriminalization" to under $4.4 million in the first half of 1976. <P>
While lowering the costs of marijuana enforcement, reducing the penalty for cannabis 
to a fine has not led to greater use of cannabis. Many persons are reasonably 
concerned that a reduction in criminal penalties "sends the wrong message" and leads 
to increased use. There is evidence that this is not likely to occur. Although rates of 
marijuana use increased in those U.S. states which reduced maximum penalties for 
cannabis possession to a fine, levels of cannabis use increased as much or more in 
those states which retained more severe penalties. There was no indication that public 
use increased and there was no discernible impact on the health care systems in the 
so-called "decriminalization" states. The major impact was to redirect law enforcement 
priorities to trafficking and drugs other than cannabis. It is noteworthy that while 
marijuana arrests declined in all of the so-called "decriminalization" states, arrests for 
more serious offenses (possession with intent to sell, trafficking, charges involving 
other illicit drugs) increased.<P>
Thus, it appears that the law's deterrent effect was not affected by the reduction in 
penalties for first offenders. Indeed, some have argued that the provision of an 
automatic fine could increase the deterrent impact of the law because it would render 
more certain and immediate sanctions to users. It may be better to have a law which 
has a greater chance of being applied than a law which is not enforced and risks 
putting the police and the criminal justice system into disrepute.<P>
It should be noted that a "fine only" or other options would not contravene Canada's 
international treaty obligations. The <I>Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 
</I>requires that persons be subject to sanctions for unauthorized possession and that, 
in such cases,  the drug be subject to seizure and confiscation. The UN Commentary 
on the Convention clearly states that Parties "...may choose to impose minor penalties 
such as fines or even censure."  <I>The Convention</I> <I>against Illicit Traffic in 
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances</I> is somewhat more explicit in Article 3 
Paragraph 2 in requiring Parties to "...adopt such measures as may be necessary to 
establish as a criminal offense...the possession, purchase or cultivation of narcotic 
drugs... for personal consumption contrary to the provisions of the 1961 Convention..."  
In the absence of an official UN Commentary on this Convention, Parties have 
considerable discretion in interpreting these provisions in a manner consistent with their 
constitutional principles and the basic concepts of their legal systems. For example,  
the words "...as may be necessary..." will be subject to varying interpretation as each 
Party analyzes its obligations under a Convention intended to tackle drug trafficking. 
Moreover, it can be argued that the reference to the Single Convention imports its 
intent regarding offenses and penalties for possession. <P>
While CCSA sees merit in the "fine-only" approach for possession of small amounts of 
cannabis, we know that opinions vary widely across Canada as regards the most 
appropriate means of deterring the use of cannabis.  We feel that a broader 
consultation is required on this and all related penalty options.  <B><I>We therefore 
recommend that the Government initiate consultation to consider less punitive 
options for the possession of cannabis for personal use.</I>  </B><P><B>
</B><H2>Use of the Contraventions Act for 
Possession of Small Amounts of 
Cannabis</H2>
Should the consultation process result in a decision to move to a "fine only" or other 
options, these could be incorporated in Bill C-7 in a number of ways. The proposed 
legislation could be cross-referenced to the <I>Contraventions Act </I>with an 
appropriate schedule(s) listing cannabis in quantities described previously. 
Alternatively, a provision for an expiable offense could be introduced in C-7, whereby 
the payment of a specified fine within a period of time, say, 60 days, automatically ends 
the criminal proceeding and avoids a criminal conviction. <P>
<H2>Separation of Regulatory Controls over 
Pharmaceuticals from Controls over Street 
Drugs</H2>
Traditionally, the principle underlying Canadian drug control legislation has been to limit 
the production, distribution and use of psychoactive drugs to medical and scientific 
purposes.  This principle assumes that one of the major objectives of drug control 
legislation is to ensure the timely availability of psychoactive substances for medical, 
scientific and, in the case of C-7, industrial purposes.  The objectives of availability and 
control are clearly described in the preambles to the international conventions which C-
7 aims to implement in Canada.<P>
Control and availability can be competing principles.  Canadian legislators have long 
recognized the need to separate the regime to control street drugs from that intended 
to govern the availability of needed psychoactive pharmaceuticals. Past legislation, 
however, may not have gone far enough in separating these two regimes such that 
excessive burden may have been placed on the availability of medically required drugs.  
For example, the addition of a medically useful substance to the Schedule to the 
Narcotic Control Act to prevent illegitimate importation or production automatically 
carries a significant procedural and record keeping burden for health professionals 
which may not be justifiable.  In addition, some authors have argued that such 
scheduling creates a stigma with negative impact on the prescribing of needed drugs. 
To alleviate these problems, it would appear useful to incorporate into the regulations 
an independent set of schedules with attached provisions governing legitimate medical, 
scientific and industrial applications  <P>
<I><B>We strongly recommend that the regulations under the authority of Section 
54 be drafted in such a way as to create, to the extent possible, an independent 
regime governing legitimate applications for controlled substances, including 
separate schedules as may be appropriate.</B></I><P><I>
</I><H2>Fulfilling International Treaty 
Obligations</H2>
Although we do not consider these substances as being epidemiologically significant in 
Canada, the Committee should note that a number of substances which Canada is 
obliged to control under the 1961 and 1971 conventions are not covered in Bill C-7. 
These include: <P>
<UL>
<LI>N-Ethyl MDA and N-Hydroxy MDA
<LI>Midazolam
<LI>Pemoline
<LI>PEPAP
</UL>
In addition, the Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychoactive 
Substances (1988) lists a number of chemicals in Table 1 which should probably 
appear in Schedule V of Bill C-7 as follows:<P>
<UL>
<LI>N-acetylanthranilic acid, isosafrole, 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone, piperonal and safrole
</UL>
<H2>Other Issues</H2>
It is not clear to us why alcohol and tobacco are explicitly excluded from Bill C-7.  
Previous drug control legislation did not specifically exclude these substances.  Is there 
a concern that the provisions dealing with the so-called designer drugs could cover 
alcohol and tobacco, such that an explicit exemption is required?  While alcohol and 
tobacco are indeed psychoactive, we do not believe that they produce a stimulant, 
depressant or hallucinogenic effect <U>substantially</U> similar to or greater than that 
of a drug included in Schedule I, II or III.<P>
<I><B>We recommend that the provisions excluding alcohol and tobacco be 
deleted from Bill C-7.</I> </B><P>
In our opinion the definition of the word "provide" under Bill C-7 is such that the Crown 
may have great difficulty in getting a conviction for a practitioner <U>trafficking</U> in 
prescriptions within the confines of the usual office environment.  There have been a 
few such cases in the past where practitioners have exchanged prescriptions for drugs 
against various benefits.  As we mentioned earlier, it is important to separate the 
regimes that govern medical distribution from control over street drugs.  In this case, we 
believe that the nature of the practitioner - patient relationship is what distinguishes the 
<U>trafficking </U>practitioner from the practitioner who may be improperly practicing 
his/her profession.<P>
<I><B>We recommend that the provisions applicable to physicians 
<U>trafficking</U> in controlled substance prescriptions be revised placing 
emphasis on the absence of a normal practitioner - patient relationship as the 
threshold of proof for trafficking violations.</B></I><P><I>
</I>Finally we found Bill C-7 extremely hard to read.  The language is very difficult to 
follow and there are frequent references to other legislation. It is hard to imagine how 
the police and the public are to understand legislation drafted in this fashion. <P>
<H2>Recommendations</H2>
We recommend that:	<P>
<B>1.  The proposed legislation include an explicit statement of purpose.</B><P><B>
</B><B>2.  A scheduling process be adopted with significant input from a formal advisory 
committee, consisting of experts in areas such as pharmacology, law enforcement, epidemiology and 
other relevant disciplines.</B><P><B>
</B><B>3.  Article 60 be modified or regulations be adopted to incorporate the following criteria 
with respect to each substance to be considered for Schedules I to IV:</B><P><B>
</B><UL>

<LI>Its degree of actual or potential harm relative to benchmark substances in the schedules.
<LI>Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a scheduled substance. 
</UL>
<B>4.  The Schedules to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act be reviewed, using the process and 
criteria proposed.</B><P><B>

</B><B>8.  The provisions excluding alcohol and tobacco be deleted from Bill C-7.</B><P><B>
</B><B>9.  The provisions applicable to physicians trafficking in controlled drug prescriptions be

</B><H2>Conclusion</H2>
We thank the Committee for the opportunity to comment on Bill C-7. We applaud the 
government's effort to consolidate the current complex set of drug laws into a 
comprehensive piece of legislation. We have raised a number of issues and made 
several suggestions which we believe would improve the legislation. We hope that the 
Committee will utilize the opportunity to address these concerns, particularly regarding 
the process for amending drug schedules, and we would be more than willing to help in 
this challenging but essential task. <P>

The Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) has called for comment on a proposal to permit the 
advertising of spirits in the broadcast media.  Currently CRTC rules permit only beer or wine to be advertised 
on radio and television.  The CRTC proposal would permit spirits advertising under the same rules which 
apply to beer and wine.  However, existing provincial restrictions against the advertising of spirits would 
still apply.  <P>
<H4>Two Key Issues</H4>
There are two key issues involved in the CRTC proposal:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Should the advertising of any type of alcoholic beverage be permitted in the broadcast media?  
<LI>Should there be special, more strict controls over spirits as opposed to beer or wine?
</UL>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse is concerned over the potential long-term impact of increased 
advertising of alcoholic beverages.  Any increase in the promotion and advertising of alcohol beyond 
current levels is a matter of concern.  However, the continuation of discriminatory laws against any 
particular type of alcoholic beverage is not justifiable on the basis of the scientific evidence available at the 
present time.  Furthermore, present practices may contribute to a false public perception that some types of 
beverages can be consumed without a significant risk of adverse effects.<P>
The CCSA can find no valid scientific argument against the CRTC proposal to apply the same advertising 
rules to all forms of alcoholic beverages.  However, the CCSA cautions that any advertising of alcohol may 
have harmful consequences.<P>
If allowed, the advertising of spirits should be subject to the same restrictions that government regulations 
place on other types of alcoholic beverages. More importantly, it is essential that these regulations be 
strictly enforced, which they are not at present.<P>
If expenditures on advertising and promotion by the Canadian distilling industry rose to levels comparable 
to those of the brewing industry, the result would be a massive increase in the total amount of electronic-
media advertising seen by Canadians.<P>
<H4>Should Any Form of Alcohol Be Advertised?</H4>
The impact of controls over the advertising of alcoholic beverages is a matter of continuing debate.  Citizen 
groups and some health professionals have advocated a ban on all forms of advertising on the grounds that 
it increases alcohol consumption and thus, inevitably, alcohol problem levels.  However, alcohol beverage 
producers, and various related industries, have argued that alcohol advertising only affects brand 
preferences and does not increase overall alcohol consumption.<P>
There is an increasing volume of research concerning the impact of advertising on alcohol consumption.  
Generally, the results have been inconclusive.<P>
A recent review(1) distinguished four types of studies on this topic:<P>
(1) Research on the impact of advertising bans: Studies on the effect of advertising bans in British 
Columbia(2), Manitoba(3), Michigan(4), Norway and Finland(5) all concluded that there was little overall 
effect on alcohol consumption.  However, the North American studies did not involve total bans on all 
types of media or alcoholic beverages, so their results must be deemed tentative.<P>
(2) Econometric studies on the impact of changes in advertising expenditures on alcohol consumption: 
These studies examine the relationship between the amount of money spent on advertising, alcohol sales 
and other factors such as disposable income and price over time within a given jurisdiction.(6)  The findings 
have been mixed.  Studies in the U.S.(7), the United Kingdom,(8) and Canada(9) have concluded that total 
advertising outlays do not affect overall consumption, although brand preference may be influenced.  This 
conclusion is further supported by the fact that advertising expenditures have increased substantially in 
Canada since 1975 while alcohol consumption has decreased(10). On the other hand, two studies in the 
U.K.(11) found a small but significant effect on beer consumption and one study found a small effect on 
spirits consumption as well(12).  The "ad elasticity" was found to be about 0.1, meaning that a 50% increase 
in advertising expenditures would be expected to increase sales by about 5%. Finally, it should be noted 
that one study in the U.S.(13) found advertising to be related to alcohol consumption, but concluded that it 
more of a consequence than a cause. Increased sales appeared to lead to more advertising rather than vice 
versa.<P>
(3) Studies on individual exposure to advertising: These studies are typically based on surveys.  The 
relationship of exposure to advertising to levels of consumption is examined.(14) The results are again very 
mixed.  One of the most extensive and frequently cited studies concluded that "advertising stimulates 
consumption levels, which in turn leads to heavy drinking and to drinking in dangerous situations".(15)  
This study, however, has been criticized on a number of technical grounds, mainly regarding the use of 
unrepresentative samples,(16) and two other studies(17) have reached the opposite conclusion that 
exposure is not related to consumption.<P>
(4) Experimental research on the effects of advertising: These studies involve the manipulation of 
advertising exposure in experimental and control groups followed by the observation of drinking behaviour 
during or immediately after the exposure.  The initial experiments provided some evidence of advertising 
effects.  One study claimed a major impact(18), another concluded that there was an impact up to a certain 
point (a "ceiling" point on exposure),(19) and yet another experiment found an impact but only among those 
who had already been drinking.(20).  However, more recent experiments in Ontario(21) have failed to find any 
impact of advertising exposure.<P>
Thus, advertising research has produced inconclusive results. While some econometric studies have 
reported a small effect of advertising on sales and some experimental studies have found an impact either 
among persons already drinking or up to a certain level of exposure, there is a great deal of contrary 
evidence from other studies.  On balance, therefore, it cannot be claimed research supports the conclusion 
that advertising increases alcohol consumption.  <P>
However, neither is there sufficient evidence to reject the contention that advertising affects alcohol 
consumption.  The research necessary to resolve this issue is, like all real-world research on social problems, 
very difficult to conduct, expensive and chronically under-funded.  Virtually all of the research summarized 
above suffers from certain key limitations.  <P>
For example:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Advertising is only one of many factors which may influence alcohol consumption.  Even if advertising 
did have an impact, its influence would likely be small relative to other factors such as price and disposable 
income.  A relatively small advertising effect could easily be masked by these confounding influences.  
<LI>Advertising is typically targeted at particular groups whereas the research on its effects is not.  Thus, 
impacts on youth or other specific target groups might fail to appear in research evaluations.  The industry 
is reluctant to share its advertising and promotion strategies, which is not surprising in a highly competitive 
industry.
<LI>The beverage alcohol industry, particularly the brewers, engage in a wide variety of promotional 
activities other than advertising.  Sponsorship of sport and cultural events, and rock concerts, for example, 
all contribute to creating an atmosphere of uncritical acceptance of alcohol as part of "the good life."
<LI>Perhaps most importantly, all of the research to date has focused on short-term impacts of advertising.  
It may well be that most important consequences of advertising and promotional activities are cumulative 
effects which are extremely difficult to detect and require expensive, long-term research designs. 
</UL>
Clearly, there is a general sense in our society that alcohol is a relatively benign substance for the majority 
of users.  This questionable perception is likely the result of many different influences on individual 
behaviour and values over a very long period of time.  We cannot be sure, at present, of the individual effect 
of any one factor--such as alcohol advertising--in creating this norm.<P>
As we become increasingly aware of the horrendous social and health costs associated with alcohol use, we 
should be cautious of any measure that common sense at least would suggest might contribute to 
worsening the situation over time.<P>
Therefore, just as one cannot claim conclusively that advertising has an effect on alcohol consumption, so 
too one cannot claim that advertising does not have an impact.<P>
As alcohol represents one of the most serious drug problems in Canadian society today, the Canadian 
Centre on Substance Abuse is generally opposed to the relaxation of restrictions on advertising.<P>
<H4>Is There Justification for Treating One Beverage Alcohol 
Product Differently from Another?</H4>
Tax rates and regulations over the distribution and promotion of alcoholic beverages are generally more 
stringent for spirits than beer or wine.  The underlying rationale for this discrimination is not clear.  It may be 
related to a perception by many that spirits represent the beverage of excess, while beer and wine are 
beverages of moderation.  The existence of laws and regulations which discriminate against spirits may well 
contribute to a public perception that spirits contribute significantly more than beer or wine to levels of 
alcohol-related problems. <P>
The scientific evidence on beverage differences does not support the view that beer and wine are 
significantly less harmful than spirits. <P>
Due to the higher concentration of alcohol in spirits, it is possible that individuals tend to consume higher 
levels of pure alcohol when drinking spirits.  However, empirical evidence for this is lacking.  Studies on the 
effects of different types of alcoholic beverage have generally shown that it is the amount of absolute 
alcohol consumed, not the type of beverage, which determines the extent of damage and risk of adverse 
consequences. In addition, most social drinkers drink for effect, consuming the amount of absolute alcohol 
they require to feel a certain way, regardless of the form the alcohol comes in.<P>
The consumption of spirits is clearly associated with a wide variety of health and social problems.  The same 
is true for beer and wine.  However, there is little evidence to suggest that spirits contribute 
disproportionately to alcohol-related problems. Studies have found that in only a few instances is health 
damage related to the type of alcoholic beverage consumed.(22).<P>
While there is some evidence that the use of spirits is associated with death from delirium tremens(23) and 
certain cancers(24), there is a notable lack of confirmation for the hypothesis that consumption of spirits 
contributes more than the consumption of other forms of alcohol to the more prevalent types of damage 
such as liver cirrhosis(25), or cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tracts(26).  Evidence of 
differences with respect to type of beverage is inconclusive concerning psychophysical impairment, 
suicides, accidents and other types of damage.  Although the Alcoholic Beverage Study Commission(27) 
cited experimental studies linking impairment and propensity to involvement in accidents with the 
consumption of spirits, Popham et al.(28) strongly argue that the experimental conditions (specifically, the 
requirements of a prolonged fast prior to consuming alcohol) precludes generalizing these findings to actual 
drinking situations.  <P>
On the other hand, there is little doubt that beer and wine contribute substantially to indices of alcohol-
related problems. There have been historical instances of disorders which were uniquely or more strongly 
associated with the consumption of beer (eg., increased cardiomyopathy due to the use of stabilizing cobalt) 
or wine (skin lesions and cancers attributed to high arsenic levels in certain wines).(29)  Further, many 
authors have pointed out that dependence on alcohol can be developed and maintained from the use of beer 
or wine.(30)<P>
In sum, the evidence offers little to justify the view that the consumption of spirits is uniquely associated 
with alcohol abuse, while the consumption of beer or wine represent beverages of moderation.<P>

<H2>La coronaropathie</H2>
Bien des preuves épidémiologiques font le lien entre la consommation d'une faible quantité de 
boisson alcoolisée et la diminution du risque de coronaropathie chez les personnes âgées.  Il 
semble que la substance, spiritueux, bière, vin rouge ou vin blanc, importe peu.<P>
Les meilleures preuves comprennent des études effectuées auprès de populations où les taux de 
coronaropathie sont plus élevés chez les personnes qui s'abstiennent depuis toujours que chez 
les buveurs modérés.  Or, on n'est pas encore certain de réduire le risque de coronaropathie 
chez les abstinents si on les incite à boire modérément.  Toute diminution du risque varie 
probablement selon les individus et dépend de leur mode de vie et de leurs différences 
physiologiques et métaboliques.  L'incidence est peut-être même plus marquée dans un sous-
groupe génétique de la population.<P>
On peut réduire considérablement le risque de coronaropathie en employant d'autres moyens.  
La diminution du risque lié à la consommation d'alcool est moins élevée chez les personnes qui 
ne fument pas, et elle est peut-être encore moins élevée chez les personnes qui font 
régulièrement de l'exercice et qui ont un régime faible en matières grasses.  Puisque la 
coronaropathie est rare chez la population jeune, la diminution du risque chez les jeunes 
hommes et les femmes préménopausiques n'est probablement pas non plus sensible.<P>
Il existe bien des mécanismes biologiques qui expliqueraient comment l'alcool semble influer sur 
le risque de coronaropathie.  À court terme, elle entrave peut-être la formation de caillots 
sanguins; à long terme, elle semble freiner l'accumulation de plaques dans les artères.  Étant 
donné les lourds problèmes sociaux et de santé dus à la consommation d'alcool, et les 
contraintes  - médicales, religieuses et personnelles  - pour lesquelles bon nombre de personnes 
préfèrent ne pas boire d'alcool, il est primordial d'effectuer une enquête sur les mécanismes qui 
font que l'éthanol a une incidence sur le risque de coronaropathie.  De nouveaux 
éclaircissements permettraient peut-être de concevoir d'autres interventions non-alcooliques et 
de réduire le risque de contracter cette maladie.<P>
Par ailleurs, on manque de connaissances précises sur les effets de divers modes de faible 
consommation d'alcool.  Néanmoins, il y a lieu de croire qu'une personne puisse réduire en 
grande partie ses risques en buvant moins d'une consommation par jour, par exemple, une 
consommation tous les deux jours.  Par contre, le risque de contracter une maladie du coeur ne 
diminuera probablement pas chez les personnes qui prennent en moyenne un verre ou deux par 
jour, mais de façon sporadique, comme sept verres ou plus à la fois, une fois par semaine, car le 
risque des effets négatifs, comme les blessures accidentelles et la violence, augmente.  Avant de 
donner des conseils plus précis et des indices sur l'importance relative de divers mécanismes 
biologiques, on a besoin de mesurer plus exactement le mode de consommation d'alcool grâce 
à des études épidémiologiques.<P>
Même si l'on cherche à connaître la diminution éventuelle du risque de coronaropathie causé 
par une faible quantité d'alcool, il ne faut pas oublier que toute consommation d'alcool, peu 
importe la quantité, risque d'entraîner des conséquences négatives.  Pour bien des effets négatifs 
possibles de l'alcool  - par exemple, le risque de cancer du sein chez la femme, le risque 
d'hypertension ou la conduite avec facultés affaiblies  - il est difficile de définir quelle est la limite 
inférieure.  Le parfait équilibre dépend de divers facteurs, notamment le sexe, l'âge, le régime 
alimentaire, le patrimoine génétique et le milieu.<P>
<P>
<H2>La mortalité totale</H2>
Les résultats de nombreuses études sur la consommation d'alcool et la mortalité totale prennent 
la forme d'une «courbe en J» où le creux de la mortalité totale correspond à de faibles quantités 
d'alcool et les hausses significatives à une consommation importante.  La forme de la courbe 
varie selon les populations, traduisant les traits socioculturels et le mode de vie propre à 
chacune.  Lorsqu'une faible consommation est liée à une faible mortalité globale, la diminution 
de la mortalité est causée en grande partie par les répercussions sur la coronaropathie.  Ainsi, il 
n'existe peut-être aucune réduction nette du risque qui soit causée par la modération dans bien 
des populations, tout spécialement dans les pays en développement, où les taux de 
coronaropathie sont déjà faibles, en raison de régimes alimentaires sains, du faible taux de 
tabagisme et du niveau élevé d'activité physique.<P>
Les principales causes de décès, pour lesquelles la consommation d'alcool est un facteur de 
risque majeur, comprennent les accidents et la violence, certains cancers, la cirrhose et 
l'accident cérébrovasculaire dû à une hémorragie.  Pour ces causes de décès et d'autres liées à 
l'alcool, le risque est plus grand si la consommation augmente.  En outre, chez les jeunes 
adultes, la mortalité totale augmente si la consommation s'accroît.  Les décès causés par une 
maladie du coeur sont rares chez les jeunes, et l'augmentation des pertes de vies humaines, 
même si la quantité d'alcool est faible, annulle toute diminution du risque de mortalité due à une 
coronaropathie chez les jeunes.<P>
<P>
<H2>La consommation d'alcool à faible 
risque</H2>
Sauf l'éventuelle diminution du risque de coronaropathie qu'entraîne la consommation de petites 
quantités, il n'existe aucune raison majeure pour la santé physique de boire de l'alcool.  Dans 
les sociétés où l'alcool fait communément partie de la vie sociale, la plupart des gens ne boivent 
pas de boisson alcoolisée pour des raisons médicales, mais bien pour le plaisir d'être en groupe 
et leur propre satisfaction ou pour se réconforter.  L'important pour chaque buveur, c'est de 
trouver le parfait équilibre entre les avantages que lui procure la boisson et la probabilité 
croissante des dommages dus à une plus grande consommation.  Ainsi, les recommandations 
sur les quantités à faible risque ne sont pas des énoncés sur les quantités optimales d'alcool qui 
correspondent aux dommages les moins élevés, que ce soit pour les individus ou pour une 
société.  Au contraire, ce sont des lignes directrices générales sur la réduction du risque de 
dommages pour le buveur et pour son entourage.  Comme on l'a mentionné, on a remarqué que 
le risque de coronaropathie était limité même chez les personnes qui boivent de petites quantités 
à quelques reprises chaque semaine.  Quant aux autres conséquences négatives pour la santé et 
la société, la règle de base est «la modération a bien meilleur goût» - de petites quantités à 
chaque occasion et moins d'occasions de boire.<P>
Plusieurs pays, y compris l'Australie, le Canada, le Royaume-Uni et les États-Unis, ont proposé 
des lignes directrices sur la consommation d'alcool qui causerait peu de risques chez les 
individus.  Ces lignes directrices précisent les limites maximales sous lesquelles le risque de 
dommages est minimal.  Habituellement, ces lignes directrices préconisent entre un et trois 
verres par jour, les limites inférieures s'adressant ordinairement aux femmes, et signalent les 
groupes et les circonstances où il vaut mieux éviter de boire.<P>
Ces lignes directrices visent à réduire la consommation d'alcool à risque élevé et les 
conséquences économiques, sociales et de santé négatives qu'elle entraîne.  Pour des raisons de 
santé, les personnes qui boivent plus que les limites prescrites devraient se modérer, mais celles 
qui boivent moins ne devraient pas pour autant augmenter leur consommation.<P>
La mesure dans laquelle ces lignes directrices s'appliquent aux habitants d'autres pays, tout 
spécialement les pays moins développés, n'est pas certaine.  Les recommandations quant aux 
quantités à faible risque devraient tenir compte des contextes socioculturels et des modes de 
consommation d'alcool dans une société donnée.<P>
Néanmoins, il existe des circonstances où il n'est pas recommandé de boire, notamment dans le 
cas de certaines maladies et troubles psychologiques et physiques; lorsqu'on prend certains 
médicaments et psychotropes; si l'on fait fonctionner une machine ou que l'on conduit un 
véhicule; quand on est responsable de l'ordre public ou de la sécurité; et si l'on manipule des 
armes à feu, de l'équipement ou des substances toxiques ou dangereuses.<P>
<P>
<H2>L'incidence des politiques</H2>
Toutes les sociétés où l'on boit emploient une gamme de stratégies pour minimiser les 
dommages liés à l'alcool.  Les politiques officielles les plus efficaces sont celles qui influent sur le 
milieu ou la demande d'alcool chez les buveurs, notamment des politiques de taxation et de prix, 
la réglementation sur l'accès à l'alcool (y compris des limites quant aux conditions et aux heures 
de vente, la modification du milieu où l'on boit et un âge minimum légal pour boire), et des 
mesures contre la consommation d'alcool dans des circonstances dangereuses, comme la 
conduite d'un véhicule.<P>
<B>Il n'y a aucune raison d'assouplir les politiques de réglementation sur l'alcool 
malgré la diminution possible des risques de maladie causés par une faible 
consommation.</B>  <P>
Tout d'abord, bon nombre de ces stratégies visent les jeunes buveurs, les buveurs excessifs et 
ceux qui boivent dans des situations à risque élevé - groupes où la réduction nette des risques 
dus à la consommation d'alcool n'apparaîtra probablement pas.  Ensuite, des politiques moins 
ciblées, comme les taxes et les prix, ont une incidence majeure sur la consommation des 
buveurs excessifs et les taux de maladie et de décès liés à l'alcool.  Parce qu'elles sont 
rentables, les politiques de taxation constituent une importante stratégie de réduction des 
dommages.  Même si ces politiques augmentent le risque de coronaropathie chez les petits 
buveurs parce qu'ils boivent moins, ces effets sont probablement compensés par la diminution 
des dommages liés à l'alcool chez tous les buveurs.  Puisqu'on peut facilement prouver que 
l'augmentation de la consommation des buveurs modérés s'accompagne d'une hausse chez les 
buveurs excessifs, toute recommandation visant à faire augmenter la consommation totale 
d'alcool dans la population en général serait vraisemblablement contre-indiquée.<P>
<B>Étant donné la diminution possible des risques chez les personnes qui boivent peu, 
il y a lieu de préconiser qu'on remplace la consommation à risque élevé par la 
consommation à faible risque.</B>  <P>
Il faudrait fournir aux consommateurs de l'information pertinente sur la quantité d'alcool 
éthylique que contiennent les boissons alcoolisées.  Ainsi, les consommateurs et les serveurs 
éviteraient l'ivresse, les conducteurs pourraient être certains de respecter les niveaux 
d'alcoolémie prescrits pour la conduite, et les buveurs disposeraient d'information fondamentale 
sur la quantité d'alcool qu'ils prennent.  On pourrait inciter les buveurs à remplacer les boissons 
fortes par des boissons à faible teneur en alcool (par exemple, des bières faibles en alcool au 
lieu de bières ordinaires).  Les programmes d'intervention des serveurs pourraient conseiller aux 
exploitants de bars et de tavernes d'avoir et de promouvoir des boissons de teneur alcoolique 
faible.  Les règlements sur les permis de vente d'alcool pourraient exiger que les établissements 
licenciés aient des boissons faibles en alcool.  Mesure peut-être plus importante encore, on 
pourrait instaurer des politiques de taxation pour préconiser les boissons faibles en alcool, 
comme la bière, le vin et même les spiritueux de teneur alcoolique faible.<P>
<B>Les messages de sensibilisation ne devraient pas recommander en général aux 
personnes qui s'abstiennent en ce moment de commencer à boire afin de réduire le 
risque de coronaropathie ni à celles qui ne boivent pas régulièrement de commencer à 
le faire.</B>  <P>
On pourrait modifier les stratégies visant à informer les consommateurs des conséquences 
possibles de l'alcool pour qu'elles tiennent compte des résultats de recherches sur la diminution 
éventuelle du risque de coronaropathie.  On manque encore d'information clé, et d'autres 
recherches sont essentielles.  L'information nécessaire à une vue d'ensemble devra 
comprendre : les quantités d'alcool qui ont le plus de chance de réussir à réduire le risque de 
coronaropathie tout en minimisant les autres dommages; les sous-populations où le risque sera 
probablement réduit, et les situations où même la consommation d'une très petite quantité 
d'alcool peut entraîner des dommages.  Cette évaluation de l'information sur la consommation 
modérée d'alcool et la santé devrait être revue à intervalles réguliers et révisée à mesure qu'on 
dispose de nouvelles données.<P>
<P>
<H2>Les meilleurs conseils à donner aux 
personnes qui boivent peu</H2>
La consommation d'alcool entraîne divers problèmes sociaux et pertes de vies humaines et elle 
se répercute sur la santé.  Les lignes directrices qui suivent traitent des modes de consommation 
d'alcool qui risquent peu d'entraîner des conséquences négatives.<P>
<H4>1.  En règle générale, personne ne devrait boire plus de deux 
consommations standard par jour. </H4>
Cette ligne directrice a été élaborée par la Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie et 
approuvée par le Collège royal des médecins et chirurgiens du Canada, l'Association médicale 
canadienne et la Société médicale canadienne sur l'alcool et autres drogues.  Cette limite est 
fixée d'après des quantités acceptables pour les hommes adultes de corpulence moyenne et en 
bonne santé.  Les risques pour la santé sont minimaux si ce niveau est respecté.  Une 
consommation standard contient environ 13,6 grammes d'alcool, soit 12 on de bière ordinaire 
(5 % d'alcool), 5 on de vin de table (12 % d'alcool) ou 1,5 on de spiritueux (40 % 
d'alcool).<P>
<H4>2.  Des quantités inférieures conviennent à des groupes précis. 
</H4>
Des limites inférieures sont conseillées à certaines personnes en raison des différences de poids 
corporel, de la composition corporelle et du métabolisme.  Une seule consommation par jour 
peut être reliée à un risque élevé de cancer du sein chez la femme.  Dans d'autres circonstances, 
comme l'allaitement maternel, la consommation doit être réduite, même chez les buveurs à faible 
risque.  Par ailleurs, on recommande des limites réduites aux personnes de faible poids et à 
celles qui n'ont pas l'habitude de boire.<P>
<H4>3.  Les personnes qui s'abstiennent en ce moment ne devraient 
pas commencer à boire pour réduire leurs risques d'avoir des 
problèmes de santé. </H4>
On ne connaît pas encore le mode exact de consommation d'alcool à faible risque est lié à une 
réduction maximale de la coronaropathie.  Pour la plupart des personnes qui s'abstiennent, 
sinon toutes, les risques liés à l'alcool dépasseraient toute réduction du risque de contracter une 
coronaropathie.  Même si certains réussiraient ainsi à réduire leurs risques, les abstinents 
devraient envisager d'autres moyens moins dangereux, comme des exercices légers et réguliers 
et un régime réduit en matières grasses.<P>
<H4>4.  Les personnes qui ne boivent pas chaque jour ne devraient 
pas boire davantage dans le but de réduire leurs risques d'avoir des 
problèmes de santé.  </H4>
La diminution des risques grâce à la consommation d'alcool se limite probablement à de faibles 
quantités.  On pourrait réduire presqu'autant le risque de coronaropathie en prenant une seule 
consommation tous les deux jours.  Même si on ne connaît pas encore le mode exact de 
consommation d'alcool qui réduit les risques de coronaropathie, il y a lieu de croire que, en 
buvant davantage, un bon nombre de buveurs occasionnels augmenteraient probablement leurs 
risques globaux de ressentir les effets négatifs de l'alcool sur leur santé.<P>
<H4>5.  Toutes les personnes qui prennent plus de deux 
consommations par jour devraient faire preuve de modération.  
</H4>
La limite fixée à deux consommations standard par jour est un conseil de santé pour chaque 
individu et une intervention clinique qui vise à réduire la consommation chez les personnes qui 
boivent plus que le maximum où les risques sont faibles.  Les personnes qui dépassent la limite 
ne réduisent pas davantage leurs risques de contracter une coronaropathie, s'il y a lieu; au 
contraire, elles risquent encore plus de se ressentir d'une variété de mauvaises conséquences 
sociales et pour leur santé.<P>
<H4>6.  Pour réduire le risque de dépendance, il faudrait éviter de 
prendre de l'alcool au moins un jour par semaine. </H4>
Les résultats de nombreuses études démontrent un lien entre la consommation quotidienne et 
une grande consommation.<P>
<H4>7.  Toutes les personnes qui boivent devraient éviter l'ivresse.  
</H4>
L'ivresse augmente de beaucoup le risque de mauvaises conséquences sociales et pour la 
santé.<P>
<H4>8.  Il faut conseiller aux femmes enceintes de s'abstenir.  
</H4>
Cette recommandation est fondée sur le risque du syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal (SAF) et des 
effets de l'alcoolisme foetal (EAF).  On n'a pas encore fixé de seuil précis au-delà duquel le 
risque de SAF ou d'EAF est prouvé beaucoup plus élevé.  On n'a pas non plus défini le risque 
lié à des petites quantités qui entraîne une issue défavorable de la grossesse.  Certains résultats 
d'études démontrent les effets négatifs d'une consommation prénatale «modérée», d'autres, 
pas.  Le fait de boire à l'occasion et celui de prendre de l'alcool pendant le premier trimestre de 
la grossesse semblent être des comportements tout spécialement hasardeux.  De même, au 
cours d'une étude prospective, on a découvert un lien croissant entre la quantité d'alcool prise 
et les anomalies faciales chez le nouveau-né, les conséquences étant présentes même si la 
quantité d'alcool était très petite.  Comme on n'a fixé aucune quantité sûre, il serait prudent que 
les femmes enceintes ne boivent pas.  En réalité, étant donné le risque relativement plus élevé au 
cours du premier trimestre de la grossesse, on conseille aux femmes qui prévoient devenir 
enceintes de s'abstenir.<P>
<H4>9.  Dans certaines autres circonstances et pour certains 
individus, les boissons alcoolisées sont contre-indiquées, y compris 
les suivantes :</H4>
<UL>
<LI>certaines maladies et troubles psychologiques et physiques
<LI>certains médicaments et psychotropes
<LI>la conduite de véhicules ou le fonctionnement de machines
<LI>la responsabilité de l'ordre public ou de la sécurité
<LI>les personnes qui ont prouvé à maintes reprises ne pas pouvoir se maîtriser
<LI>les personnes qui n'ont pas le droit de boire de l'alcool, comme celles qui n'ont pas l'âge légal
</UL>
<P>
<H4>10.  Le médecin de famille peut déterminer des facteurs où 
l'alcool est contre-indiqué.  </H4>
Les personnes qui songent à boire davantage pour des raisons de santé devraient d'abord 
consulter leur médecin.  Par ailleurs, les médecins peuvent indiquer quels médicaments 
interagissent avec l'alcool, et offrir de l'information sur d'autres moyens de réduire le risque de 
coronaropathie.<P>

<HR>
<H4>A Collaborative Program at the University of Toronto</H4>
<HR>
<H3><I>The Program</I></H3>
Starting in September, 1992, the University of Toronto offers a new and unique Collaborative Program in 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Psychoactive Substances in the School of Graduate Studies. The purpose of 
the Program is to develop and integrate graduate training in the multidisciplinary field of the use and 
misuse of psychoactive substances.<P>
The following graduate departments are participating in the Program:  <P>
<UL>
<LI>Anthropology 
<LI>Institute of Biomedical Engineering
<LI>Clinical Biochemistry 
<LI>Community Health 
<LI>Information Studies
<LI>Institute of Medical Science 
<LI>Pharmacology
<LI>Pharmacy 
<LI>Psychology 
<LI>Social Work 
<LI>Sociology
</UL>
Master's programs requiring a thesis, thesis outline, a practicum or a directed research project, and Ph.D. 
programs are included. Students of the Collaborative Program must be registered in the School of 
Graduate Studies through one of the departments participating in the Program. <P>
<H3><I>Requirements for Master's students</I></H3>
All Master's students seeking this specialization are required to take a half-year course on 
Multidisciplinary Aspects of Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Psychoactive Substances, as well as a half-year 
course selected from a list of approved courses in the Collaborative Program on Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Other Psychoactive Substances, or a directed reading course. The listing consists of interdisciplinary core 
courses developed by the Collaborative Program, and approved courses on alcohol, tobacco and other 
psychoactive substances given by the participating departments:<P>
<UL>
<LI>ATS 3700:  Multidisciplinary Aspects of Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Psychoactive Substances (core 
course)
<LI>ATS3701:  Advanced Concepts and Interventions for Alcohol and Drug Problems
<LI>PHM1107:  Advanced Pharmacokinetics I
<LI>PHM1108: Advanced Pharmacokinetics II
<LI>PHM1110:  Chemical Basis of Drug Metabolism
<LI>JNP1017:  Neuropharmacology of Neurotransmitters Receptors
<LI>PSY2703:  Psychology of Addictions
<LI>PCL1010H:  Nicotine-Basic and Clinical Pharmacology
<LI>PCL 1005:  Behavioural Pharmacology
<LI>SWK 4616:  Drug dependence-Treatment Perspectives
<LI>SOC6123:  Sociology of Addiction
</UL>
<H3><I>Requirements for Ph.D. candidates</I></H3>
Ph.D. candidates in the Collaborative Program are required to take the half-year course on 
Multidisciplinary Aspects of Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Psychoactive Substances if they have not already 
done so, plus one other half-year course (not taken previously) from the approved listing of courses in the 
Collaborative Program or a directed reading course. <P>
<H3><I>Other requirements</I></H3>
Students in the Collaborative Program must meet all requirements of their home department in terms of 
coursework and thesis work. For both the Master's and Ph.D. degrees, the student's thesis or equivalent 
requirement must deal with a subject in the field of alcohol, tobacco and other psychoactive substances. 
<P>
The thesis is supervised and evaluated in the same manner as others in the home department, but 
normally involves supervisory and/or examining professors from other disciplines represented in the 
Collaborative Program. Upon completion of the Program, transcripts issued by the School of Graduate 
Studies denote a specialization in Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Psychoactive Substances.<P>
<H3><I>Special fellowships</I></H3>
Students in the Collaborative Program may be eligible for special fellowships<P>
<H3><I>Research connection</I></H3>
The Program will also feature lecture series and other special events on topics related to alcohol, tobacco 
and other psychoactive substances. <P>
A key feature of the Collaborative Program is the connection between graduate training and research on 
the etiology, treatment and prevention of substance abuse problems. <P>
The Program involves a collaboration between the Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario, the 
Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse and the University of Toronto. <P>
The Collaborative Program thus involves researchers and others involved directly in various aspects of 
treatment and prevention of substance abuse problems. Students have a unique opportunity to take 
advantage of this large pool of expertise. <P>
<H4>Students may apply at any time, but preferably by July 
1.</H4>

<TITLE>Action News letter</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT COLOR="0000FF"><H2>Important notice to <I>Action News</I> readers</H2></FONT>
Dear Colleague:<P>
During the 1980s, public concern over health, social and economic problems related to substance abuse was very strong, and governments in the US and Canada responded by funding countermeasures such as the US War on Drugs and Canada's Drug Strategy (CDS). Since that time, attention to these vital issues has eroded, and governments generally now spend less and less on prevention and treatment of drug abuse and alcoholism. Sadly, this is happening at a time when use and abuse of drugsincluding heroinamong North American youth appears to be on the rise.<P>

The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse was originally funded under the CDS at a level of $2 million a year, but is now receiving less than 40% of that original allocation. The Drug Strategy "sunsets" this year, and the Centre has been told that no further funding can be committed after March 31, 1997. The real crunch came earlier this year with a 50% cut in our core grant over last year's allocation. Last year, the Centre was able to generate 38% of its budget from the sale of products and services, and efforts toward financial self-sufficiency continue. However, without financial support for activities whose costs cannot be fully recoveredthe operation of the National Clearinghouse on Substance Abuse, for examplethe future of the Centre is in serious jeopardy.<P>

The funding crisis has led to big changes at CCSA. The organization has been severely downsized and some of the tasks not specifically required by CCSA's legislation have been dropped. Unfortunately, CCSA's newsletter, Action News, is one of these. Judging from the reader response we've had over the years, it will be sorely missed. The newsletter was especially useful as a consistent forum for information exchange after a number of independent provincial addictions agencies began to disappear from the scene.<P>

As a paid subscriber, you are undoubtedly concerned by the loss of Action News. In the larger context, you may agree with us that the funding dilemma behind the demise of Action News is indicative of a faltering commitment at various levels of government to deal seriously with substance abuse issues. If you are disturbed by the absence of leadership in this area, tell us . . . and let our politicians know. The time to act is now, while there is still enough left of Canada's Drug Strategy to remind our leaders that decisive action is not only possible, but critical. A year from now it will be too late.<P>

Sincerely<P>

Bill Deeks, Acting Chairman<BR>
Jacques LeCavalier, Chief Executive Officer<P>

A number of studies have been released in the past few months that relate to use of alcohol, tobacco and 
other drugs by youth.  The following links provide statistical information about this important issue.<P>

"Between 1994 and 1995, there was a continuing increase in the rate of past month illicit drug use among 
youths, from 8.2 percent to 10.9 percent.  The rate has doubled since 1992.  Significant increases in past

<U>Re: Public Notice CRTC 1996-108</U><P><U>
</U>Dear Mr. Darling:<P>
We applaud the CRTC for incorporating its Code for Broadcast Advertising of Alcoholic 
Beverages within the new regulatory framework issued in August, 1996. However, we are very 
concerned that the CRTC appears to be washing its hands of any responsibility to enforce 
compliance with its own Code.<P>
When we wrote to you last year, we asked that the CRTC retain ultimate responsibility for 
enforcing its advertising Code. We see no evidence in your recent announcement of how 
compliance with the Code will be guaranteed. Indeed, there is no assurance that the pre-
clearing of advertisements will even continue if the broadcast industry should choose to ignore 
the Commission's "encouragement" that it develop such a process. What mechanism, if any, will 
the CRTC use to enforce its Code once responsibility has been turned over to the industry? In 
addition, what input will there be in the pre-clearance process from members of the public who 
have concerns about the broadcast advertising of alcohol? Who will determine the composition 
of pre-clearance panels?<P>
On the subject of countermeasure advertising, we are not encouraged that the CRTC merely 
"expects" the industry to expand its efforts to provide a balanced view of alcohol. Many groups, 
including the CCSA, had suggested that regulating a spending level of 10-15 per cent of overall 
alcohol advertising budgets on countermeasure advertising was a reasonable step since it would 
merely formalize current practice. We were pleased to see that the Commission will require the 
industry to report annually on its performance in this regard, but we wonder if the CRTC 
envisages some kind of objective test of what constitutes balance in the portrayal of alcohol. We 
strongly urge the CRTC to include representatives of the public health sector in such a 
performance review. As well, we feel a great opportunity will be missed if the Commission does 
not also use this annual occasion to monitor compliance with the Code, as we suggested last 
year. This process would also benefit from the participation of public health agencies.<P>
We understand and acknowledge the need to eliminate restrictions on who may sponsor an 
alcoholic beverage advertisement, although we remain convinced that more advertising will 
inevitably lead to greater consumption. Assurances that these new advertisers will be obliged to 
adhere to the Code are of little comfort if there is no visible means to enforce the Code. As 
well, the Code does not adequately address the special issues around retail advertising. For 
example, the Code is silent on the issue of advertising on the basis of price. A price war among 
retailers could have disastrous effects as alcohol becomes more and more affordable to high-
risk groups such as youth. Controls on alcohol pricing, traditionally exercised in the form of 
taxation, have proven to be one of the most effective ways of reducing alcohol-related harm. 
Advertising price wars will surely undermine such controls.<P>
When we wrote to you last year, we expressed qualified approval of the direction the CRTC 
was proposing, recognizing the pressures and restraints facing the Commission. We made a 
number of suggestions that we felt would allow the CRTC to deal with its problems while 
retaining its vital role as the only real watchdog in the area of broadcast advertising of alcohol. 
The Commission has acted well in establishing the Code, but in almost every other respect has 
more or less left the industry to its own devices. The CRTC's new direction has turned out to be 
one step forward and two steps back.<P>
I am keenly interested in how the Commission will proceed with its proposed new framework. 
We hope that your optimism about the industry's ability to police itself is borne out by future 
events. The health of millions of Canadians depends on it, especially at a time when government 
funding for prevention and education is evaporating.<P>
Sincerely<P>
Jacques LeCavalier, Chief Executive Officer<P>

L'abus de la drogue constitue l'un des plus grands problèmes de santé et de 
société au Canada. Selon un rapport d'étude des coûts économiques fondée 
sur les données de l'année 1992 et publié par le Centre canadien de lutte 
contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies en juin 1996, 21 % de tous les décès 
survenus au Canada en 1992 et 23 % des années de vie potentielle perdues 
étaient imputables à l'abus de l'alcool, du tabac et des drogues illicites.<P>
Les hospitalisations dues à l'abus de drogues représentaient 8 % de tous les 
cas d'hospitalisation et 10 % du nombre total des jours d'hospitalisation.<P>
Le CCLAT estime que l'abus des drogues, en 1992, a coûté plus de 18,4 
milliards de dollars à l'économie canadienne, soit 649 $ par habitant, ou 
quelque 2,7 % du produit national brut.<P>
<H2><A NAME = 
rising></A>Recrudescence de l'usage de la 
drogue</H2>
Après une rémission de plus de dix ans, des données troublantes indiquent une 
reprise de la consommation des drogues illicites. La proportion des Canadiens 
ayant déclaré, dans le cadre d'une enquête, avoir consommé du cannabis 
l'année précédente est passée de 4,2 % en 1993 à 7,4 % en 1994. Cette 
hausse est particulièrement marquée chez les adolescents et les jeunes 
adultes.<P>
L'usage de la cocaïne est passé de 0,3 % en 1993 à 0,7 % en 1994, et la 
proportion des répondants ayant déclaré avoir consommé du LSD, de l'héroïne 
ou du speed l'année précédente est pour sa part passée de 0,3 % en 1993 à 
1,1 % en 1994.<P>
La Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie (ARF) de l'Ontario a aussi 
constaté des taux nettement plus élevés du tabagisme et de la consommation 
d'alcool chez les jeunes des 7e, 9e, 11e, et 13e années, dans cette province, 
entre 1993 et 1995.<P>
<H2><A NAME = 
end></A>Disparition de la Stratégie canadienne 
antidrogue</H2>
La Stratégie canadienne antidrogue, lancée en 1987 et reconduite en 1992, 
prendra fin le 31 mars 1997. Les programmes de santé développés dans le 
cadre de la Stratégie sont présentement fusionnés avec de nombreux autres 
dossiers sanitaires et sociaux sous l'étiquette «santé de la population». On 
ignore encore quelle priorité et quel niveau de financement les programmes 
consacrés à la drogue et à l'alcool recevront à la suite de cette restructuration, 
mais tout semble indiquer qu'ils seront sévèrement touchés.<P>
Le Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies, créé par 
une loi du Parlement comme tribune nationale dans le dossier de la drogue, 
cessera également d'exister le 31 mars 1997 si aucun nouvel engagement 
financier n'intervient au cours des prochains mois. Or, le Comité permanent de 
la santé déposera son rapport trois mois après la date de la disparition de la 
Stratégie canadienne antidrogue et de la fermeture du Centre.<P>
Le Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies a occupé 
une position particulière dans le secteur de la lutte antidrogue, agissant comme 
entité multidisciplinaire faisant le pont entre secteurs privé et public, 
responsables de programmes et décideurs, théoriciens et praticiens, 
épidémiologistes et économistes, fournisseurs d'information et consommateurs, 
chercheurs autochtones et universitaires non autochtones, spécialistes en 
prévention et policiers. Le CCLAT a toujours bénéficié d'un appui 
particulièrement favorable de la part du secteur judiciaire et policier, 
principalement du Cabinet du Solliciteur général et de la Gendarmerie 
royale.<P>
Avec le démantèlement systématique des organismes provinciaux et territoriaux 
autonomes de lutte antidrogue amorcé il y a quelques années, le rôle crucial du 
Centre n'a cessé de se confirmer. Seulement trois de ces organismes 
demeurent dans tout le Canada. Le vide créé par leur absence en matière de 
connaissances et d'experts-conseils a eu pour effet de multiplier la demande 
pour les nombreux produits et services d'information du Centre, tels le Profil 
canadien, le Centre national de documentation sur l'alcoolisme et les 
toxicomanies, et le Service national d'information sur le SAF/EAF.<P>
Le Centre s'est efforcé de contourner les graves compressions budgétaires dont 
il a fait l'objet, d'une part, en se fiant de plus en plus au réseau World Wide 
Web pour diffuser son information et, d'autre part, en offrant ses produits et 
services selon la formule de recouvrement des coûts. Cependant, de nombreux 
clients sont dans l'impossibilité de payer, et le Centre doit continuer de compter, 
dans une certaine mesure, sur le financement public.<P>
<H2><A NAME = 
federal></A>Leadership et engagement du 
gouvernement du Canada</H2>
Le Centre de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies prie le Comité 
permanent de la santé d'obtenir du gouvernement du Canada une ferme 
réaffirmation de son leadership et de son engagement face aux problèmes 
cruciaux de l'abus de drogues. Il existe un besoin impérieux d'assurer au peuple 
canadien que le gouvernement fédéral n'entend nullement négliger la 
responsabilité qui lui revient de protéger la santé et le bien-être des citoyens les 
plus vulnérables, dont les enfants.<P>
Le Centre prie en outre le Comité de presser Santé Canada de lever toute 
ambiguïté pouvant régner quant à la nouvelle approche axée sur la santé de la 
population et d'affirmer clairement aux Canadiens que leur longue confiance en 
la valeur préventive des programmes et des politiques antidrogue demeure 
justifiée.<P>

Le Centre de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies a été créé par une loi

Le CCLAT exploite le Centre national de documentation sur l'alcoolisme et les 
toxicomanies, qui rassemble et diffuse de l'information, et compile et tient à jour 
plusieurs bases de données à cette fin. Il coordonne le Réseau national 
d'information sur l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies et exploite, avec la 
participation financière de Santé Canada et de l'Association des brasseurs du 
Canada, le Service d'information sur le syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal. Il fournit 
en outre gratuitement, depuis son site Web, de l'information sur la toxicomanie 
et des «liens-clés» à de nombreux autres fournisseurs de données dans le 
monde entier. Enfin, il publie de nombreux répertoires, profils statistiques, 
dépliants, documents de recherche et d'orientation, ainsi que des rapports 
spéciaux.<P>
Le Centre occupe une position particulière qui lui permet de réunir entre eux 
divers partenaires des secteurs public et privé, afin de poursuivre des projets 
qu'il serait impossible de réaliser unilatéralement. De plus, avec la disparition au 
cours des récentes années de tous les organismes provinciaux antidrogue 
autonomes, sauf trois, le Centre est de plus en plus souvent appelé à conseiller 
ses clients provinciaux et à coordonner nombre d'activités 
multijuridictionnelles.<P>
Voici, à titre d'exemples, certaines des réalisations que le Centre a rendu 
possible grâce à ses activités de coordination et à sa création de 
partenariats :<P>

<H2><A NAME = 
reviewing></A>Examen de la politique canadienne 
antidrogue</H2>
L'examen de la politique antidrogue la plus célèbre de l'histoire canadienne, soit 
de la Commission LeDain, a duré quatre ans et produit plusieurs volumes de 
résultats de recherche et d'analyse. D'un certain point de vue, le présent Comité 
a la tâche plus facile que la Commission LeDain, puisqu'en s'attachant 
exclusivement aux stratégies de réduction de la demandeprévention, 
sensibilisation, traitement et réadaptationil lui est possible d'éviter certains 
aspects de l'application de la loi et de la réduction de l'approvisionnement qui 
ont jadis divisé les membres de la Commission.<P>
On peut par contre affirmer que son travail sera plus ardu que celui de la 
Commission, en ce sens qu'il devra examiner toutes les substances 
psychotropes, licites et illicites, alcool et tabac compris, et ce, en seulement 
neuf mois. Aussi, nous félicitons le Comité d'avoir bien voulu entreprendre cette 
lourde tâche, et nous sommes particulièrement heureux que les deux drogues 
les plus mortellesalcool et tabacsoient inscrites à l'étude.<P>
Il est important de ne pas laisser les médias, vu leur penchant pour les histoires 
de drogues illicites, dicter la politique à suivre et semer le mépris quant à 
l'importance des problèmes liés au tabac et à l'alcool. On risquerait sinon de se 
retrouver à tenir le télescope par le mauvais bout, ce qui minerait gravement la 
crédibilité de tout groupe prétendant mener une étude sérieuse sur l'abus des 
drogues dans ce pays.<P>
La Commission LeDain a posé les jalons des études ultérieures sur la politique 
antidrogue, mais n'a pas réussi par contre à influer concrètement sur le 
problème même. Tel n'a pas été le cas cependant d'une autre étude sur le 
même sujet, réalisée il y a tout près de dix ans. C'est en décembre 1986 que le 
Comité permanent de la santé et du bien-être social de la Chambre des 
communes a en effet entrepris d'étudier l'abus des drogues au Canada, 
s'attachant d'abord aux drogues illicites. Mais sur l'insistance des nombreux 
témoins, il a vite étendu la portée de l'étude à d'autres substances intoxicantes, 
dont l'alcool.<P>
<H2><A NAME = 
role></A>Le rôle du gouvernement fédéral</H2>
Partout au pays, les témoins comparaissant devant le Comité ont souligné la 
nécessité que le gouvernement fédéral revoie son rôle dans la lutte contre 
l'abus d'alcool et de drogues. Les témoins ont admis le pouvoir juridictionnel des 
provinces sur les programmes des soins de santé, de prévention et de 
sensibilisation, mais ont néanmoins insisté sur l'obligation du gouvernement 
fédéral d'assurer l'orientation et la coordination de l'action canadienne 
antidrogue. Ils ont pressé le gouvernement d'«investir» dans la réduction de la 
demande en instaurant des mesures susceptibles de compléter les efforts déjà 
dépensés pour freiner l'approvisionnement des drogues dans la rue.<P>
On avait alors invité le gouvernement à participer activement à la lutte 
antidrogue en prévoyant les sources de financement pertinentes et les 
mécanismes de partage des coûts, en assumant le leadership et la coordination 
qui s'imposaient, en développant et en diffusant des programmes-pilotes, ainsi 
qu'en améliorant la législation et les mesures policières de l'époque.<P>
Ainsi, le 25 mai 1987, le gouvernement du Canada a annoncé l'adoption d'une 
nouvelle «stratégie nationale antidrogue»l'actuelle «Stratégie canadienne 
antidrogue»par laquelle il s'engageait notamment à consacrer, sur cinq ans, la 
somme supplémentaire de 210 millions de dollars à l'action antidrogue. Il 
allouait auparavant quelque 168 millions de dollars par année aux programmes 
de réduction, tant de l'approvisionnement que de la demande.<P>
En 1992, on a reconduit le mandat de la Stratégie canadienne antidrogue, 
octroyé de nouveaux fonds, et ajouté à sa mission le programme contre l'alcool 
au volant de Santé Canada. Le coût total des dépenses de la deuxième phase 
quinquennale a alors été fixé à 270 millions de dollars.<P>
La Stratégie, qui se voulait une réponse sociétale exhaustive à un problème 
grave et complexe, comportait cependant une lacune majeure. L'absence 
d'objectifs mesurables ne permettait pas d'en faire une évaluation valable. A la 
question de savoir si la Stratégie a été utile, la plupart des intervenants du 
secteur de la toxicomanie répondront sans doute dans l'affirmative, mais sans 
pouvoir le prouver. Indépendamment des mesures que recommandera le 
présent Comité, en juin prochain, il conviendrait avant toute autre action de fixer 
des objectifs clairement définis devant permettre à l'avenir d'évaluer les 
mesures adoptées.<P>
<H3>L'avenir du CCLAT</H3>
Le budget de la phase I de la Stratégie comportait un projet de débours annuel 
de 2 millions de dollars pour le financement du Centre canadien de lutte contre 
l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies. Rappelons ici qu'un seul membre du Parlement 
s'était opposé à la loi créant le Centre, justement parce qu'elle estimait que le 
budget annuel de 2 millions de dollars proposé ne pouvait suffire à réaliser les 
objectifs ambitieux du Centre. La loi a néanmoins été adoptée, avec l'appui de 
tous les partis.<P>
Bien que l'on ait injecté des fonds additionnels dans la phase II de la Stratégie, 
on a progressivement réduit le budget du Centre à 1,4 million de dollars. En 
avril dernier, le Centre apprenait que cette somme serait réduite de près de la 
moitié, passant ainsi à trois quarts de million de dollars pour l'exercice financier 
1996-1997. Il a alors été avisé qu'il s'agissait de la dernière année de 
financement, aucun autre engagement de fonds n'ayant encore été prévu pour 
les années suivantes.<P>
<H2><A NAME = 
sunsetting></A>La disparition de la Stratégie canadienne 
antidrogue</H2>
Au moment où le Comité présentera ses recommandations, en juin 1997, la 
Stratégie canadienne antidrogue aura cessé d'exister depuis trois mois déjà, et 
à moins qu'un changement majeur ne marque le cours actuel des événements, 
le Centre aura lui aussi mis définitivement le verrou. Selon nos calculs, les 
fonds consacrés par le gouvernement du Canada à la lutte antidrogue 
retomberont aux niveaux d'avant 1987 ou encore plus bas. Il n'est pas du tout 
clair quelle priorité sera accordée à la sensibilisation et à la prévention en 
matière de drogues dans le cadre encore ambigu du programme de la santé de 
la population.<P>
Tout observateur externe qui examine l'orientation de notre pays dans son 
engagement à prévenir le fléau de la drogue pourrait en déduire que nous 
avons réussi à régler nos problèmes et que nous sommes prêts à passer à 
d'autres dossiers. Malheureusement, comme nous le démontrerons plus loin, tel 
n'est pas le cas.<P>
Un tel observateur pourrait d'ailleurs être frappé par le fossé qui existe entre les 
milliards de dollars recueillis chaque année sous forme de taxes fédérales sur 
l'alcool et le tabac, de biens saisis et de produits du crime lié à la drogue, et les 
infimes sommes consacrées par le gouvernement du Canada à la réduction des 
méfaits. Or, moins le gouvernement investit dans la réduction de la demande, 
plus l'économie s'en trouve affectée. L'once de prévention que l'on aura voulu 
épargner se traduira par une tonne de maladies et de décès, de coûts en soins 
de santé, de rues malfamées et de collectivités dévastées par le crime, de 
tribunaux et de prisons surchargés, et fera tache d'huile sur l'image du Canada 
à l'étranger.<P>
Le gouvernement du Canada est allé à la limite de ce que la population et le 
régime judiciaire surchargé sont prêts à accepter, en ce qui concerne les 
moyens de réduire l'approvisionnement en drogues. Le projet de loi C-8, Loi 
réglementant certaines drogues et autres substances, investit la police des 
pouvoirs sans précédent de stopper l'approvisionnement des collectivités, mais 
la police est la première à affirmer qu'elle ne peut pas continuer à colmater les 
fuites de la digue si l'on ne fait pas plusbeaucoup pluspour réduire la 
demande. Elle se joint d'ailleurs à notre demande pressante de renforts.<P>
<H2><A NAME = 
reaffirm></A>Réaffirmation de la nécessité d'un

Nous croyons fermement au rôle majeur que tiendra le présent Comité dans la 
reprise de la lutte antidrogue. Nous souhaitons qu'il réaffirme la nécessité pour 
le gouvernement du Canada de faire preuve de leadership et d'engagement 
dans ce dossier et qu'il recommande un investissement assidu dans les 
programmes de prévention, de sensibilisation et de traitement. Nous ne 
demandons pas le rétablissement systématique de la Stratégie canadienne 
antidrogue. Il est possible que certaines mesures de la Stratégie soient 
dépassées. Néanmoins, nous souhaitons que le Comité recommande d'autres 
mesures fermes et novatrices pour lutter contre un problème envahissant.<P>

Le Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies participe à 
plusieurs projetsnotamment la publication de nombreux produits d'information
permettant de suivre les tendances de l'usage et de l'abus des drogues licites et 
illicites au Canada. Pour obtenir une information plus détaillée sur ces 
tendances, nous prions le Comité de consulter Profil canadien : l'alcool, le tabac 
et les autres drogues. Pour connaître les plus récentes informations sur la 
toxicomanie, il convient de consulter le site Web du Centre 
(http://www.ccsa.ca).<P>
Selon l'information fournie par ces sources, la consommation de l'alcool, du 
tabac et des autres psychotropes entretient de très graves problèmes de santé 
et de société au Canada. L'abus de drogues compte parmi les principales 
causes de décès et de maladies évitables et a un impact considérable sur 
l'économie canadienne.<P>
L'alcool continue de taxer lourdement le bien-être des Canadiens, tout 
particulièrement des jeunes et des populations plus vulnérables, notamment les 
peuples autochtones, les femmes enceintes, les handicapés et les aînés. Or, la 
prise d'alcool en combinaison avec d'autres drogues, dont les médicaments, 
demeure largement inexplorée. On sait aussi que les effets désinhibiteurs de 
l'alcool et des autres psychotropes contribue à propager l'infection au virus du 
sida, puisque les consommateurs ainsi désinhibés ont tendance à pratiquer des 
activités à risque, dont les rapports sexuels non protégés et l'utilisation de 
seringues contaminées.<P>
La consommation du tabac continue de régresser parmi la  population en 
général (15 ans et plus), mais a enregistré une hausse considérable chez les 
adolescents depuis 1993, selon au moins une étude importante (Enquête de 
l'usage de la drogue chez les élèves de l'Ontario, ARF, 1995). Certains critiques 
au sein du groupe de pression antitabac jettent le blâme de cette hausse sur la 
diminution des taxes sur les cigarettes décrétée par le gouvernement du 
Canada en 1994. Les implications à long terme de cette tendance à la hausse 
chez les adolescents soulèvent de grandes inquiétudes puisque nous savons 
qu'un taux élevé des personnes qui commencent à fumer avant l'âge de vingt 
ans deviennent des fumeurs réguliers.<P>
La consommation des drogues illicites accuse actuellement une remontée pour 
la première fois depuis plus de dix ans, remontée qui touche surtout les jeunes 
Canadiens. L'enquête menée auprès des élèves de l'Ontario, par exemple, 
indique de fortes augmentations de la consommation de drogues telles que le 
cannabis, les méthamphétamines («speed»), le PCP, la cocaïne et l'ecstasy. 
Des études réalisées aux Etats-Unis ont produit des résultats analogues, 
brossant un tableau troublant de la reprise de la drogue chez les jeunes nord 
américains.<P>
<H3>Comment expliquer la remontée des 
drogues illicites?</H3>
Le Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies se fait 
souvent demander pourquoi, après une si longue période de recul, y a-t-il 
reprise de la consommation des drogues illicites. Il n'existe pas de réponse 
simple à cette question. Le mouvement matérialiste et conservateur d'après-
guerre a donné lieu, pendant dix ans, à un contre-courant qui a nourri la 
révolution de la drogue des années 60. Aujourd'hui, la situation catastrophique 
de l'économie, l'éclatement de la famille et de la communauté, et le sens 
général d'impuissance constituent peut-être des facteurs encore plus 
susceptibles de nourrir l'abus, surtout lorsque combinés à une disponibilité et à 
un choix de drogues difficilement concevables il y a trente ans, et aussi, selon 
certains, à des attitudes parentales plus libérales.<P>
La politique sociale a aussi un impact sur la consommation des drogues, 
quoique ses effets soient extrêmement difficiles à mesurer et à évaluer. Nous 
pouvons observer que la consommation de la drogue a considérablement 
régressé tout au long des cinq premières années d'existence de la Stratégie 
canadienne antidrogue, puis qu'elle a commencé à remonter durant la 
deuxième phase. Or, les efforts de prévention et de sensibilisation dépensés 
durant la première phase visaient les populations générales de la société, dont 
surtout les jeunes encore à l'école. Durant la deuxième phase, on s'est 
principalement adressé aux jeunes de la rue et aux autres groupes très 
vulnérables.<P>
La résurgence du phénomène de la drogue tel que nous le connaissons 
aujourd'hui est largement le fait de la jeunesse en général, ce qui représente 
peut-être le lourd tribut que nous devons payer pour avoir modifié notre cible et 
négligé cette population au cours de la deuxième phase. A toute fin pratique, il 
est clair que notre effort de prévention doit viser tous les jeunes sans exception. 
Le Centre croit que tous les jeunespremiers de classe comme décrocheurs
sont vulnérables à la consommation de la drogue et devraient être considérés 
comme faisant partie intégrante des populations à risque.<P>
Même s'il peut être difficile de connaître les raisons qui incitent chacun à 
consommer de la drogue, une chose est très claire, à savoir qu'à toutes choses 
égales d'ailleurs, la consommation totale de drogues par une population donnée 
augmentera et diminuera proportionnellement à la taille du groupe. Il ne faudrait 
pas oublier non plus que les enfants de la génération du baby-boomsouvent 
appelés la génération de l'«écho-boom» ou du «mini-boom»arrivent 
aujourd'hui à l' étape de l'adolescence, période où l'attrait du risque est à son 
plus fort.<P>
Le pas de géant amorcé au milieu des années 60 vers une consommation 
accrue des drogues illicites était à plusieurs égards un simple fait de chiffres 
puisque des centaines de milliers d'enfants nés après 1946 atteignaient alors 
l'étape de l'adolescence. Quiconque doute de l'impact éventuel de la génération 
de l'«écho-boom» sur la consommation de drogues au cours de la prochaine 
décennie devrait se rappeler la hausse continue qui a marqué la consommation 
et l'abus de ces produits depuis le milieu des années 60 jusque vers la fin des 
années 70 et le début des années 80.<P>
<H2><A NAME =

l'abus des drogues au Canada</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Le taux des Canadiens ayant déclaré avoir consommé de l'alcool durant les douze mois précédant 
chacune des enquêtes nationales est tombé de 80 % en 1979 à 72 % en 1994.
<LI>Le taux des Canadiens ayant déclaré avoir fumé a de son côté constamment régressé, passant de 
50 % en 1960 à 44 % en 1975, à 40 % en 1981, à 32 % en 1989 et à 27 % en 1995. Selon de récentes 
études, le taux des jeunes fumeuses rejoint aujourd'hui celui des jeunes fumeurs. L'ARF a pour sa part 
signalé une hausse importante du tabagisme (de 23 % en 1993 à 27,9 % en 1995) chez les jeunes élèves 
des classes de 7e, 9e, 11e, et 13e année en Ontario.
<LI>Environ un adulte canadien sur quatre déclare avoir déjà consommé une drogue illicite. Après plus 
d'une décennie de régression, des indices troublants révèlent une remontée de la consommation des 
drogues illicites. Le taux des Canadiens ayant déclaré avoir consommé du cannabis durant l'année 
précédant l'enquête est passé de 4,2 % en 1993 à 7,4 % en 1994. La remontée du cannabis est 
particulièrement marquée chez les adolescents et les jeunes adultes. La consommation de la cocaïne a 
augmenté de 0,3 % en 1993 à 0,7 % en 1994, et le taux des personnes ayant déclaré avoir consommé du 
LSD, de l'héroïne ou du speed durant l'année avant l'enquête est passé de 0,3 % en 1993 à 1,1 % en 1994.
</UL>
<H2><A NAME = 
health></A>Conséquences pour la santé et méfaits 
sociaux</H2>
La consommation de substances psychotropes a des effets dévastateurs sur la 
santé des Canadiens. On associe aussi l'abus de l'alcool et des drogues illicites 
aux conséquences sociales néfastes telles la criminalité, les comportements 
violents, le chômage et la piètre productivité, les troubles familiaux, ainsi qu'aux 
abus commis envers les conjointes et les enfants.<P>
<UL>
<LI>On estime qu'en 1992, année de base de l'étude des coûts économiques réalisée par le CCLAT, 6 701 
Canadiens sont décédés par suite de la consommation d'alcool. Ces décès comptaient une bonne part de 
personnes relativement jeunes. Le nombre des années de vie potentielles perdues a été évalué à 186 257, 
ce qui représente 27,8 années de vie perdues pour chaque décès lié à l'alcool.
<LI>Les 6 701 décès attribués à l'alcool par l'étude du CCLAT représentaient 3 % de tous les décès 
enregistrés au Canada en 1992; les 186 257 années de vie potentielle perdues à cause de l'alcool, 6 % du 
nombre total des années de vie potentielle perdues; les 86 076 hospitalisations dues à l'alcool, 2 % de tous 
les cas d'hospitalisation; et le 1,15 million de jours d'hospitalisation imputables à l'alcool, 3 % du nombre 
total des jours d'hospitalisation.
<LI>Selon les estimations du CCLAT, le nombre total des décès enregistrés au Canada en 1992 et 
attribuables au tabac s'élevait à 33 498. La majeure partie des décès associés au tabagisme (11 704), soit 
35 %, étaient dus à un cancer.
<LI>Les 33 498 décès imputables au tabac, selon l'étude du CCLAT, composaient 17 % de la mortalité 
totale au Canada en 1992. Le tabagisme représentait alors 16 % du nombre total des années de vie 
potentielle perdues, 6 % de tous les cas d'hospitalisation, et 7 % de tous les jours d'hospitalisation.
<LI>Le CCLAT a imputé 732 décès aux drogues illicites au Canada en 1992. Ces décès visaient en 
grande majorité (87 %) des hommes, dont la plupart étaient relativement jeunes.
<LI>La majeure partie des décès associés à la drogue étaient des cas de suicide (42 %), et 
d'empoisonnement par opiacés (14 %) ou par cocaïne (9 %). L'utilisation de seringues contaminées par les 
toxicomanes intraveineux a causé 61 décès chez les sidatiques, soit 8 % de tous les décès associés à la 
consommation des drogues illicites. La propagation du virus du sida chez les consommateurs de drogues 
illicites demeure un vecteur majeur de transmission du sida dans l'ensemble de la population.
<LI>Bien que les décès imputés aux drogues illicites soient moins nombreux que ceux causés par l'alcool 
et le tabac, les premiers frappent souvent la population des adolescents. Les 732 décès liés aux drogues 
illicites ont entraîné la perte de 31 147 années de vie potentielle, soit 42,6 années par décès, et environ 
1 % de toutes les années de vie potentielle perdues.
<LI>De manière générale, l'abus de drogues représentait 21 % de la mortalité totale au Canada en 1992, 
et 23 % des années de vie potentielle perdues; les hospitalisations dues à l'abus de ces produits, 8 % du 
nombre total des cas d'hospitalisation, et 10 % de tous les jours d'hospitalisation.
</UL>
<H2><A NAME = 
economic></A>Coûts économiques</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Le CCLAT estime que l'abus des drogues, en 1992, a coûté plus de 18,4 milliards de dollars à 
l'économie canadienne, soit 649 $ par habitant, ou quelque 2,7 % du produit national brut.
<LI>L'alcool a coûté quelque 7,5 milliards de dollars, ou 265 dollars par habitant; le tabagisme 
9,5 milliards de dollars, ou environ 340 dollars par habitant; et les drogues illicites, plus de 1,4 milliard 
de dollars, ou environ 48 dollars par habitant.
</UL>
En examinant les résultats de l'étude des coûts économiques réalisée par le 
CCLAT, il convient de garder à l'esprit deux grands facteurs.<P>
Tout d'abord, précisons qu'il s'agit d'une étude extrêmement conservatrice, 
mesurant seulement ceux des méfaits susceptibles d'être clairement liés à 
l'abus des drogues. On a par exemple argué qu'une part des délits contre les 
biens (c.-à-d. le vol) pouvait être imputée aux drogues illicites, mais nous 
n'avons malheureusement pu trouver aucune étude qui établisse cette part.<P>
En deuxième lieu, il semble, rétrospectivement, que la consommation de 
drogues en 1992 avait atteint le plus bas niveau enregistré depuis la fin des 
années 70 et le début des années 80. Nous savons aujourd'hui que cette 
régression a été suivie par une remontée entre 1993 et 1995. L'année 1992 
nous fournit donc le tableau le plus optimiste qui soit de la consommation de la 
drogue au Canada. Une même étude réalisée en 1996 révélerait sans doute un 
tableau nettement plus sombre.<P>
<CENTER><H1><A NAME =

drogues</H1></CENTER>
<H2><A NAME = 
public></A>Politiques publiques</H2>
<H3>L'alcool</H3>
La responsabilité de la politique canadienne en matière d'alcool est aujourd'hui 
partagée par les juridictions fédérale, provinciale et territoriale. Le 
gouvernement du Canada a pour sa part autorité sur l'importation et 
l'exportation des produits d'alcool, sur les taxes d'accise, et sur la radiodiffusion 
des publicités. Le règlement de la radiodiffusion, élaboré par le Conseil de la 
radiodiffusion et des télécommunications canadiennes (CRTC) et couramment 
appelé le «Code», interdit un large éventail de messages, notamment tout 
message<P>
<UL>
<LI>qui tente d'influencer les non-buveurs à consommer de l'alcool,
<LI>qui attire les mineurs,
<LI>qui associe la consommation d'alcool à des activités à risque élevé,
<LI>qui associe par sous-entendement la consommation d'alcool à la réussite
<LI>qui contrevient aux lois provinciales de diffusion pertinentes.
</UL>
Dans un avis public émis en août 1996, le CRTC a proposé un nouveau cadre 
de réglementation transférant la responsabilité du Code à l'industrie de la 
radiodiffusion. Cette responsabilité engloberait l'autorisation préalable des 
publicités relevant antérieurement du CRTC. Or, le Centre canadien de lutte 
contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies a pressé le CRTC de ne pas se départir 
de cette responsabilité d'assurer le respect de son propre Code et de préciser 
quel mécanisme il comptait intégrer au nouveau cadre de réglementation pour 
garantir cette conformité.<P>
Dans le même avis, le CRTC a affirmé qu'il s'attendait à ce que les 
radiodiffuseurs présentent une vision équilibrée de la consommation de l'alcool 
dans notre société en transmettant des messages de sensibilisation aux 
dangers de la consommation l'alcool. Il n'existe toutefois aucun règlement 
spécifiant le ratio de contre-publicité à diffuser, ni aucune définition de ce que 
constitue une vision équilibrée de la consommation d'alcool. Le CCLAT a 
recommandé que le CRTC invite les représentants de la santé publique à 
participer au projet d'examen annuel des initiatives de contre-publicité.<P>
<H3>Le tabac</H3>
Deux développements majeurs de la politique sur le tabac survenus depuis 
1994 ont miné l'action visant à convaincre les jeunes Canadiens de s'abstenir 
de fumer. Le premier a été la diminution des taxes sur le tabac effectuée par le 
gouvernement fédéral afin de neutraliser le grave problème de la contrebande 
des cigarettes. Le second a été une décision de la Cour suprême, en 
septembre 1995, qui retirait de la Loi réglementant les produits du tabac 
certaines dispositions interdisant la publicité de la cigarette.<P>
Le Canada a désespérément besoin d'une nouvelle initiative audacieuse pour 
combler les lacunes de l'actuelle politique sur le tabac. Le gouvernement du 
Canada détient certes un puissant outil en celui de la taxation, mais il voudra de 
toute évidence éviter une majoration des prix susceptible d'engendrer une 
reprise de la contrebande. Il pourrait sans doute imposer des taxes plus 
élevées, mais en prenant soin d'ouvrir des négociations avec Washington pour 
éliminer l'écart entre les prix canadiens et les prix américains. Il pourrait aussi 
envisager de recourir à une police spécialisée. Mais en fin de compte, toute 
mesure visant à réduire l'approvisionnement en tabac, voire même celui de 
l'alcool et des drogues illicites, demeurera à peu près nulle, si nous ne 
parvenons pas parallèlement, par des programmes efficaces de sensibilisation 
et de prévention, à réduire la demande.<P>
<H3>Les drogues illicites</H3>
Le Comité devrait déjà, à cette étape, bien connaître le projet de loi C-8, soit la 
Loi réglementant certaines drogues et autres substances. En effet, le processus 
d'examen auquel nous participons ici a d'ailleurs été recommandé par le Sous-
comité chargé de l'étude du projet de loi. De toute évidence, le Sous-comité 
croyait en la pertinence d'examiner cette nouvelle loi sur les droguesla 
première en plus de trente ansdans le contexte global de l'action canadienne 
antidrogue. Le CCLAT endosse totalement ce point de vue.<P>
Le CCLAT a déjà exposé, il y a deux ans, son opinion sur le nouveau projet de 
loi, qui était alors désigné projet de loi C-7. Il peut être utile ici de répéter 
certaines des observations que nous avions alors formulées, même s'il n'est 
plus possible de modifier le projet de loi C-8.<P>
Le CCLAT avait demandé que la loi porte en avant-propos un clair énoncé 
d'intention, dans la même optique que la demande du Sous-comité visant à 
mettre la loi en contexte. Un tel énoncé aurait pu aider les Canadiens à mieux 
saisir pourquoi le ministère de la Santé a jugé opportun de parrainer une loi qui 
porte essentiellement sur les pouvoirs de la police, l'exécution des lois et les 
sanctions.<P>
Le CCLAT avait aussi fait valoir que le projet de loi ne s'inspirait pas 
suffisamment des alternatives de traitement prévues par les conventions des 
Nations Unies en matière de drogues en remplacement de la prison. C'est donc 
avec bonheur que nous avons constaté l'adoption du projet de loi C-41, qui 
prévoit la possibilité des sanctions alternatives pour un large éventail de délits, 
aussi espérons-nous que les tribunaux sauront rapprocher les deux textes.<P>
Nous désirons ici faire part d'une mise en garde adressée par nos collègues du 
secteur du traitement, à savoir que même s'ils appuient fermement l'idée de 
remplacer les peines de prison par des services de traitement, leurs ressources 
sont devenues si ténues, pour ne pas dire inexistantes, qu'il serait impossible 
de répondre à un accroissement de la demande venant du régime judiciaire, 
sans une réaffectation préalable des ressources. Les fonds qu'il serait possible 
de récupérer en s'attaquant au syndrome de récidive qui entrave actuellement 
la bonne marche du régime judiciaire devrait plus que suffire à couvrir les coûts 
additionnels de traitement.<P>

<H3>La santé de la population : de quoi s'agit-il?</H3>
Au Canada, l'accent accordé aux programmes de lutte contre l'abus des 
drogues et de l'alcool a considérablement diminué au cours des récentes 
années, en raison des compressions budgétaires et de la nouvelle orientation 
des politiques. Au palier provincial et territorial, la majeure partie des 
organismes autonomes de lutte antidrogue ont été démantelés, et leurs services 
de prévention, de sensibilisation et de traitement intégrés dans le régime 
provincial des soins de santé. Cette situation a entraîné l'érosion des 
connaissances spécialisées et de l'expertise, de même que la perte d'un 
personnel hautement qualifié.<P>
Sur le plan fédéral, les éléments restants des programmes de santé développés 
dans le cadre de la Stratégie canadienne antidrogue seront fondus dans un 
vaste éventail d'autres intérêts, sous l'étiquette «santé de la population». On 
ignore encore quelle priorité Santé Canada accordera au dossier de la 
toxicomanie dans ce nouveau cadre de travail, ni quels genres de programmes 
seront mis sur pied.<P>
La santé de la population, ou «modèle des déterminants de la santé», 
correspond à un concept introduit au Canada il y a plus de vingt ans, par 
l'ancien ministre de la Santé, Marc Lalonde. Il s'agissait à l'origined'une formule 
attrayante puisqu'elle considèrait la santé dans une approche holistique et 
enseignait que l'on pouvait améliorer sa santé en faisant des choix de mode de 
vie sensés. Aujourd'hui, elle présente l'avantage de paraître extrêmement 
rentable puisqu'elle suggère que l'accès à des services médicaux de pointe 
coûteux a somme toute peu d'impact véritable sur notre santé globale.<P>
Dans la pratique cependant, le principe de la santé de la population pose une 
énigme. La documentation sur la santé de la population nous apprend par 
exemple que la situation professionnelle d'une personne a un impact certain sur 
la santé de cette dernière. Plus le travailleur progresse dans la hiérarchie d'une 
entreprise, moins il éprouve de problèmes de santé. Alors, quels genres de 
programmes devons-nous concevoir pour corriger une telle situation. Faut-il 
accorder à chacun une promotion? Une importante étude réalisée au Royaume-
Uni il y a quelques années a permis de constater que le fait d'avoir accès à une 
automobile avait une influence sur la santé des citoyens de Londres. Sommes-
nous véritablement prêts à affronter les implications du concept de la santé de 
la population?<P>
La santé de la population englobe une gamme complète de déterminants 
susceptibles ou non de s'inscrire dans le contexte de santé traditionnel. Tout 
cela est compréhensible. Il se peut que l'abus de drogues ne soit pas une cause 
d'affection, mais seulement un symptôme. Les véritables déterminants peuvent 
être d'ordre social, économique ou biologique, ou de plusieurs ordres à la fois, 
ou découler de nombreuses autres causes profondes. Il y aurait lieu de tenir 
compte de ces antécédents, quoique qu'il faille encore déterminer comment 
procéder. Cependant, il nous faudra toujours continuer de traiter les problèmes 
de toxicomaniesymptôme ou autreselon un mode précis et ciblé.<P>
Le CCLAT estime que l'abus de drogues est à la fois un catalyseur de mauvaise 
santé et un inhibiteur de la réussite des programmes de santé et de services 
sociaux. En fait, le concept de la santé de la population ne sera viable que dans 
un environnement fondé sur la reconnaissance simultanée de ces deux 
thèses.<P>
Plus tôt dans le présent mémoire, nous soulignions l'absence d'objectifs 
mesurables dans la Stratégie canadienne antidrogue et l'utilité d'un mécanisme 
pour procéder à une telle évaluation. L'établissement des objectifs et 
l'évaluation de ces derniers formera un processus nettement plus complexe 
dans le cadre de la santé de la population. Ici encore, nous attendons avec 
impatience de savoir comment l'on compte procéder.<P>
Nous croyons que le CCLAT pourrait aider les responsables de programmes et 
les décideurs à concrétiser le concept de la santé de la population. La capacité 
d'aborder la santé des différents groupes de la population dépendra largement 
du genre de données détaillées qu'il sera possible de rassembler pour chaque 
groupe et de la façon dont chacun réagit aux divers agents de stress sanitaires 
et sociaux. En d'autres termes, l'application du concept de la santé de la 
population est étroitement liée à l'épidémiologie. Or, le Réseau communautaire 
canadien de l'épidémiologie des toxicomanies (RCCET), qui suit actuellement 
les tendances de consommation de la drogue dans six villes canadiennes, peut 
fournir une profusion d'informations à l'appui de sa mise en application.<P>
S'il est correctement implanté, le concept de la santé de la population pourrait 
nous permettre de considérer les toxicomanies selon une approche plus 
holistique. Par exemple, le CCLAT est de plus en plus pressé d'exercer le rôle 
de fournisseur national d'information sur le problème de l'obsession au jeu 
(gambling). Même si nous avons commencé, par l'intermédiaire du Centre 
national de documentation sur l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies, à rassembler 
des données sur ce problème, nous demeurons limités dans notre action du fait 
que cette tâche ne soit pas expressément incluse dans notre mission. Il existe 
donc ici une demande réelle que le CCLAT pourrait remplir s'il était doté du 
pouvoir de s'adapter à la demande.<P>
<CENTER><H1><A NAME = 
internat></A>Considerations internationales</H1></CENTER>
Le Canada n'est pas seul à lutter contre l'abus des drogues. Les Etats-Unis 
sont aussi aux prises avec le même phénomène, et les tendances à la hausse y 
frappent les mêmes populations, soit les adolescents et les jeunes adultes. 
L'administration Clinton a réagi en engageant le pays dans une stratégie 
antidrogue de dix ans qui mettra le cap cette fois sur la réduction de la 
demande. Le président Clinton a déjà annoncé l'octroi de plus de 15 milliards de 
dollars pour la première année seulement.<P>
Le trafic de la drogue et le blanchiment de fonds représentent des entreprises 
mondiales absolument colossales, et aucun pays ne peut affronter isolément les 
problèmes qui en découlent. Des événements qui surviennent sur l'autre face 
du globe ont normalement des répercussions immédiates et dévastatrices dans 
les rues de nos villes et villages. Chaque fois que la pureté de l'héroïne 
augmente, des citoyens meurent. Chaque fois que les prix baissent, des 
citoyens meurent. Chaque fois que les transactions de drogues tournent au 
vinaigre, des citoyens meurent.<P>
Le libre-échange mondial des biens légitimes a aussi ouvert la voie au trafic de 
la drogue. Le crime organisé a assis sa suprématie dans de nombreux pays où 
l'économie légitime menace de s'effondrer. Certaines nations de l'ancienne 
Union soviétique, aujourd'hui à la dérive, sont devenues des avenues ouvertes 
au trafic de la drogue. Il est par ailleurs admis qu'au fur et à mesure que la 
drogue pénètre le marché, les pays de transit deviennent eux aussi des pays 
consommateurs. A ce propos, certains membres du Comité seront sans doute 
surpris d'apprendre que le Canada est un pays de transit.<P>
Les drogues licites constituent également un problème international. De 
nombreux pays où la consommation d'alcool atteint des niveaux dangereux 
n'ont d'autres options que d'adopter des mesures répressives telles la 
prohibition. L'Union soviétique a tenté cette solution, mais avec des résultats 
catastrophiques.<P>
La consommation du tabac augmente, spécialement dans les pays du Tiers-
monde et parmi les nouvelles nations du bloc soviétique, où les fabricants de 
tabac ont beau jeu d'y exploiter la demande vorace pour leurs produits, 
demande qui ne trouve plus sa place en Amérique du Nord. Dans ces pays, on 
ne retrouve pas les mises en garde de Santé Canada sur les paquets de 
cigarette, pas plus que l'on y retrouve  d'ailleurs une conscientisation profonde 
aux effets néfastes du tabagisme.<P>
La conjugaison de la science et de l'ère de l'information fait aujourd'hui planer 
une nouvelle menace relativement à la drogue. On constate en effet la 
promotion sur Internet de puissants stimulants synthétiques, ainsi que la 
diffusion de recettes de fabrication toutes simples que quiconque peut 
facilement exécuter n'importe où.<P>
Les Nations Unies considèrent toujours la lutte antidrogue comme l'une des 
grandes priorités, et ce, au même titre que le terrorisme, le maintien de la paix 
et l'environnement. L'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies se réunira en 
séance extraordinaire, en juin 1998, pour débattre du fléau de la drogue. Il est 
impérieux que le Canada soit fortement représenté à cette réunion.<P>
<CENTER><H1><A NAME = 
issues></A>Questions et solutions</H1></CENTER>
<H2><A NAME = 
right></A>La politique antidrogue : sommes-nous à 
l'heure?</H2>
Le Canada doit-il «se montrer plus dur» en matière de drogues et adopter 
l'approche américaine de tolérance zéro, ou devrait-il plutôt reconnaître que la 
consommation de certaines drogues est un fait normal de société comme les 
Hollandais l'ont fait, par exemple? Il est tentant d'affronter le problème en 
adoptant une vision de part et d'autre aussi clairement tranchée, mais cela dit, 
le Canada se doit de trouver des solutions judicieuses et novatrices qui 
correspondent véritablement aux valeurs canadiennes.<P>
Certaines vérités s'imposent d'elles-mêmes. Est-il nécessaire, comme société, 
d'ouvrir l'accès à un plus grand nombre de substances psychotropes? Est-il 
réellement nécessaire de légaliser la marijuana, par exemple? Notre société est 
déjà inondée de drogues, tant licites qu'illicites. Les graves répercussions de 
l'alcool et du tabac ne suffisent-elles pas à nous décourager de faciliter l'accès 
à d'autres intoxicants? N'avons-nous pas tendance à nous rabattre trop 
rapidement sur des solutions chimiques afin de résoudre des problèmes qui 
menacent de nous dépasser tous?<P>
D'un autre côtéet c'est là une véritable ironienous avons tendance à 
stigmatiser les personnes qui ont le malheur de devenir dépendantes des 
drogues, et lorsqu'il s'agit de drogues illicites, nous les pénalisons souvent, ne 
faisant qu'aggraver ainsi le mal qu'elles s'infligent déjà.<P>
En règle générale, les discussions sur la politique antidrogue se polarisent en 
faveur, d'une part, de la prohibition et, d'autre part, de la décriminalisation ou de 
la légalisation. Les partisans de la prohibition soutiennent qu'une libéralisation 
des drogues conduira à la hausse dramatique de la consommation. Leurs 
opposants croient au contraire que la décriminalisation ou la légalisation réglera 
de nombreux problèmes liés à la drogue, soit en éliminant le motif du profit du 
trafic. Or, à notre connaissance, il n'existe aucun élément concret qui permette 
de corroborer l'une ou l'autre des deux thèses.<P>
Le débat sur la prohibition et la légalisation provoque des articles de journaux 
fort intéressants, mais nous distrait de la véritable question, à savoir qu'aucun 
rafistolage des mécanismes d'exécution de la loi régissant les drogues et de 
réduction de l'approvisionnement ne peut être aussi efficace qu'une stratégie 
nationale musclée de réduction de la demande, qui se fonde sur la prévention, 
la sensibilisation, le traitement et la réadaptation.<P>
<H2><A NAME = 
focus></A>Accent sur les jeunes et les groupes 
particulièrement vulnérables</H2>
Dans son rapport de 1987, intitulé «Boisson, pilules et drogue : comment 
réduire leur consommation au Canada», le Comité permanent de la santé 
nationale et du bien-être social recommandait que le ministère de la Santé 
nationale et du bien-être social classe les enfants et les jeunes à la tête des 
priorités de financement à coûts partagés du programme de prévention contre 
la drogue. Cette recommandation a été formulée à une période où la 
consommation de drogues chez les jeunes accusait une régression, après avoir 
atteint des sommets à la fin des années 70 et au début des années 80. Elle 
était néanmoins valable, et il convient aujourd'hui de la réitérer, et ce, d'autant 
plus vivement que les taux de consommation progressent rapidement.<P>
Nous avons beaucoup appris durant la récente décennie sur la façon dont nous 
pouvons, par des messages de prévention crédibles, atteindre les jeunes. Nous 
apprenons à être plus honnêtes et pragmatiques. Aussi, est-il important, au 
moment où nous abordons une période marquée par la croissance de la 
drogue, d'élargir notre savoir. Notre plus grosse faute est d'avoir manqué de 
constance. Nous avons laissé les campagnes de prévention et de 
sensibilisation se faire et se défaire au fil des intérêts politiques, et le 
financement descendre et monter, comme les marées. Nous devons trouver 
comment intégrer ces activités dans nos programmes, sans qu'il nous en coûte 
les yeux de la tête, et les appuyer en permanence. <P>
En ce qui concerne les politiques et les programmes s'adressant aux jeunes, il 
convient de les tailler sur mesure, de manière à répondre aux besoins 
spécifiques de chaque sous-groupe de cette population, y compris les jeunes 
de la rue, peu faciles à joindre. Les programmes doivent devenir partie 
intégrante du milieu d'évolution et d'apprentissage des jeunes, notamment 
l'école, la famille, les amis et la communauté.<P>
<H3>Une stragégie-clé : fortifier la résistance des 
jeunes</H3>
Au cours des récentes années, nous avons appris à mieux apprécier le rôle des 
facteurs de protection dans la prévention de l'abus de drogues chez les jeunes. 
Nous avons ainsi découvert que les enfants et les adolescents ont plus de 
chance de résister à l'attrait de la drogue s'ils ont accès à une importante 
source de soutien social, soit-elle un enseignant sympathique, un membre de la 
famille, ou un membre de la communauté. Tout ce que ça prend, c'est une 
personne spéciale, un conseiller, pour apporter au jeune le soutien dont il a 
besoin et, de façon tout aussi importante, lui exprimer les attentes élevées que 
l'on a à son endroit.<P>
<H3>Le SAF et les mises en garde</H3>
La diminution des ressources nous oblige à repenser les campagnes destinées 
au grand public et à les orienter plutôt vers les jeunes et les autres groupes à 
risque élevé, tels les Autochtones, les femmes enceintes, les handicapés et les 
aînés. Le CCLAT a oeuvré dans tous ces secteurs, mais l'une des plus grandes 
préoccupations à ce jour porte sur le problème des dommages causés au 
foetus chez les femmes qui consomment de l'alcool durant la grossesse. Le 
Centre exploite un service national d'information sur le syndrome d'alcoolisme 
foetal et sur les effets de l'alcoolisme foetal, ceci en partenariat avec Santé 
Canada et l'Association des brasseurs du Canada.<P>
Nous soulevons cette question dans le but d'attirer de nouveau l'attention sur le 
ferme appui que nous recevons des intervenants en SAF/EAF pour l'apposition 
de mises en garde sur les contenants d'alcool. Nous rappelons au Comité que 
le CCLAT a déjà appuyé cette demande lors de sa soumission au Sous-comité 
chargé d'étudier le projet de loi C-222, en avril. Nous avions alors souligné que 
les mises en garde et les autres mesures isolées n'auront que peu d'effet, voire 
aucun, à moins qu'elles ne s'insèrent dans une stratégie globale visant à réduire 
les nombreux risques élevés qui menacent les femmes qui font une 
consommation excessive d'alcool durant la grossesse, ainsi que leur foetus.<P>
<H2><A NAME = 
continuum></A>Continuum d'interventions rentables</H2>
<H3>Abstinence ou maîtrise de la consommation</H3>
Tel les échanges sur la prohibition et la décriminalisation, les discussions sur 
l'abstinence et la maîtrise de la consommation ne manquent jamais de soulever 
les passions. Un énorme débat sur le traitement de l'alcoolisme a été amorcé, il 
y a plus de trente ans, lorsqu'un médecin britannique a déclaré avoir traité 
plusieurs alcooliques lourds, qui sont par la suite devenus des «buveurs 
mondains» modérés. Les partisans de la thèse de l'abstinence (popularisée par 
les Alcooliques anonymes) et selon laquelle un alcoolique ne peut apprendre à 
consommer avec modération, n'ont pas hésité à attaquer le médecin et son 
oeuvre.<P>
Un débat analogue a maintes fois été tenu sur la pertinence d'entretenir les 
héroïnomanes au moyen d'ordonnances médicales de méthadone, voire même 
d'héroïne dans certains pays. Les opinions sont tout aussi partagées quant au 
bien-fondé d'approvisionner les toxicomanes en seringues stériles dans le but 
de freiner la propagation du virus du sida.<P>
Le CCLAT estime que la polarisation de ces questions est contre-productive. 
Aucune solution ne peut suffire seule à résoudre chaque problème de drogue. 
Les gens diffèrent, les situations évoluent. En ce qui concerne l'alcool, nous 
savons que de 5 à 10 % de la population sont potentiellement des buveurs 
lourds. Pour eux, l'abstinence est de toute évidence le meilleur choix.<P>
<H3>Abstinence ou réduction des méfaits</H3>
Cependant, un autre 15 à 20 % de la population éprouvent des problèmes 
occasionnels de consommation qui peuvent aller d'une absence du travail d'une 
journée pour soigner une gueule de bois à un grave accident automobile. Bon 
nombre de ces personnes font partie des buveurs modérés, sauf qu'à 
l'occasion, ils consomment trop. Ces buveurs peuvent refuser l'abstinence 
comme étant la meilleure solution. Nos programmes et nos politiques doivent 
tenir compte de cette réalité et tenter de mieux cibler la véritable source du mal
non pas le fait de boire en soi, mais plutôt celui de boire avec excès, ou 
abusivement. Nous nous attachons ainsi à «réduire les méfaits».<P>
Le principe de la réduction des méfaits devient plus délicat lorsqu'il s'applique 
aux drogues illicites. La majorité des Canadiens appuient les programmes de 
distribution de méthadone et de seringues, mais dans des limites très 
restreintes seulement. Comment ressentons-nous, par exemple, l'idée de 
distribuer des seringues stériles en prison dans le but de stopper la propagation 
du virus du sida? Comment réagissons-nous à la proposition du coroner de la 
Colombie-Britannique, de prescrire de l'héroïne aux héroïnomanes, sous 
contrôle médical, en vue de freiner la croissance effarante des cas de surdoses 
mortelles dans les rues de Vancouver?<P>
<H2><A NAME = 
supporting></A>Processus décisionnel fondé sur une 
information étayée</H2>
Il n'est pas facile de répondre à ces questions, qui mettent d'ailleurs à l'épreuve 
les valeurs de notre société. Lorsque nous regardons au-delà des aspects 
émotionnels, force nous est de constater le besoin d'assurer la prise de 
décisions rationnelles, fondées sur une information solidement étayée. Il y a 
lieu, dans un premier temps, de procéder à une évaluation honnête de tous les 
méfaits associés au problème de la drogue, puis de les classer par ordre de 
priorité. Il convient ensuite de s'efforcer de gérer les risques les plus importants 
en premier, au moyen des stratégies pertinentes.<P>
Pour ce qui est du mode d'intervention, celui de la réduction des méfaits a 
contribué à mieux cibler l'action là où elle semblait la plus urgente. Ce mode 
s'est par contre révélé moins valable en ce qui concerne l'évaluation de ses 
résultats et la démonstration de ses avantages. Ce n'est pas là tâche facile. 
Même si les données rassemblées sont détaillées, elles ne sont pas toujours 
correctement interprétées.<P>
Plus tôt cette année, par exemple, le Globe and Mail a publié un article sur un 
programme d'échange de seringues à Montréal qui avait, semble-t-il, contribué 
à propager le virus du sida. Le journaliste avait consulté le rapport d'étude d'un 
programme qui indiquait un taux plus élevé d'infection au VIH chez les 
consommateurs de drogues participant au programme que chez les 
toxicomanes intraveineux non participants. En vérifiant l'information auprès du 
médecin responsable de l'étude, à Montréal, le CCLAT a découvert que le taux 
supérieur d'infection chez les participants au programme s'expliquait par le fait 
qu'une large part d'entre eux s'étaient inscrits alors qu'ils étaient déjà 
contaminés par le virus. En fait, le rapport concluait en précisant que l'échange 
de seringues avait réduit l'incidence du VIH.<P>
<H2><A NAME = 
enhancing></A>Accroissement de la participation du 
secteur privé et de la communauté</H2>
Au cours des récentes années, le secteur privé a démontré un vif intérêt envers 
les intervenants en toxicomanie. Confrontés au risque de perdre leurs sources 
de financement, de nombreux organismes ont sollicité le parrainage et le 
soutien des entreprises et des industries pour maintenir leurs activités. Le 
CCLAT a ainsi trouvé certains appuis financiers, en particulier pour son service 
d'information sur le SAF/EAF. A ce propos, nous croyons utile de rappeler qu'il 
serait irréaliste, au Canada, de penser pouvoir mener l'action antidrogue en 
comptant pour une bonne part sur la générosité du secteur commercial et 
industriel, à moins bien sûr que le gouvernement ne prévoit des incitatifs 
novateurspeut-être fiscauxafin de susciter une meilleure participation du 
secteur privé. Nous encourageons vivement l'adoption de telles stratégies.<P>
Le secteur privé pourrait raisonnablement nous fournir une aide dans des 
domaines où nous pourrions, de notre côté, le seconder. Il existe un besoin 
évident d'orientation et d'experts-conseils dans ces domaines. Une majorité de 
gestionnaires et de cadres supérieurs considèrent l'abus de drogues chez les 
employés comme un grave problème, et pourtant de nombreuses entreprises 
ne disposent pas des ressources nécessaires pour y faire face. Pendant que les 
programmes d'aide aux employés ne cessent de se multiplier, le dépistage de la 
drogue chez les employés a soulevé de fortes controverses et donné lieu à 
plusieurs appels devant les tribunaux des droits de la personne. Aussi, de 
nombreux propriétaires, surtout de petites et de moyennes entreprises, 
cherchent une source susceptible de les informer.<P>
Le Canada ne se comporte pas aussi bien qu'il serait permis de le souhaiter en 
ce qui concerne la drogue et le milieu de travail. Selon le Rapport de 1995 sur la 
compétitivité mondiale, le Canada se classait 12e parmi 48 pays sur le plan de 
la compétitivité globale, mais tombait aussi bas qu'au 40e rang pour ce qui est 
de l'action antidrogue en milieu de travail.<P>
Le CCLAT a tenté de pallier le manque de connaissances marquant l'abus de 
drogues en milieu de travail par la publication de divers documents d'information 
spécialisée, notamment le premier répertoire des programmes et services d'aide 
aux employés au Canada. Le Centre a développé conjointement avec la GRC 
diverses publications et présentations dont les agents de sensibilisation 
antidrogue peuvent faire profiter le milieu de travail. Le Centre a en outre tenu 
une série de colloques téléphoniques sur le milieu de travail consacrés à la 
discussion de questions cruciales telles la nouvelle réglementation américaine 
sur le transport, qui oblige les chauffeurs de véhicules commerciaux entrant aux 
Etats-Unis à subir un test de dépistage de drogues.<P>
<H3>Comment susciter la participation 
communautaire</H3>
La politique et l'action antidrogue ne peuvent réussir sans la participation de la 
communauté. Certes, les programmes d'envergure nationale sont rentables du 
fait de leur vaste clientèle, mais ils doivent demeurer suffisamment souples pour 
répondre aux besoins de chaque population et de chaque environnement. 
Seule une contribution acharnée de la part des communautés individuelles 
permettra des stratégies valables. Aussi, seul un mécanisme de communication 
national efficace permettra d'assurer une telle contribution.<P>
Le processus de développement communautaire consiste en partie, surtout 
dans le nouveau cadre conceptuel de la santé de la population, à trouver les 
moyens de susciter la participation des groupes dits non traditionnels qui 
normalement, à l'instar du secteur privé, ne se considéraient pas touchés par 
les stratégies antidrogue. Nous pensons notamment aux groupes et particuliers 
préoccupés par le logement, le chômage et la pauvreté. Même les groupes dont 
le principal intérêt est d'ordre financier doivent participer. Il convient de créer 
des incitatifs afin de gagner la participation de ces groupes à l'action 
commune.<P>

une approche plus holistique. Par exemple, le CCLAT est de plus en plus pressé d'exercer le rôle de 
fournisseur national d'information sur le problème de l'obsession au jeu (gambling). Il existe donc ici une 
demande réelle que le CCLAT pourrait remplir s'il était doté du pouvoir de s'adapter à la demande.
</UL>
<H3>Des méchanismes d'exécution de la loi</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Le débat sur la prohibition et la légalisation nous distrait de la véritable question, à savoir qu'aucun 
rafistolage des mécanismes d'exécution de la loi régissant les drogues et de réduction de 
l'approvisionnement ne peut être aussi efficace qu'une stratégie nationale musclée de réduction de la 
demande, qui se fonde sur la prévention, la sensibilisation, le traitement et la réadaptation.
</UL>
<H3>La réduction des méfaits</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Pour ce qui est du mode d'intervention, celui de la réduction des méfaits a contribué à mieux cibler 
l'action là où elle semblait la plus urgente. Ce mode s'est par contre révélé moins valable en ce qui 
concerne l'évaluation de ses résultats et la démonstration de ses avantages.
<LI>Les programmes et les politiques de prévention et de sensibilisation en matière d'alcool doivent tenir 
compte du fait que la solution de l'abstinence ne convient pas à tous, et leurs concepteurs doivent s'efforcer 
de mieux cibler la véritable source du malnon pas le fait de boire, mais celui de boire avec excès, ou de 
manière abusive.
</UL>
<H3>Les publicités en faveur des boissons 
alcoolisées</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Le Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies a pressé le CRTC de ne pas se 
départir de sa responsabilité d'assurer le respect de son propre Code de la publicité radiodiffusée en faveur 
de boissons alcoolisées et de préciser quel mécanisme il comptait intégrer au nouveau cadre de 
réglementation pour assurer la conformité au Code. Le CCLAT a recommandé que le CRTC invite les 
représentants de la santé publique à participer au projet d'examen annuel des initiatives de contre-publicité 
afin d'assurer la diffusion par les médias de messages équilibrés.
</UL>
<H3>Les alternatives de pénalisation et le traitement</H3>
<UL>
<LI>La création d'un nouvel influx de cas de traitement soumis par le régime judiciaire, par suite de 
l'imposition de peines alternatives, devra nécessairement s'accompagner d'une réaffectation des ressources. 
Les fonds qu'il serait possible de récupérer en s'attaquant au syndrome de récidive qui entrave 
actuellement le bon déroulement du processus judiciaire devrait plus que suffire à couvrir les coûts 
additionnels de traitement.
</UL>
<H3>Les mises en garde sur les contenants des boissons 
alcoolisées</H3>
<UL>
<LI>L'apposition de mises en garde sur les contenants des boissons alcoolisées et toute autre mesure isolée 
n'auront que peu d'effet, voire aucun, à moins qu'elles ne s'insèrent dans une stratégie globale visant à 
réduire les nombreux risques élevés qui menacent les femmes qui font une consommation excessive 
d'alcool durant la grossesse, ainsi que le développement de leurs foetus.
</UL>
<H3>La participation des collectivités</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Le processus de développement communautaire consiste en partie, surtout au sein de la nouvelle 
structuration du programme de santé de la population, à trouver les moyens de susciter la participation des 
groupes dits non traditionnels qui habituellement, à l'instar du secteur privé, ne se considéraient pas 
touchés par les stratégies antidrogue. Nous pensons notamment aux groupes et particuliers préoccupés par 
le logement, le chômage et la pauvreté.
</UL>
<H3>L'information</H3>
<UL>
<LI>L'efficacité des programmes et des politiques de lutte antidrogue dépend de la qualité de 
l'information sur laquelle ils s'appuient. Il convient de mettre en place des mécanismes et des 
infrastructures pour rassembler et diffuser les données et l'information de manière à fonder le processus 
décisionnel sur une information étayée.

</HEAD><BODY>
<H3>Profil canadien 1996</H3>
<H1>La criminalité reliée à la drogue au 
Canada</H1>
<I><H4>par Bob Williams, Minh Van Truong and Gary 
Timoshenko, Fondation de la recherche sur la 
toxicomanie</H4></I>
<HR>
<H3>Points saillants</H3>
<UL>
<LI>En 1993, on a relevé, au Canada, 194 916 infractions aux lois sur les boissons alcooliques, 
représentant 63 % des infractions déclarées en vertu des lois provinciales (sauf les infractions au code de 
la route).
<LI>En 1993, on a dénombré 117 567 infractions fédérales pour conduite avec facultés affaiblies. Leur 
nombre a généralement régressé depuis 1983. Le taux par 100 000 habitants de 16 et plus a baissé en 
moyenne de 4,6 % par année de 1984 à 1993.
<LI>En 1993, on a enregistré 56 811 infractions liées à la drogue, soit 0,6 % de plus seulement que 
l'année précédente. De ces infractions, 63 % étaient reliées au cannabis et 22 % à la cocaïne.
</UL>

<HR>
<H2>Sources d'information</H2>
Ce chapitre traite des infractions aux lois provinciales sur les boissons alcooliques, des infractions 
aux lois fédérales régissant la conduite avec facultés affaiblies et des infractions fédérales en 
matière de drogue relevant de la <I>Loi sur les stupéfiants</I> et de la <I>Loi sur les aliments et 
drogues</I>. Pour une description des lois, des genres d'infractions et des peines connexes, se 
reporter au Chapitre 11.<P>
Les données exposées dans le présent chapitre s'appuient principalement sur les infractions et les 
accusations déclarées par la police dans le cadre du Programme de déclaration uniforme de la 
criminalité (DUC). Les données des «infractions» correspondent au compte des infractions légales 
identifiées, tandis que celles des «accusations» correspondent au nombre de personnes réellement 
accusées relativement aux infractions. En règle générale, lorsqu'une personne est accusée de 
plusieurs infractions, seule l'infraction ou l'accusation la plus grave est déclarée. Cette mesure 
donne lieu à un nombre d'accusations inférieur à celui des infractions, ainsi qu'à la sous-déclaration 
des accusations en ce qui concerne maintes infractions moins graves.<P>
<H2>Les lois sur les boissons alcooliques</H2>
Au Canada, le contrôle et la vente des boissons alcooliques sont de compétence et d'application 
provinciales. Il convient donc de faire preuve de prudence au moment de comparer les données 
entre les provinces.<P>
En 1993, on a relevé, au Canada, 194 916 infractions aux lois sur les boissons alcooliques, 
représentant 63 % des infractions déclarées en vertu des lois provinciales (sauf les infractions au 
code de la route). Depuis 1984, le nombre global des infractions a diminué de 29 %.<P>
A l'échelle nationale, le taux des infractions aux lois sur les boissons alcooliques par 100 000 
habitants, en 1993, s'établissait à 677,9, soit un recul de 7,4 % depuis 1992. Sur le plan régional, 
ce sont les Territoires du Nord-Ouest qui ont enregistré le taux le plus élevé (4 756,8 par 100 000), 
suivis du Yukon (3 003,1) et de l'Ile-du-Prince-Edouard (2 746,0), et le Québec le taux le plus bas 
(31,3 infractions par 100 000 habitants).<P>
Le nombre des jeunes ayant contrevenu aux lois provinciales sur les boissons alcooliques a diminué 
de 13,8 %, passant à 14 329 en 1993. Il s'agissait de la sixième baisse consécutive annuelle. Celui 
des adultes est passé à 111 727 (516,0 accusations par 100 000 adultes), soit 13,3 % de moins 
qu'en 1992. La moyenne de la réduction annuelle pour la période de 1984 à 1993 est de 5,7 %. 
Pour chacune des neuf années, 90 % environ des adultes accusés étaient des hommes.<P>
En 1993-1994, on a dénombré 5 071 admissions de personnes condamnées dans les prisons 
provinciales pour adultes, pour infractions aux lois provinciales sur les boissons alcooliques. Ces 
infractions représentaient 8 % de toutes les admissions des personnes condamnées dans ces 
établissements, et de ces dernières 88 % visaient le Québec. <P>
<H2>Les infractions pour conduite avec 
facultés affaiblies</H2>
En 1993, le Canada a enregistré 117 567 infractions pour conduite avec facultés affaiblies et, de 
1984 à cette même année, a accusé une baisse moyenne de 3,3 % par année à ce chapitre. Le taux 
des infractions par 100 000 habitants de 16 ans et plus a aussi diminué, soit en moyenne de 4,6 % 
par année durant la même période. Le taux de ces infractions a sensiblement régressé dans toutes 
les régions du Canada, sauf aux Territoires du Nord-Ouest et en Saskatchewan. Les taux les plus 
élevés reviennent dans l'ordre au Yukon (2 477), aux Territoires du Nord-Ouest (1 655), à la 
Saskatchewan (1 248) et à l'Alberta (1 170), tandis que l'Ontario et le Québec continuent de 
présenter les taux les plus bas avec 335 et 414 infractions respectivement.<P>
Toujours en 1993, les infractions pour «conduite avec facultés affaiblies d'un véhicule motorisé» 
représentaient 91 % environ (107 407 infractions) de toutes les infractions pour conduite avec 
facultés affaiblies; le défaut ou le refus de fournir un échantillon d'haleine ou de sang, 7 % (8 736 
infractions); et les infractions plus graves, soit pour conduite avec facultés affaiblies d'un véhicule 
motorisé causant la mort, 0,2 % (181 infractions), et causant des lésions corporelles 1,1 % (1 243 
infractions).<P>
Cette même année, on a dénombré 92 539 accusations pour infractions au code de la route reliées à 
l'alcool, soit 413 par 100 000 habitants chez les 16 ans et plus. Pour chacune des années de la 
période de 1990 à 1993, les hommes constituaient 90 % de toutes les personnes accusées.<P>
En 1993-1994, 13 054 personnes condamnées pour conduite avec facultés affaibles ont été admises 
dans les prisons provinciales pour adultes, constituant 17 % de toutes les admissions en milieu 
carcéral. Ce nombre équivaut à 34,6 % de plus que l'année précédente, hausse surtout attribuable 
au fait que l'Ontario a alors contribué au rapport pour la première fois depuis 1990-1991.<P>
<H2>La criminalité reliée à la drogue</H2>
Il n'est pas facile d'interpréter les données statistiques de la criminalité reliées à la drogue. Comme 
le précise le document original, un changement du nombre des infractions déclarées par la police en 
matière de drogue ne signifie pas nécessairement une hausse ou une baisse correspondante de 
l'usage de drogue, mais peut simplement refléter une modification des activités policières 
(Statistique Canada, <I>Statistique de la criminalité canadienne, 1990</I>).<P>
En 1993, on a enregistré 56 811 infractions reliées à la drogue, soit 0,6 % de plus qu'en 1992 et un 
rapport de 197,6 par 100 000 habitants. Les infractions visant le cannabis constituaient  63 % de 
toutes les infractions, la cocaïne, 22 %, et l'héroïne 2,8 %, soit une hausse de 26,9 % en 1993. Les 
taux les plus élevés ont été enregistrés dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest (591,4 par 100 000), 
puis au Yukon (459,4 par 100 000) et en Colombie-Britannique (388,3 par 100 000), et le plus bas 
à Terre-Neuve (135,1 par 100 000).<P>
En 1993, le nombre des jeunes contrevenants ayant commis des infractions reliées à la drogue en 
vertu de la législation fédérale a augmenté de 30 %, pour un total de 3 426 infractions. Cette 
hausse contraste avec la période de 1986 à 1992 durant laquelle leur nombre avait diminué en 
moyenne de 7,6 % par année. Quant aux infractions commises en vertu de la <I>Loi sur les 
stupéfiants</I>, elles constituaient 82 % de toutes les infractions reliées à la drogue, le cannabis 
étant en cause dans 85,3 % des cas et dans 70,2 % de toutes les infractions reliées à la drogue 
commises en vertu des lois fédérales.<P>
Toujours en 1993, 39 424 adultes ont été accusés pour des infractions reliées à la drogue en vertu 
des lois fédérales. Le nombre des accusations par 100 000 adultes s'établissait alors à 182,1, soit 
6,4 % de moins qu'en 1992. Les territoires continuaient d'enregistrer les taux les plus élevés (611,3 
et 441,6 accusations par 100 000 adultes dans les T.-N.-O. et au Yukon respectivement), tandis 
que le taux le plus bas revenait au Nouveau-Brunswick (94,9 par 100 000 adultes). Comme c'était 
le cas pour l'alcool, la majorité des personnes accusées étaient des hommes (85,7 %). <P>
(Notons que les données sur le règlement des accusations et des condamnations proviennent du 
Bureau de la surveillance des médicaments, Santé Canada, et qu'elles n'incluent pas les 
condamnations pour les infractions visant le cannabis.<P>
Selon ces estimations préliminaires, 10 279 (72,6 %) des 14 153 accusations qui ont été réglées en 
1994 ont donné lieu à des condamnations. Plus de la moitié (62 % ou 6,376) de ces condamnations 
ont entraîné une peine d'emprisonnement, alors que 26 % firent l'objet d'amendes et 7 %, d'une 
condamnation avec sursis ou d'une peine avec probation.<P>
Les accusations en vertu de la <I>Loi sur les stupéfiants</I> ont donné lieu à 90 % de toutes les 
condamnations fédérales en matière de drogue, tandis que les condamnations visant les drogues 
contrôlées régies par la <I>Loi sur les aliments et drogues</I> ont compté pour 10 %. Quarante-
sept pour cent (47 %) de toutes les condamnations concernaient la possession; 32 %, le trafic; 
19 %, la possession pour fin de trafic; 1 %, l'obtention illégale d'ordonnances multiples; et 1 %, 
l'importation. Les hommes avaient commis 86 % de toutes les condamnations reliées à la drogue. 
Les personnes de moins de 30 ans étaient responsables de 50 % des condamnations reliées à la 
drogue, et les 30 à 39 ans, d'un autre 35 %.<P>
En 1992-1993, on a relevé 782 admissions dans les pénitenciers fédéraux pour des infractions 
reliées à la drogue, soit 6,8 % de plus que l'année précédente. Elles représentaient 14 % de toutes 
les admissions enregistrées dans les pénitenciers fédéraux.<P>
En 1994, le nombre des vols et autres pertes reliés aux drogues contrôlées régies par la <I>Loi sur 
les stupéfiants</I> et la <I>Loi sur les aliments et drogues</I> a diminué de 13 %. La majorité 
visaient les pharmacies ou les hôpitaux, représentant 90 % des pertes déclarées pour cette année. A 
l'échelle provinciale, c'est l'Ontario qui a enregistré le plus grand nombre vols et d'autres pertes 
(508 cas), soit 52 % des vols commis à travers le Canada.<P>
Le nombre des fausses ordonnances déclarées a diminué de 36 %, passant ainsi à 1 022 en 1994. 
Cette même année, 49 % de ces ordonnances concernaient la codéine.<P>

<TITLE>Profil canadien 1996: Le sida et l'usage de la drogue</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H3>Profil canadien 1996</H3>
<H1>Le sida et l'usage de la drogue</H1>
<I><H4>par Diane Riley and Diane McKenzie, Centre canadien 
de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies</H4></I>
<HR>
<H3>Points saillants</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Depuis 1977, 11 529 Canadiens environ ont développé le sida, dont 8 199 sont décédés.
<LI>Les taux de prévalence du VIH parmi les consommateurs de drogue par injection à Montréal, Québec 
et Ottawa sont déjà très élevés.
<LI>Les taux d'incidence du VIH dans certaines villes canadiennes sont parmi les plus élevés en 
Amérique du Nord.
<LI>Plus de 1 % des détenus dans les établissements pénitenciers fédéraux sont porteurs du VIH ou ont 
développé le sida. Dans certains établissements, près de 5 % de la population des détenus sont séropositifs. 
Peu de mesures ont été mises en place pour vérifier la propagation du VIH dans les prisons. 
</UL>

<HR>
<H2>Vue d'ensemble</H2>
Toute personne qui consomme de la drogue s'expose au danger d'être contaminée par le virus de 
l'immunodéficience humaine (VIH) et d'autres agents pathogènes tels celui de l'hépatite. Celle qui a 
recours à l'injection s'expose immédiatement au danger d'infection s'il y a partage de matériel 
contaminé. L'usage de drogue par voie autre que l'injection, y compris la consommation d'alcool, 
pose des risques indirects en ce sens qu'il peut accroître la possibilité de rapports sexuels et 
d'injections de drogue non sécuritaires (voir Riley, MacKenzie, Hankins et coll. 1995, pour un 
aperçu général). Le présent chapitre porte essentiellement sur le lien entre le VIH et la prise de 
drogue par injection puisqu'il existe encore peu de données sur le lien éventuel entre ce virus et 
l'usage de drogue par des voies autres que l'injection.<P>
<H2>Sources d'information</H2>
Il existe peu d'information sur le sida, le VIH, l'hépatite, l'administration de drogue par injection et 
le comportement à haut risque que l'on y associe. Deux sources permettent à ce jour de suivre 
l'évolution des profils d'infection au sein de la population canadienne : le bulletin trimestriel de 
surveillance du sida (Quarterly Surveillance update) de Santé Canada est la principale source 
permettant de suivre les nouveaux cas et décès de sida au pays. Les enquêtes auprès des 
populations de consommateurs de drogue dans les villes et des détenus dans les établissements 
pénitentiers aident à vérifier la propagation du VIH et du sida au sein des populations les plus 
vulnérables.<P>
<H2>Le sida et la prise de drogue par 
injection</H2>
Seule une petite proportion d'usagers de drogue ont recours à l'injection, mais ceux qui le font sont 
tout particulièrement vulnérables au VIH et au virus de l'hépatite. Sur le plan mondial, la 
toxicomanie par voie d'injection constitue l'un des premiers facteurs de transmission du VIH. Au 
Canada, elle vient en deuxième place, tout de suite après l'activité homosexuelle et bisexuelle chez 
les hommes, et tout de suite après l'activité hétérosexuelle chez les femmes. Le virus se transmet 
par voie sanguine lors du partage d'aiguilles, de seringues ou d'autre matériel souillés.<P>
En 1991, au Canada, on avait évalué à quelque 100 000 le nombre des toxicomanes pratiquant 
l'injection qui couraient le danger d'être infectés par le VIH à cause du partage d'aiguilles et de 
seringues contaminées (Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie [ARF], 1991). On les 
retrouve surtout dans les grandes agglomérations de Montréal, Toronto et Vancouver, mais ils sont 
néanmoins présents dans la plupart des régions urbaines et rurales du pays.<P>
L'héroïne représente depuis toujours la principale drogue administrée par injection au Canada; le 
Talwin et le Ritalin ont aussi été populaires à diverses périodes, dans différentes régions du pays. 
Depuis quelques années, la cocaïne se prend de plus en plus souvent par injection, seule ou en 
association avec l'héroïne. On constate également un usage non médical croissant de stéroïdes 
anabolisants chez les athlètes, les danseurs et la population mâle en général dans tout le pays.<P>
Au Canada comme ailleurs, la transmission du VIH chez les hétérosexuels se trouve accélérée par 
la propagation du virus chez les toxicomanes adeptes de l'injection, puisque ces derniers 
contaminent leurs partenaires sexuels. On estime que le tiers environ des toxicomanes par injection 
sont des femmes, dont au moins 40 % ont des rapports sexuels avec des non-usagers. Il y a aussi 
danger que les nouveau-nés soient  contaminés durant la période périnatale.<P>
Depuis 1977, 11 529 Canadiens environ ont développé le sida, dont 8 199 sont décédés (Santé 
Canada, 1995). Entre 1985 et 1992, le nombre des cas de sida a considérablement augmenté, celui 
des nouveaux cas s'étant accru entre 1987 et 1988 pour demeurer élevé par la suite (892 en 1987 
contre 1 529 en 1992).<P>
Les plus touchés par le sida sont les 20 à 49 ans, dans les proportions suivantes : 30 à 39 ans 
(44,0 %); 40 à 49 (26,5 %); 20 à 29 (17,8 %) (Tableau 7.3). L'Ontario compte quelque 41,5 % des 
cas de sida; le Québec, 29,7 %; la Colombie-Britannique, 17,6 %; et l'Alberta, 6,4 %. La mortalité 
reliée au sida obéit à un profil régional similaire. A ce jour, la grande majorité des décès reliés au 
sida sont survenus en Ontario (n=3 969) et au Québec (n=2 084).<P>
Par comparaison avec New York et Milan, où les taux de prévalence d'infection au VIH chez les 
toxicomanes pratiquant l'injection atteignent plus de 50 %, les taux enregistrés au Canada sont de 
faibles à modérés. Mais si l'on établit toutefois des comparaisons avec certaines villes européennes 
et australiennes (où les taux d'infection demeurent souvent en-deçà de 5 %), les taux de certaines 
régions canadiennes sont déjà élevés. En Colombie-Britannique, par exemple, la prévalence est 
passée de 3 % à 6 % entre 1992 et 1995 (Ministère de la Santé de la Colombie-Britannique, 1995). 
A Toronto, une enquête menée auprès des toxicomanes par injection en 1994 a révélé un taux de 
séropositivité de 7,6 % (ce taux inclut les participants homosexuels et bisexuels) 
comparativement à 4,8 % en 1992-1993 (Millson, communication personnelle, 1994). A Montréal, 
les taux varient entre 10 % et 22 %, selon le lieu de dépistage (Bruneau, Cloutier, Hankins, 
Morissette, communications personnelles, 1995). A Québec et à Ottawa, les taux de prévalence 
sont de 10 % environ (Santé Canada, 1995).<P>
Dans plusieurs villes canadiennes, les taux actuels de séropositivité chez les toxicomanes 
par injection sont très élevés. Les taux d'incidence relevés à Montréal et à Vancouver 
excèdent 5 % (Santé Canada, 1995), ce qui les place parmi les plus élevés en Amérique du 
Nord.<P>
De toute évidence, les taux de prévalence et d'incidence de l'infection au VIH chez les 
consommateurs de drogue par injection sont déjà très élevés dans certaines villes 
canadiennes. Une action intensive de prévention doit être engagée sans plus tarder (Riley, 
MacKenzie, Hankins et coll. 1995). Des experts de différents pays estiment que lorsque 
que les niveaux d'infection chez cette population atteindront 10 %, l'épidémie risquera 
alors de devenir explosive (Hankins, 1993). Il convient donc, face au sida et à la drogue, 
d'adopter une approche globale de réduction des méfaits si l'on veut maintenir la 
séropositivité à un bas niveau au Canada. Une telle approche suppose l'accessibilité 
immédiate à des seringues stériles, l'accès à des programmes souples et libéraux de 
distribution de la méthadone, et la fin de la marginalisation et de la criminalisation des 
usagers de drogue (Riley, 1993, 1994).<P>
<H2>Milieu carcéral</H2>
Les taux d'infection chez les usagers de drogues par injection dans les établissements correctionnels 
reflètent les niveaux d'infection observés pour ce genre de toxicomanes à l'extérieur des 
établissements. Dans les prisons provinciales du Québec, par exemple, 8 % des hommes et 13 % 
des femmes ayant recours à l'injection sont séropositifs (Hankins et coll., 1991, 1994).<P>
Des études des pénitenciers fédéraux en Colombie-Britannique et en Ontario ont révélé que 1 % 
environ des détenus testés étaient séropositifs, soit dix fois plus environ que dans la population en 
général (Calzavara, 1993; Rothon, 1993). Ceux qui ont déjà fait l'usage de drogue par injection 
sont les plus nombreux à être infectés (2,1 % en C.-B.; 3,8 % en Ontario).<P>
Au mois d'août 1995, les prisons fédérales du Canada comptaient 152 détenus séropositifs ou 
sidéens (SCC, 1995). Cela représente plus de 1 % des détenus fédéraux. Dans certains 
établissements, surtout au Québec, près de 5 % des détenus sont porteurs du VIH (Jurgens, 
1995).<P>
Les faits indiquent maintenant propagation rapide de l'hépatite B et C dans les prisons. Entre 
janvier et août 1995, 223 nouveaux cas d'hépatite active C et 22 nouveaux cas d'hépatite B ont été 
signalés dans les prisons fédérales du Canada (SCC, 1995). Ces chiffres tendent à démontrer qu'il 
pourrait y avoir propagation rapide du VIH dans les prisons.<P>
Trois études effectuées dans les prisons canadiennes ont établi les taux de séroprévalence de 
l'hépatite C entre 28 % et 40 % (Jurgens, 1995). L'hépatite C est normalement transmise, soit par 
les transfusions sanguines, soit par le partage de matériel souillé servant à la consommation de 
drogue. La transmission de l'hépatite C par voie sexuelle est moins courante. Chez les détenus, la 
positivité à l'hépatite C est un marqueur probable de la consommation de drogue par injection. Ces 
données suggèrent une très forte probabilité de la croissance de la séropositivité.<P>
De nombreux individus affirment avoir partagé leur matériel d'injection pour la première fois en 
prison; d'autres y être devenus des consommateurs de drogue, et d'autres encore à y avoir pratiqué 
l'injection. Il existe peu de moyens en place pour contrôler l'ampleur de la propagation du VIH en 
milieu carcéral (CESP, 1994; Jurgens, 1995; Riley, 1992).<P>

<H1>Le syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal</H1>

<H3>Points saillants</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Le syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal (SAF) concerne les inhibitions de croissance, les troubles du 
système nerveux central et un faciès caractérisé par une petite ouverture des yeux, une lèvre supérieure 
mince, et un sillon aplati au milieu de la lèvre supérieure. L'apparition du SAF est fonction de la quantité 
d'alcool consommé par la mère durant la grossesse, ainsi que des caractéristiques de la mère ou du foetus. 
On associe normalement le SAF avec les beuveries fréquentes.
<LI>En 1992-1993, dans tout le Canada, on a relevé seulement 18 femmes enceintes ayant reçu un 
diagnostic de préjudices au foetus dus à la consommation d'alcool, alors que 74 bébés ont été traités pour 
«influences nocives transmises par le placenta ou le lait maternel». 
<LI>En 1992-1993, 250 femmes enceintes ont été traitées pour dépendance aux drogues. Trente pour cent 
avaient entre 20 et 24 ans et plus de la moitié entre 25 et 34 ans. Seulement 10 cas de préjudices potentiels 
au foetus ont été déclarés. Quelque 72 cas de syndrome de sevrage de drogue chez les nouveau-nés et 18 
cas de préjudices possibles au foetus ont été déclarés.
<LI>On établit le nombre de cas de SAF à 0,33 par 1 000 naissances dans les pays occidentaux. Au 
Canada, une centaine d'enfants naîtraient victimes du SAF chaque année. L'incidence du SAF dans 
certaines communautés autochtones est nettement plus élevée qu'ailleurs au Canada. 
</UL>
<HR>


<H2>Terminologie</H2>
L'effet de l'alcool sur le foetus a été décrit pour la première fois en  1973 (Jones et Smith, 1973). 
Depuis, plus de 5 000 articles ont été publiés sur le sujet (Abel et Sokol, 1990). Des études 
démontrent que la consommation d'alcool durant la grossesse peut entraîner diverses malformations 
congénitales appelées «syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal (SAF)». Ce syndrome se traduit par des 
inhibitions de croissance (retard de croissance prénatal et/ou postnatal donnant un poids et/ou une 
longueur au dessous du 10e percentile), des troubles du système nerveux central (comprenant des 
anomalies neurologiques, des retards de développement, un comportement dysfonctionnel, un 
affaiblissement intellectuel, des malformations crâniennes ou cérébrales), ainsi qu'un faciès 
particulier (courtes fentes palpébrales [ouvertures des yeux], une lèvre supérieure mince et un 
enfoncement allongé et aplati de la lèvre supérieure [le sillon de la lèvre supérieure]) (U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, 1991). Lorsque certaines de ces anomalies seulement 
sont présentes et que la consommation prénatale d'alcool constitue une cause possible, on parle 
alors des effets de l'alcoolisme foetal (EAF). Le SAF et les EAF sont des troubles permanents 
(Ashley, 1994).<P>
L'apparition du SAF et des EAF dépendra dans quelle mesure la mère aura bu durant la grossesse, 
en association avec d'autres facteurs (Ashley, 1994). Ces facteurs concernent la consommation 
d'alcool et les caractéristiques de la mère ou du foetus. Par exemple, la fréquence des 
consommations et la quantité d'alcool consommé durant la grossesse, le stade de développement du 
foetus au moment de son exposition, l'état nutritionnel de la mère, la consommation d'autres 
drogues, le bagage génétique de la mère et du foetus et l'état de santé de la mère influencent tous le 
développement du SAF (Michaelis et Michaelis, 1994). L'âge, le poids, le nombre d'enfants et le 
tabagisme de la mère sont aussi importants. On associe les beuveries fréquentes au SAF. Certains 
groupes ou sous-groupes ethniques peuvent s'avérer plus vulnérables que d'autres aux effets nocifs 
de l'alcool, selon leur métabolisme de l'alcool (May, 1991; Ashley, 1994). Le principal produit 
métabolique de l'alcool, l'acétaldéhyde, peut engendrer certains effets du SAF (Michaelis et 
Michaelis, 1994). <P>
<H2>L'effet de l'alcool durant les stades de 
développement du foetus</H2>
La consommation d'importantes quantités d'alcool durant deux stades précis du développement 
peut induire le SAF. Le premier est la <I>période embryonnaire</I> (jusqu'à la huitième semaine 
du développement dans l'utérus) et le deuxième, la <I>période foetale</I> (de la huitième semaine 
du développement à l'accouchement). Durant la période embryonnaire, la pénétration directe de 
drogues dans le circuit sanguin ou leur  introduction par l'alimentation de la mère peut provoquer 
des anomalies. Les agents chimiques susceptibles de provoquer des monstruosités chez le foetus 
sont appelés les tératogènes. Ces agents agissent sélectivement sur certains organes. Leur effet 
variera selon le moment de l'exposition, la dose chimique absorbée par la mère et la sensibilité de 
chaque organe en développement au produit chimique en cause (Larsson, 1973; Michaelis et 
Michaelis, 1994). L'exposition à l'alcool durant le stade embryonnaire entraîne des malformations 
de la tête et du faciès (Michaelis et Michaelis, 1994), soit les anomalies les plus communes 
observées chez les victimes du SAF. L'exposition durant le stade foetal entraînera notamment un 
retard de croissance et des anomalies neurologiques (Scialli, 1992; Coles, 1994).<P>
<H2>L'incidence</H2>
Poser un diagnostic formel de SAF et de EAF n'est pas facile; seule une petite proportion des mères 
et des bébés affectés sont inclus dans les statistiques officielles.(1)  Ainsi en 1992-1993, dans tout 
le Canada, on a relevé seulement 18 femmes enceintes ayant reçu un diagnostic de préjudices au 
foetus dus à la consommation d'alcool. En outre, 74 bébés ont été traités dans les hôpitaux pour 
«influences nocives transmises par le placenta ou le lait maternel». <P>
On connaît mieux cependant les effets des drogues sur les mères et leurs enfants à naître. En 1992-
1993, 250 femmes enceintes ont été traitées pour dépendance aux drogues. Un tiers de ces femmes 
avaient entre 20 et 24 ans et une moitié entre 25 et 34 ans. Seulement 10 cas de préjudices 
potentiels au foetus et 72 cas de syndrome de sevrage de drogue chez les nouveau-nés ont été 
déclarés. <P>
Il n'existe aucune donnée nationale sur le taux d'incidence du SAF et des EAF au Canada (Ashley, 
1994). Selon des estimations conservatrices, on établit le nombre de cas de SAF à 0,33 par 1 000 
naissances dans les pays occidentaux (Abel et Sokol, 1991). Il naîtrait ainsi chaque année au 
Canada quelque 100 enfants victimes du SAF (Ashley, 1994) et quelque 1 200 aux Etats-Unis 
(Abel et Sokol, 1991). L'incidence du SAF de certaines communautés rurales isolées et de certaines 
communautés autochtones est supérieure à l'incidence nationale (Comité permanent de la santé et 
du bien-être social, 1992). L'incidence des EAF est environ trois fois plus grande que celle du SAF 
(Chambre des communes, 1991).<P>
Peu d'études ont été effectuées, mais il est déjà permis d'affirmer que l'ncidence du SAF est 
beaucoup plus grande dans certaines communautés autochtones qu'ailleurs au Canada (Scott, 
1994). Malgré les faiblesses méthodologiques de ces études, le collectif Robinson (1987) a établi 
l'incidence du SAF et des EAF à 190 cas par 1 000 enfants. Il a été constaté que les deux tiers des 
enfants atteints étaient mentalement retardés. Wong a évalué la manifestation du SAF à 4,7 
naissances autochtones sur 1 000, contre 0,25 sur 1 000 pour la population en général, les 
Autochtones compris (Abel et Sokol, 1991). Asante et Nelms-Matzke ont pour leur part conclu à 
un taux (SAF et EAF) de 25 sur 1 000 enfants (de 0 à 16 ans) chez les Autochtones du nord-ouest 
de la Colombie-Britannique (Métis et Indiens) et de 46 sur 1 000 chez ceux du Yukon, 
comparativement à 0,4 sur 1 000 chez les autres groupes des deux régions (Asante et Nelms-
Matzke, 1985). <P>
Selon des études américaines, l'incidence du SAF chez les Autochtones varie entre 1,4 à 9,8 sur 
1 000 (McTimoney et coll., 1989; Scott, 1994). Des taux élevés du SAF (5,1 sur 1 000) ont aussi 
été déclarés chez les populations autochtones de l'Alaska (Christensen, 1990). Les écarts observés 
peuvent s'expliquer par les divers degrés de l'abus d'alcool chez les femmes durant l'âge de 
fécondité, les variations marquant le métabolisme de l'alcool, les habitudes de consommation et les 
carences alimentaires dans les diverses communautés (Asante, 1981).<P>
Les communautés qui présentent des risques élevés ou peu élevés de problèmes d'alcool, SAF et 
EAF compris, présentent plusieurs particularités. Par exemple, certaines communautés autochtones 
ayant une propension marquée à consommer de l'alcool affichent des taux du SAF et de EAF 
beaucoup plus élevés que les autres (Ashley, 1994; May et coll., 1987). Ces taux devraient évoluer 
avec les années, en même temps que le niveau et le profil de consommation. L'affiliation tribale 
influence également les normes de consommation, tout comme dans le cas des autres cultures. Ces 
normes varient considérablement selon la communauté et le sous-groupe. Les communautés moins 
intégrées sur le plan social, dont les habitudes de consommation diffèrent dans chaque sous-groupe, 
comptent davantage de victimes du SAF et des EAF que les autres (Ashley, 1994).<P>
<H2>Questions de méthodologie</H2>
L'information rassemblée sur le syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal est loin d'être définitive. En raison de 
lacunes méthodologiques, les études menées à ce jour risquent de donner lieu à des estimations 
erronées de l'incidence du SAF. Par exemple, dans les études fondées sur un bassin de collecte des 
données, le SAF est diagnostiqué durant la période néonatale, alors que les caractéristiques comme 
les traits faciaux, le comportement du système nerveux central et le retard mental sont difficiles à 
percevoir et n'apparaissent pas avant que l'enfant soit plus âgé. Les études rétrospectives ont 
tendance à tirer leurs échantillons parmi les groupes dans lesquels on prévoit que le SAF se 
produira plus souvent. L'incidence du SAF peut aussi être surestimée lorsque les données sur la 
santé sont fournies par des organismes qui exigent le paiement d'un droit (c.-à-d. les compagnies 
d'assurance). Quant aux études prospectives, elles risquent de sous-évaluer l'incidence, puisque les 
femmes les plus susceptibles de donner naissance à des enfants victimes du SAF ne reçoivent pas 
de soins prénataux.<P>
Les études sur le SAF présentent d'autres lacunes encore plus fondamentales, principalement en ce 
qui concerne les populations les plus vulnérables. Des études des groupes minoritaires peuvent 
s'avérer gravement faussées (Abel et Sokol, 1991). Par exemple, deux des caractéristiques faciales 
les plus courantes associées au SAF, la petite ouverture des yeux et le sillon aplati de la lèvre 
supérieure, apparaissent normalement chez les Autochtones et chez les Noirs. Or vu ces traits 
ethniques particuliers, il convient de s'interroger sur l'incidence démesurément élevée du SAF chez 
ces populations, telle que l'établissent certaines études. Des diagnostics erronés du SAF peuvent 
donner lieu à une <I>surestimation</I> des effets associés à la consommation de petites quantités 
d'alcool durant la grossesse et créer une panique injustifiée chez les groupes non à risque.<P>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>
Les enfants correctement diagnostiqués victimes du SAF sont nés seulement de mères ayant 
consommé de fortes quantités d'alcool durant la grossesse. On saisit mal encore les autres facteurs 
de risque. Par exemple, les femmes qui boivent beaucoup durant la grossesse sont souvent pauvres, 
dénutries, déprimées et victimes d'abus. Ces problèmes sont normalement présents chez les 
populations qui consomment beaucoup.<P>
Les raisons de boire durant la grossesse reposent non seulement sur des convictions personnelles, 
mais aussi sur une combinaison complexe de facteurs socio-environnementaux et d'autres facteurs 
de renforcement, dont entre autres les habitudes de consommation des amis ou de la famille et les 
situations qui mènent à une forte consommation.<P>

<LI>La consommation de drogues illicites chez les jeunes de la rue est élevée, mais accuse néanmoins un 
recul.
<LI>Entre 1990 et 1992, moins de jeunes de la rue à Toronto ont déclaré faire usage de cannabis, de LSD, 
de cocaïne, de tranquilisants, de speed, d'héroïne et du produit «ice».
<LI>Les jeunes de la rue adoptent la drogue afin de surmonter les blessures laissées par la violence

</UL>

<HR>
<H2>Vue d'ensemble</H2>
Les jeunes de la rue sont de gros consommateurs de drogues illicites. Souvent considérés comme 
des fugueurs ou des rebuts de la société, les jeunes de la rue sont définis par deux facteurs : leur 
âge et leur absence du foyer pendant vingt-quatre heures ou plus sans la permission d'un parent 
(Radford et coll., 1989).  <P>
Les «rebuts de la société» sont ceux ouvertement rejetés par les parents (Radford et coll., 1989). 
Vu leur situation transitoire, il n'existe aucune estimation fiable de leur nombre à travers le pays. 
La taille et la composition du groupe varient continuellement (Zdanowicz et coll., 1993). Chaque 
année, au moins 150 000 jeunes de la rue se déplacent entre les grands centres urbains (Covenant 
House, 1988). <P>
Selon diverses études, ils choisissent la rue dans le but d'échapper à des situations d'abus physique, 
émotif ou sexuel ou encore de négligence au foyer (Radford et coll., 1989; Smart et coll., 1992; 
Anderson, 1992). Leur vie dans la rue suppose de nombreux comportements à haut risque 
(Radford et coll., 1989; Smart et coll., 1992; Anderson, 1992). Leur usage de la drogue, leur 
partage des seringues, leurs rapports sexuels non protégés, leur manque de ressources et leur 
difficulté à pratiquer une bonne hygiène, les rendent extrêmement vulnérables au VIH.<P>
<H2>Profils de consommation des 
drogues</H2>
La consommation de drogue chez les jeunes de la rue varie d'une ville à l'autre. D'après l'étude 
nationale menée par le collectif Radford en 1989, les deux tiers de ces jeunes consommaient de la 
drogue et/ou de l'alcool à toutes les semaines ou à tous les jours. Une faible proportion seulement 
s'abstenaient de toute substance. Les produits les plus populaires sont l'alcool, le cannabis, le LSD 
et la cocaïne (Radford et coll., 1989; Smart et coll., 1990; 1992; Anderson, 1992). La 
consommation des drogues illicites demeure très élevée au sein de cette population, mais on 
constate néanmoins un recul de la consommation générale. <P>
<B>L'alcool :</B> La majorité des jeunes de la rue consomment de l'alcool, mais un nombre 
important s'en abstiennent. Le Tableau 6.1 montre que, en 1989, 88 % de l'échantillon des jeunes 
de la rue constitué pour l'étude nationale précitée consommaient de l'alcool, dont 9 % 
quotidiennement, mais que 12 % s'en abstenaient. En 1992, un taux tout aussi élevé de ces jeunes, 
à Halifax, ont déclaré avoir consommé de l'alcool l'année précédente, mais seulement 5 % 
quotidiennement. Ces taux sont toutefois nettement supérieurs à ceux observés pour Toronto, où 
95 % environ avaient consommé de l'alcool l'année précédente, dont 6 % à tous les jours.<P>
<B>Le cannabis :</B> En 1989, 71 % des participants à une étude nationale des jeunes de la rue 
avaient consommé du cannabis l'année précédente, dont 24 % presque quotidiennement (Radford et 
coll., 1989). En 1992, à Halifax, quelque 66 % des jeunes de la rue en avaient aussi consommé 
l'année précédente, dont 27 % quotidiennement (Anderson et coll., 1992). A Toronto, l'usage 
déclaré de cannabis était supérieur à ceux des autres villes, 83 % en ayant consommé l'année 
précédente (Smart et coll., 1992). Le taux des consommateurs quotidiens de cannabis s'y est par 
contre maintenu à 15 % entre 1990 et 1992.<P>
<B>La cocaïne et le crack :</B> En 1989, quelque 31 % des jeunes de la rue au Canada avaient 
consommé de la cocaïne l'année précédente, dont 4 % quotidiennement. En 1992, ces taux à 
Halifax s'établissaient à 18 % et à 4 % respectivement. Un jeune sur huit y avait déclaré faire 
usage de crack, dont 4 % à tous les jours. A Toronto, les taux atteignaient 31 % et 3 % 
respectivement pour la cocaïne, et 31 % et 5 % pour le crack.<P>
<B>Le LSD et les autres hallucinogènes :</B> En 1989, 44 % des jeunes de la rue au Canada 
avaient utilisé du LSD l'année précédente, dont 4 % quotidiennement. A Toronto, ces taux étaient 
de 59 % et de 1 % respectivement. Les jeunes de la rue de Toronto, Halifax et des autres grands 
centres du pays consomment aussi régulièrement les produits «ice» et «ecstasy». La majorité 
utilisent par ailleurs des inhalants, dont la colle industrielle, les diluants à peinture et d'autres 
solvants, en raison de leur bas prix et de leur facilité d'accès.<P>
En règle générale, on consomme surtout le cannabis (92 fois l'année précédente), le crack (68 fois) 
et la cocaïne (49 fois) (Smart et coll., 1992).<P>
L'âge d'initiation varie selon la nature du produit. Le jeune de la rue commence normalement à 
consommer le cannabis à 13 ans et le LSD, à 15 ans. Il essaie la plupart des autres drogues à 
16 ans, sauf le crack et l'héroïne, dont il tente généralement l'expérience à 18 ans.<P>
<B>La consommation de drogue par injection :</B> La prise de drogue par injection et le 
partage des seringues font du jeune de la rue une proie facile du VIH. En 1989, 12 % des 
participants à l'étude nationale ont admis s'injecter des drogues telles le Talwin, le Ritalin, le speed, 
la cocaïne, et l'héroïne, et près de 50 %, partager les seringues (Radford et coll., 1989). A Toronto, 
28 % avaient fait l'expérience de l'injection et   4 % avaient partagé les seringues l'année précédente 
(Smart et coll., 1992). <P>
<B>Baisse de l'usage de la drogue : </B>Selon des études effectuées par la Fondation de la 
recherche sur la toxicomanie, l'usage de la drogue chez les jeunes de la rue à Toronto régresse 
(Smart et coll., 1992). Entre 1990 et 1992, l'usage du cannabis est passé de 92 % à 83 %; celui du 
LSD, de 70 % à 59 %; de la cocaïne, de 64 % à 31 %; des tranquilisants, de 59 % à 29 %; du 
speed, de 24 % à 9 %; de l'héroïne, de 13 % à 4 %; et du produit «ice», de 5 % à 1 %. (Figure 6.2). 
L'usage simultané de plusieurs drogues a aussi accusé une diminution générale durant la même 
période. La proportion des jeunes utilisant cinq drogues ou plus est tombée de 38 % à 22 %, alors 
que celle des jeunes utilisant une ou deux drogues seulement a légèrement augmenté, passant de 
15 % à 36 %. <P>
<H2>Les problèmes reliés à la drogue</H2>
L'étude de 1992 réalisée sur les jeunes de la rue à Toronto (Smart et coll., 1992) a notamment 
porté sur les problèmes reliés à la drogue. La moitié environ des participants à cette enquête ont 
déclaré avoir fait l'expérience de flash-back ou d'évanouissements, et le quart, ne pas être capables 
d'abandonner la drogue comme ils le voulaient. Quelque 40 % s'inquiétaient de leur consommation, 
et 35 % souhaitaient la réduire. Si l'on compare les chiffres de 1992 à ceux de 1990, on constate 
pour la première année qu'un plus grand nombre de jeunes ont été arrêtés pour infractions reliées à 
la drogue (26 % contre 34 %), ont éprouvé des problèmes médicaux (19 % contre 22 %), ont 
demandé de l'aide (21 % contre 30 %) et ont reçu des soins médicaux  (13 % contre 21 %) (Smart 
et coll., 1992).<P>
L'étude a par ailleurs démontré que les jeunes de Toronto participaient davantage aux activités 
illégales que ceux de Halifax (Smart et coll., 1992; Anderson, 1992). Dans les deux villes, 27 % et 
15 % respectivement avaient pris part à des vols par effraction; 43 % et 16 % vendaient de la 
drogue; 23 % et 14 % avaient participé à des vols ou à des vols qualifiés, Quelque 10 % dans les 
deux villes se prostituaient. A Toronto, l'alcool ou la drogue représentait une part importante de 
leurs activités illégales, soit 28 % en ce qui concernait les vols par effraction;  65 %, la 
prostitution; 48 %, la vente de drogue; et 51 %, les vols qualifiés.<P>
Les jeunes adoptent la drogue afin de surmonter les blessures laissées par la violence familiale et 
les épreuves quotidiennes inhérentes à leur mode de vie. Ils l'adoptent aussi en raison de sa facilité 
d'accès. Elle les aide à affronter ou à oublier leur situation, surtout s'ils se prostituent ou vendent 
eux-mêmes de la drogue pour survivre.<P>

<LI>Les jeunes Autochtones sont de deux à six fois plus nombreux à éprouver des problèmes reliés à 
l'alcool que leurs homologues des autres segments de la population canadienne.
<LI>Le taux de suicide est beaucoup plus élevé chez les enfants indiens de la Saskatchewan (0 à 14 ans) 
que chez les jeunes du même âge dans l'ensemble du pays ou de la province (27,5 fois plus élevé que pour 
l'ensemble des enfants canadiens et 33,6 fois plus élevé que pour l'ensemble des enfants de la 
Saskatchewan).
<LI>Les hommes autochtones tendent à faire abus d'alcool tandis que les femmes autochtones font plutôt 
abus de drogue seulement.
<LI>L'an dernier, 30 % des hommes et 16 % des femmes (Inuit et Dénés) ont consommé du cannabis.
<LI>Selon le Système de rapports sur les activités de traitement (SRAT), les stupéfiants viennent au 
deuxième rang des drogues les plus populaires chez les Autochtones adultes qui se font traiter.
<LI>La majorité des Canadiens autochtones fument, dont la moitié quotidiennement.
<LI>Un jeune Autochtone sur cinq a déjà utilisé des solvants. Un tiers de ces consommateurs ont moins

<HR>
<H2>Introduction</H2><B>
</B>Il serait téméraire de la part du lecteur que de vouloir assimiler toute l'information ici 
présentée sans en connaître les limitations et les possibilités. Aussi convient-il, à ce propos, de 
préciser que bien qu'il s'agisse d'un profil exclusivement canadien, cette distinction perd tout sens 
pour les chercheurs ou les groupes autochtones, puisque la similarité des contextes de chaque côté 
de la frontière canado-américaine justifierait que l'on s'attarde aux données américaines. Quant aux 
bases de données canadiennes, la plupart font exclusion d'un segment fort important des peuples 
indigènes, les Métis. En outre, sauf indication contraire, on <I>ne peut pas</I> généraliser cette 
information pour l'appliquer aux contextes hors réserve (urbains compris), où vivent, comme nous 
le savons, la majorité des populations autochtones au Canada.<P>
Pendant que certains soutiennent que l'état de santé des populations autochtones est semblable 
indépendamment qu'elles habitent la ville ou la campagne, d'autres suggèrent que celui des 
populations urbaines est peut-être un peu mieux que celles des régions rurales.(1)  Mais la question 
n'a jamais été entièrement élucidée.<P>
Les indicateurs sociaux servant à analyser la toxicomanie et ses effets chez les Autochtones sont 
normalement recueillis par le gouvernement fédéral (c.-à-d. la  Direction des services médicaux, 
Santé Canada), dont les méthodes de collecte varient considérablement d'une région et d'une 
province à l'autre. Il y a donc absence de données normatives nationales. Et là où l'on effectue des 
enquêtes, rarement se penche-t-on sur la validité conceptuelle et sur la fiabilité des outils  utilisés. 
Mentionnons en outre que le fardeau de réponse imposé par la kyrielle de sondages et de 
questionnaires administrés ces dernières années a eu pour effet de teinter la plupart des données 
d'une certaine apathie ou d'entraîner un taux élevé de non participation.<P>
Par ailleurs, ajoutées aux autres divergences culturelles, les différences entre les sciences 
occidentales et autochtones viennent compliquer encore davantage les communications, la collecte 
et l'interprétation des données. La structure communautaire des groupes éparpillés est extrêmement 
hétérogène, et il arrive qu'au sein même de certaines collectivités, de nombreux sujets reconnus 
comme «Indiens» soient d'origines raciales et ethniques différentes. Les populations autochtones 
urbaines ne sont pas relevées comme telles ou ne participent pas aux sondages canadiens tels 
l'Enquête nationale sur l'alcool et les autres drogues.<P>
Il est néanmoins, à partir d'une évaluation brute et indirecte, de dégager clairement certaines 
tendances. Ainsi, le profil fourni ci-après vise à compléter les travaux antérieurs du CCLAT et de 
l'administration fédérale sur le sujet (auxquels nous renvoyons le lecteur pour de plus amples 
informations), malgré que certaines données soient purement répétitives. Ce profil souligne ce que 
l'on sait déjà de la toxicomanie en milieu autochtone et illustre, dans la mesure du possible, les 
écarts existant entre les Indiens des réserves et de l'extérieur, les Métis et les Inuit.<P>
<H2>Calcul de l'incidence</H2>
En règle générale, on infère de l'usage des drogues en se fondant sur les indicateurs sociaux, et la 
majorité de ceux-ci indiquent clairement que les populations autochtones risquent beaucoup plus 
que les autres de souffrir des conséquences physiques de l'abus de ces produits.(2)  Mais les 
formules habituellement utilisées pour mesurer l'alcoolisme, qui s'appuient sur les cas de cirrhose 
du foie, ne conviennent pas à la durée de vie des populations autochtones. Dans un même ordre 
d'idée, la marginalisation des groupes autochtones a rendu leur capture par les bases de données 
difficiles, et aucune étude ne s'est penchée sur les diagnostics et les taux de départ reliés à l'alcool 
les concernant. Par conséquent, les données les plus révélatrices sont les taux de mort violente, qui 
présentent de fortes corrélations statistiques avec l'abus des drogues.(3,4)<P>
La Direction des services médicaux (DSM), chargée des services de santé auprès des Indiens et des 
Inuit, estime que les principales causes de décès chez les populations qu'elle dessert sont, dans 
l'ordre, les blessures et les empoisonnements (suicides compris) ainsi que les maladies de l'appareil 
circulatoire, sauf dans les régions de l'Atlantique et de l'Ontario, où les décès imputables à ces 
dernières étaient plus nombreux que ceux causés par les blessures et les empoisonnements. Il s'agit 
là de tendances relativement stables dans les données sur la mortalité concernant ce 
groupe.(2,5)<P>
Les profils autochtones de mort violente indiquent régulièrement un risque particulièrement élevé. 
Dans certains cas, le taux excède même de trois ou quatre fois les normes nationales, et la plupart 
des écarts entre les groupes sont attribuables aux jeunes. Lorsque l'on procède à une ventilation 
selon la région et le sexe, il est clair que les taux de mort violente augmentent au fur et à mesure 
que l'on se déplace vers les régions de l'ouest et du nord et qu'ils visent principalement les 
hommes.(6)<P>
Le suicide a toujours constitué un important indicateur de détresse sociale et compose un sous-
ensemble de la catégorie des morts violentes, laquelle comporte également d'étroites corrélations 
statistiques avec la toxicomanie.(4)  Or bien que  certaines études aient démontré que les taux de 
mort violente vont croissant du sud au nord,(7,8) les profils de suicide établis pour la Colombie-
Britannique indiquent pour leur part que les groupes les plus à risque sont ceux de l'intérieur.(9)  
En fait, le collectif Cooper (1992) a constaté que les taux de suicide des populations vivant hors 
réserve (16:100 000) suivaient étroitement ceux de la Colombie-Britannique en général, tandis que 
ceux des populations vivant sur les réserves étaient considérablement plus élevés (37:100 000). 
Fait important, on a découvert au sujet des réserves qu'il existait une nette différence structurelle 
entre les groupes ayant des taux de suicide élevés et ceux ayant des taux peu élevés : <P>
<I>«En règle générale, les répondants provenant d'endroits marqués par de hauts taux de 
suicide possédaient un niveau d'instruction inférieur; vivaient dans des foyers comptant un plus 
grand nombre d'occupants; comptaient davantage d'enfants au foyer; comprenaient plus de chefs 
de familles monoparentales et moins d'aînés, et disposaient de revenus inférieurs, produits par 
une plus petite proportion de la population» (page 21).(9)</I><P>
On a tenté de procéder à une comparaison similaire en ce qui concerne les régions non autochtones 
présentant des taux de suicide élevés et faibles, mais les résultats ont donné plus de similarités que 
d'écarts. Il serait donc impossible, selon les auteurs, de prévoir les taux de suicide chez les non 
Autochtones en se fondant sur les seules caractéristiques examinées (page 21).(9)<P>
Contrairement à ce que l'on a observé au regard des taux de décès dus aux blessures et aux 
empoisonnements, qui vont croissant d'est en ouest et du sud au nord, les taux de suicide (Indiens et 
Inuit) fournis par la Direction des services médicaux indiquent que les hommes seraient plus 
vulnérables dans les régions de l'Atlantique, de l'Alberta, du Pacifique et du Yukon, et les femmes, 
dans les régions du Pacifique, de l'Alberta et de l'Ontario.<P>
On s'est déjà beaucoup attardé au suicide comme indicateur de détresse sociale, mais il convient de 
souligner que les taux de mort accidentelle sont parfois deux fois plus élevés que les taux de 
suicide.(10)  Selon une analyse tendancielle des taux de mort naturelle en Alberta, portant sur cinq 
années, les Autochtones sont de quatre à cinq fois plus vulnérables que l'ensemble de la 
population.(10)  Un risque aussi élevé a également été documenté en Saskatchewan et en 
Colombie-Britannique.(7,11)  En Saskatchewan, l'étude a démontré que les groupes du nord étaient 
considérablement plus à risque que ceux des régions moins isolées.<P>
<H2>Ecarts entre les sexes</H2>
L'analyse des indicateurs sociaux nous apprend que le phénomène de la toxicomanie présente des 
écarts évidents entre les sexes. Dans le cas des décès dus aux blessures et aux empoisonnements, 
on note ainsi un écart important et relativement stable entre les sexes chez les Indiens et les Inuit, 
les hommes étant beaucoup plus nombreux que les femmes à décéder de mort violente.(2,5) Ces 
observations laissent croire, d'une part, que les femmes ne souffrent pas de la toxicomanie dans une 
mesure aussi grande que les hommes; de fait, elles ne sont pas aussi nombreuses à décéder de mort 
violente ou accidentelle et, d'autre part,  qu'elles en souffrent peut-être autant, mais d'une façon 
probablement fort différente. En d'autres termes, les conséquences physiques de leur toxicomanie 
ne sont pas aussi fatales que chez leurs homologues masculins. Cette conclusion est appuyée par le 
fait que, lorsque nous examinons l'influence de la société sur l'abus des drogues et les profils de 
consommation des adolescents, les profils des femmes et des hommes se rapprochent davantage 
entre les divers groupes autochtones qu'avec ceux des Canadiens en général.(12,13,14)  Un examen 
des diagnostics associés à l'abus selon le sexe et des taux de départ des hôpitaux pourrait nous 
fournir une certaine idée de la conclusion à tirer.(15)<P>
Lorsque l'on s'arrête aux écarts entre les sexes à l'intérieur d'un même groupe, il ressort, du moins 
dans le cas des Maritimes, que les hommes autochtones sont plus nombreux que les femmes à boire 
avec excès, mais que les femmes autochtones sont par contre plus nombreuses à consommer des 
drogues uniquement.(16)  Selon l'enquête du Yukon sur l'alcool et les autres drogues, la 
consommation d'alcool chez les femmes autochtones serait plus irrégulière et moins fréquente que 
chez les hommes, mais ces derniers seraient près de trois fois plus nombreux à se déclarer gros et 
fréquents buveurs.<P>
En ce qui concerne la consommation du tabac, seul un léger écart entre les sexes a été noté dans le 
rapport de 1991 sur le tabagisme au sein des populations autochtones du Canada, qui tient 
notamment compte du fait que les femmes plus âgées sont plus nombreuses à n'avoir jamais fumé 
quotidiennement (27 % contre 18 % chez les hommes) et que les femmes de 65 ans et plus sont 
aussi plus nombreuses à ne pas fumer (28 % contre 38 % chez les hommes). La ventilation des 
données selon l'âge et le sexe révèle de légers écarts dans les profils de consommation des 45 ans et 
plus. On compte plus de fumeuses légères chez les femmes de 45 à 64 ans (1 à 10 cigarettes par 
jour, 30 % contre 17 % chez les hommes), mais plus de gros fumeurs chez les hommes de la même 
catégorie d'âge (au moins 26 cigarettes par jour, 13 % contre 6 % chez les femmes).(18)<P>
Aucun examen de la toxicomanie effectué en fonction du sexe ne peut être considéré complet sans 
un profil de l'incidence du SAF (Syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal). L'estimation de l'incidence et de la 
prévalence du FAS dans les collectivités autochtones demeure fort controversée. Selon Bray et 
Anderson (1989), les taux exagérément élevés actuellement publiés sont dus au fait que l'on ne tient 
pas compte des taux de fertilité plus élevés et de la plus longue durée de la période 
d'enfantement.(19)  Quant à Burd et Moffat (1994), ils imputent une partie de cette inflation aux 
méthodes de sélection et aux critères de diagnostic, qui ne sont toujours pas exposés dans la 
documentation. Sur le plan de la méthodologie, ils recommandent que les chercheurs :<P>
a) ignorent l'ingestion d'alcool par la mère<P>
b) sélectionnent des collectivités où les taux peuvent être bas<P>
c) réalisent des études longitudinales des cohortes<P>
d) examinent les certificats de décès chaque fois que cela est possible.(20)<P>
La majorité des rapports parus sur le sujet indiquent que les taux d'incidence du SAF sont 
effectivement supérieurs à la moyenne chez les Autochtones du Canada, bien qu'une importante 
fluctuation marque les données américaines. Des estimations modérées de l'incidence du SAF et des 
EAF (effets de l'alcoolisme foetal) effectuées à partir des échantillons de l'ensemble de la 
population ont donné un rapport de 1 à 3 sur 1 000,(21) tandis que des études américaines ont 
conclu que l'incidence du SAF chez les Indiens varie entre 1,4 et 9,8 sur 1 000 habitants.(22)  
Enfin, une étude canadienne a établi le taux de SAF/EAF à 25 par 1 000 enfants (0 à 16 ans) chez 
les Autochtones du nord-ouest de la Colombie-Britannique (Métis et Indiens) et à 46 sur 1 000 
chez les groupes autochtones du Yukon. Le taux observé pour l'ensemble des populations 
canadiennes dans les deux régions était de 0,4 sur 1 000.(23)<P>
Même si l'on met en doute les méthodes épidémiologiques utilisées lors des études canadiennes, les 
femmes indiennes reconnaissent «que la capacité du peuple Indien à se réaliser pleinement se 
trouve menacée par l'affaiblissement de la race, associé au syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal».(24)  Par 
conséquent, bien que l'on ne puisse pas déterminer avec exactitude la prévalence et prévoir le 
nombre potentiel des femmes autochtones alcooliques ou de celles qui risquent de donner naissance 
à un enfant victime du SAF ou des EAF, il est clair que l'abus de drogue entraîne davantage de 
conséquences graves et débilitantes dans certaines régions que pour l'ensemble des femmes nord-
américaines.<P>
<H2>Les enfants</H2>
Mis à part les éventuelles répercussions du SAF et des EAF sur les enfants, il est rare que les 
profils de toxicomanie tiennent compte des caractéristiques particulières de la consommation de 
drogue chez les moins de 12 ans. Cette consommation chez les adolescents a certes reçu beaucoup 
d'attention, mais dans le cas des enfants, la seule documentation qui décrive les tendances de 
consommation porte sur des drogues spécifiques (notamment, le tabac à priser ou à chiquer et les 
solvants). Pourtant, le taux alarmant de la consommation de drogue dans ce groupe d'âge constitue 
l'un des faits épidémiologiques les plus troublants qui soient concernant la toxicomanie en milieu 
autochtone. Les enfants consomment normalement le tabac (tabac sans fumée compris), l'alcool, le 
cannabis et les solvants, mais dans le cas de plusieurs drogues,(25,26,27,28,29,30) ils 
commencent à consommer à un âge sensiblement plus jeune que leurs homologues 
d'Amérique du Nord et, au Canada, leur admission dans les établissements de traitement 
autochtones se fait aussi à un plus jeune âge,(31,32,33) surtout dans les provinces du centre et de 
l'ouest. Fiddler (1985) a découvert que les enfants indiens (0 à 14 ans) de la Saskatchewan 
présentaient un taux de suicide <I>tragiquement</I> élevé par rapport aux moyennes nationale et 
provinciale établies pour les enfants du même groupe d'âge (27,5 fois plus élevé que la moyenne 
nationale et 33,6 fois plus élevé que la moyenne de la Saskatchewan).(7)  Dans le dernier profil des 
habitudes toxicomaniaques dressé au regard des populations autochtones vivant en centre urbain, 
67% des Centres d'amitié participant ont déclaré que les enfants consommaient de l'alcool et 
reniflaient des solvants durant les heures de classe, après la classe, dans la rue et à la maison, et 
parfois avec la famille.(34)<P>
<H2>Consommation d'alcool</H2>
Sauf les faits auto-déclarés par les participants aux enquêtes, les données de l'enquête 
postcensitaire tenue auprès des peuples autochtones (EAPA), ainsi que les données fournies par les 
centres de traitement autochtones, il existe très peu de données décrivant immédiatement la 
consommation de l'alcool dans les collectivités autochtones. L'enquête des Territoires du Nord-
Ouest sur la promotion de la santé nous renseigne en partie sur les Inuit et les Dénés qui ont été 
regroupés aux fins de ces analyses.(12)  Réponses des participants aux questions sur la 
consommation de l'alcool ont en effet révélé une polarisation nettement plus importante des 
habitudes de consommation chez ces groupes autochtones du nord, lesquels comptent plus 
d'abstinents et plus de gros buveurs.<P>
Par ailleurs, l'enquête du Yukon sur l'alcool et les autres drogues, pour laquelle on avait ventilé les 
répondants selon l'ethnicité et la catégorie de buveurs, a permis de dégager les tendances 
suivantes(17) : à l'instar de l'enquête des Territoires du Nord-Ouest sur la promotion de la santé, 
elle révèle une plus grande polarisation des habitudes de consommation d'alcool chez les groupes 
autochtones, et ce, indépendamment du sexe. La ventilation selon l'ethnicité et l'âge a toutefois 
permis d'attribuer la majeure partie de cette polarisation aux plus de 20 ans. Dans l'ensemble, les 
adolescents canadiens accusaient une polarisation légèrement plus importante que leurs 
homologues autochtones de l'échantillon yukonais.<P>
Un examen plus poussé des habitudes de consommation d'alcool des adolescents a fait ressortir 
plusieurs écarts régionaux. On a ainsi constaté, dans un échantillon du Manitoba, que les 
adolescents indiens et métis vivant hors réserve se rapprochaient sensiblement de leurs homologues 
non autochtones par leurs habitudes, mais que des écarts plus marqués séparaient les sujets des 
échantillons canadiens en général des adolescents indiens vivant sur les réserves au Québec. Ces 
écarts sont potentiellement attribuables au fait que le groupe autochtone de comparaison diffère par 
son lieu d'habitation, ou au fait que les caractéristiques géographiques du groupe canadien général 
de comparaison s'apparentent à celles du groupe autochtone de l'échantillon du Manitoba.<P>
Les résultats de l'enquête la plus récente sur les habitudes de consommation d'alcool chez les 
peuples autochtones paraissent dans le sous-ensemble «questions de langue, de santé et de société» 
(Language, Health and Social Issues) de l'enquête de 1991 sur les peuples autochtones. 
Heureusement, ces données permettent de comparer entre eux les groupes autochtones, nommément 
les Indiens des réserves et de l'extérieur, les Inuit et les Métis. Elles confirment en outre la 
polarisation nettement plus grande des habitudes de consommation déjà observée lors d'études 
antérieures, c'est-à-dire que les groupes autochtones comptent plus d'abstinents et de gros buveurs 
que la population canadienne en général. Lorsque l'on s'arrête à l'abstention selon le groupe 
autochtone, on constate que les Inuit présentent un taux d'abstinents considérablement plus élevé 
que les Indiens ou les Métis.<P>
Ces résultats laissent croire à une plus grande polarisation dans les régions du Nord. Les profils de 
consommation observés selon le groupe autochtone tendent à confirmer l'influence de la 
communauté. A la question de savoir s'ils croyaient que l'abus d'alcool constituait un problème au 
sein de leur communauté, les Indiens des réserves et de l'extérieur étaient plus nombreux à le croire 
que les Métis ou les Inuit. Ces derniers étaient cependant plus nombreux à croire que l'abus 
d'alcool n'était pas un problème.(35)<P>
<H2>Abus de drogue</H2>
L'évaluation directe des habitudes d'abus de drogue est pour une bonne part réalisée auprès des 
adolescents. Les données sur les adultes tirées de l'enquête des Territoires du Nord-Ouest sur la 
promotion de la santé révèlent que 30 % des hommes autochtones et 16 % des femmes autochtones 
(Inuit et Dénés) ont déclaré avoir consommé du cannabis l'année précédente. Le Système de 
rapports des activités de traitement (SRAT) indique que les stupéfiants se classent régulièrement au 
deuxième rang des drogues les plus populaires parmi les adultes en établissement.(31,32,33)  Les 
plus récentes données canadiennes disponibles sur la consommation de drogue chez les 
adolescents autochtones (limitées aux Indiens et aux Métis vivant hors réserve) ont été recueillies 
dans une ville non métropolitaine du Manitoba.(36) Or il est intéressant de noter que le taux de 
consommation de la marijuana y est trois fois plus élevée chez les adolescents autochtones. De 
plus, ces jeunes affichaient régulièrement des taux de consommation nettement plus élevés pour les 
analgésiques non médicaux, le LSD et d'autres hallucinogènes. Le groupe autochtone a aussi 
enregistré une plus forte consommation de crack, de cocaïne, de PCP, de stimulants, de speed, 
d'héroïne et de barbituriques. Ces résultats s'éloignent légèrement d'une comparaison antérieure des 
adolescents indiens vivant sur les réserves et des adolescents canadiens en général, qui indiquait des 
taux inférieurs de consommation des dépresseurs, des hallucinogènes et des stimulants dans le 
groupe indien, tous âge confondus, et des taux de consommation supérieurs de cocaïne et de 
solvants dans les tranches d'âge inférieures des Canadiens en général. Cependant, des taux 
régulièrement plus élevés de consommation de cannabis ont été observés pour le groupe des Indiens 
du Québec, et ce pour toutes les tranches d'âge.(13)<P>
<H2>Consommation de tabac</H2>
Selon l'enquête des Territoires du Nord-Ouest sur la promotion de la santé, il est clair que la très 
grande majorité des Autochtones (Inuit et Dénés) hommes et femmes fument la cigarette (femmes 
72 %, hommes 71 %) et que bon nombre d'entre eux fument régulièrement (femmes 57 %, hommes 
59 %).(12)  Une enquête nationale menée auprès des femmes indiennes et inuit a révélé que 78 % 
des femmes inuit fumaient avant la grossesse, 76 % durant la grossesse, et 75 % dans le premier 
mois suivant la grossesse. Chez les femmes indiennes, 54 % fumaient durant la grossesse et tout 
près de la moitié (49 %) fumaient avant et après la grossesse.(37)<P>
L'information la plus récente et la plus complète dont nous disposions sur les habitudes de 
tabagisme des Autochtones au Canada provient des données de l'Enquête auprès des peuples 
autochtones, dont les résultats d'analyse ont été présentés dans le rapport intitulé, <I>Le tabagisme 
chez les peuples autochtones au Canada, 1991</I>.(54)  Ce rapport nous apprend que la majorité 
(57 %) des 15 ans et plus fument. Les fumeurs quotidiens (46 %) sont presque deux fois plus 
nombreux que dans l'ensemble de la population canadienne (26%). Comme dans le cas de l'alcool, 
ce sont les 20 à 44 ans qui fument le plus. La vaste majorité (65 %) des 20 à 24 ans fument 
régulièrement, et plus de la moitié (53 %) affirment fumer quotidiennement. Peu d'écarts ont été 
observés entre les sexes, mais plus le niveau d'instruction et le revenu sont élevés, moins on fume. 
Des variations régionales sont également évidentes.(38)<P>
En plus de la grande variabilité relevée quant au taux des fumeurs actuels (fumeurs quotidiens et 
occasionnels) selon la région, un écart semble marquer les habitudes de tabagisme selon la région. 
Les populations autochtones des Maritimes présentent les taux de consommation quotidienne les 
plus élevés, tandis que celles de la Saskatchewan, de la Colombie-Britannique et des Territoires du 
Nord-Ouest ont des taux relativement bas. Ainsi, les groupes du nord comptent plus de fumeurs 
actuels que dans les autres régions, mais moins de fumeurs quotidiens.<P>
Tous âges confondus, les Inuit comptent beaucoup plus de fumeurs actuels que les Indiens ou les 
Métis. Peu d'écarts existent entre les groupes des deux sexes, mais les Métis sont plus nombreux 
que les Indiens ou les Inuit à fumer quotidiennement.<P>
<H2>Consommation de solvants</H2>
Lors d'un sondage national effectué récemment auprès des jeunes Autochtones et des fournisseurs 
de services représentant les populations indiennes, métis et inuit, on a dégagé le profil suivant des 
consommateurs excessifs de solvants :<P>
a)  Les jeunes commencent à consommer vers 9 ou 10 ans, mais certains commencent à renifler dès 
l'âge de 5 ans; l'âge des premières consommations semblent diminuer régulièrement.<P>
b)  Les garçons sont plus nombreux que les filles à faire excès de solvants, mais ces dernières sont 
plus nombreuses que jamais.<P>
c)  Les jeunes qui font abus de solvants proviennent de familles dysfonctionnelles déjà marquées 
par la toxicomanie.<P>
d)  Les consommateurs de solvants viennent souvent de collectivités isolées, ont de piètres résultats 
scolaires ou sont des décrocheurs scolaires.<P>
e)  Sont associés aux cas de renifflage, le chômage, l'analphabétisme, les mauvaises conditions de 
logement et les antécédents d'abus physique, affectif et sexuel.(39)<P>
Une enquête sur la consommation de solvants par les jeunes des communautés Inuit et des 
Premières nations a révélé que la majorité des participants (49,3 %) avaient commencé à renifler 
entre 4 et 11 ans. Comparativement à la moyenne globale, un taux nettement plus élevé d'enfants 
ont commencé à utiliser des solvants à cet âge en Alberta (79,4 %), en Saskatchewan (64,8 %) et 
au Yukon (81,3 %). Parmi les facteurs familiaux et sociaux associés à leur consommation de 
solvants, notons l'abus d'alcool et de drogue au foyer (67,2 %), les conflits familiaux (65,3 %), le 
chômage (51,7 %), la malnutrition ou la négligence (43,5 %), les problèmes financiers du foyer 
(42,3 %) et l'agression physique (31,3 %).(40)<P>
Selon une récente enquête pluriannuelle menée auprès des adolescents au Manitoba, le renifflage de 
la colle était plus courant dans le groupe Indien-Métis sauf en 1992, mais l'usage de solvants était 
régulièrement plus important dans ce même groupe indépendamment de l'année d'étude.(36)<P>
<H2>Centres de traitement autochtones</H2>
Le Système de rapports des activités de traitement (SRAT) fournit les données les plus actuelles 
sur les toxicomanes traités en établissement. Or ces données nationales révèlent que les substances 
dont on fait toujours le plus grand abus sont, dans l'ordre, l'alcool et les stupéfiants, l'alcool étant 
préféré au moins une fois sur deux.(31,32,33)  De récents ensembles de données du SRAT 
démontrent un abus croissant de l'abus des stupéfiants et des drogues sur ordonnance; il convient 
cependant d'interpréter cette tendance avec réserve puisqu'il y a eu confusion quant à la 
classification du cannabis. Le profil national des clients des centres de traitement fixe à 45 % 
environ le pourcentage des femmes clientes, alors que des données antérieures du SRAT 
l'établissent plutôt à 41 %.<P>
Comme toujours, la majorité des toxicomanes en traitement ont entre 25 et 34 ans, les hommes 
étant légèrement plus nombreux dans les catégories d'âge plus avancé. Il est intéressant de noter 
qu'au fil du temps, les proportions de patients hommes et femmes se sont sensiblement rapprochées 
dans les groupes plus âgés. Selon des données antérieures du SRAT, le nombre des hommes 
dépasse de loin celui des femmes.(31,32)  Cette situation indique peut-être d'importantes 
tendances spécifiques au sexe. Selon une première hypothèse, les centres de traitement se 
feraient plus conviviaux à l'égard des femmes ou les préjugés envers les femmes désireuses de se 
faire traiter auraient disparu ou diminué. Une seconde hypothèse prétend, bien sûr, que plus de 
femmes que jamais ont besoin d'être traitées. Mais lorsque l'on examine la ventilation par région, il 
devient aussi évident que l'écart entre les taux de participation des hommes et des femmes rétrécit 
au fur et à mesure que l'on progresse vers l'ouest.(33)<P>
L'exception qui ressort le plus de cet ensemble de données du SRAT est l'écart marquant les deux 
sexes en Alberta, tendance absente dans les précédents ensembles.<P>
<H2>Correction du problème</H2>
Oublions un instant le problème même pour nous pencher sur les facteurs susceptibles d'offrir une 
protection. Les communautés qui prônent des règles de conduite bien définies sur l'abus d'alcool et 
de drogue obtiennent des résultats nettement meilleurs que les autres.(40)  Les lignes directrices de 
la communauté O'Chiese sur la sobriété de ses membres(41) incitent en tout premier lieu ses 
dirigeants à s'abstenir de toute toxicomanie. Il est clair que certains chefs autochtones acceptent ce 
rôle modèle et s'inscrivent même à des traitements en groupe.(42)  Les loisirs, qu'il s'agisse de 
sports ou de passe-temps, constituent une certaine muraille contre les modes de vie abusifs.(13,43)  
Les cultures et les familles fortes sont tous des facteurs associés à une vie exempte de 
drogue.(13,43,44)  Le bonheur d'accomplir un travail utile réduit également le risque de 
toxicomanie.(44)<P>
Les mesures de prévention primaire ont permis de cerner plusieurs objectifs en ce qui concerne les 
problèmes associés à la consommation excessive, notamment la personne, la communauté et les 
substances spécifiques.(45)  Il importe d'intégrer aux futures démarches de prévention la famille, 
puisque celle-ci tient un rôle majeur et fait partie intégrante de l'intervention de traitement(46) et 
constitue enfin le meilleur gage de succès de la réadaptation du toxicomane à long terme.(47) Les 
interventions de traitement qui semblent le mieux porter fruit sont toujours celles qui favorisent le 
renforcement de la personne, axé sur le développement intérieur (c'est le cas des collectivités qui 
dirigent le processus de guérison de leurs membres et qui puisent dans les ressources internes et 
extérieures selon les besoins) et l'harmonisation du physique, du mental, de l'affectif et du 
spirituel.(48,49)<P>
<H2>Recommandations pour la recherche 
future</H2>
Le présent chapitre reprend, il est vrai, de l'information déjà parue dans des profils antérieurs de la 
toxicomanie chez les Autochtones,(50,51) mais il vise à apporter un <I>éclairage</I> nouveau, à 
examiner des données plus récentes et les comparer, au besoin, aux tendances antérieures. Les 
données fournies dans cet ouvrage et la documentation antérieure comportent des limitations, mais 
il demeure néanmoins difficile de justifier un examen épidémiologique plus détaillé (sauf peut-être 
pour les Métis, au regard desquels on possède peu d'information sur la santé). Il existe 
indiscutablement un problème de toxicomanie socialement et physiquement dévastateur au sein de 
certaines communautés autochtones. Or la question majeure et fonctionnelle qu'il convient de se 
poser est de savoir «lesquelles et pourquoi». Pour ce qui est du développement de programmes et 
de politiques de portée nationale, certains principes de base ressortent clairement. Les enfants 
autochtones sont extrêmement vulnérables, non seulement à la toxicomanie mais aussi, de façon 
plus alarmante, à ses terribles conséquences. Le tabac, l'alcool, le cannabis et les solvants sont les 
substances qui entraînent le plus d'excès de consommation, et la consommation excessive est à son 
plus fort là où l'on souffre de pauvreté, d'isolement, d'un manque d'estime, de structures familiales 
fragiles, de dynamiques dysfonctionnelles, ainsi que d'antécédents personnels en matière d'abus 
physiques, sexuels et émotifs.(52,53)<P>
La toxicomanie au sein des collectivités revêt des aspects quelque peu différents de ceux observés 
au sujet des populations canadiennes en général. La polarisation de la consommation d'alcool est 
toujours plus marquée entre les collectivités présentant des conditions structurelles semblables. Il 
est sûrement utile, si nous devons trouver une solution au problème, de poursuivre notre recherche 
afin de saisir pourquoi des sujets qui vivent en principe dans des conditions semblables ne 
succombent pas tous à la toxicomanie.<P>
Soulignons enfin, et c'est peut-être là le point le plus important, qu'il existe aussi des écarts 
considérables dans les profils de la toxicomanie, selon la région et la collectivité, et potentiellement 
selon le groupe autochtone. Dans les collectivités fortement touchées par la toxicomanie, les faits 
tendent à démontrer que les caractéristiques de la collectivité,(52) les facteurs socio-économiques et 
le mode de vie(54) contribuent de façon significative à la consommation de drogue et à ses 
conséquences. La recherche future devrait donc en particulier s'efforcer de répondre aux questions 
suivantes :<P>
1.  Quelles sont les différences structurelles entre les collectivités qui sont relativement exemptes de 
problèmes de toxicomanie et celles qui sont absolument dévastées par ces problèmes?<P>
2.  Quelles sont les différences entre les profils de consommation de drogue des groupes 
autochtones et ceux des groupes canadiens lorsque les facteurs socio-économiques sont sous 
contrôle?<P>
3.  Quelles sont les différences familiales et psychologiques entre les gros consommateurs d'alcool 
et les abstinents d'un même milieu?<P>
4.  Quelles sont les corrélatifs de l'abstinence chez les Indiens, les Inuit et les Métis et comment 
peut-on les mettre en valeur dans le contexte du développement familial et 
communautaire?<P>
Il serait <I>infiniment</I> plus utile à l'avenir d'axer la recherche sur la découverte de solutions, 
et de tenter ainsi, par une évaluation rigoureuse, de cerner le problème, puis de prendre des 
initiatives originales en vue de résoudre le problème en prenant soin d'assurer que les solutions 
trouvées soient transférables d'une collectivité à une autre. Quoiqu'il en soit, il importe de veiller à 
ce que la recherche sur la toxicomanie tienne pleinement compte de la situation réelle des Indiens, 
des Inuit et des Métis. Seul un partenariat avec ces derniers, là où ils détiennent le contrôle, et qui 
permette de diriger et de développer les recherches en fonction du contexte pourra garantir un tel 
résultat. Certes, des résultats heureux ont été obtenus grâce aux groupes d'entraide là où ils 
existent, mais les réalisations et l'essor de ces groupes sont presque totalement ignorés à l'extérieur 
de leurs milieux d'action. Or il faudra bien, dans le cadre des futurs travaux de recherche, faire 
connaître ces réalisations.<P>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>
Les enfants autochtones sont considérablement plus vulnérables à l'usage de la drogue et à ses 
terribles conséquences que l'ensemble des enfants canadiens.  On dénombre proportionnellement un 
plus grand nombre d'adultes ayant suivi un traitement dans les provinces de l'ouest, dont la 
majorité avaient entre 25 et 34 ans. Les Indiens et les Inuit, surtout les 15 à 35 ans, courent un plus 
grand risque que leurs homologues de l'Amérique du Nord de décéder d'une cause associée à un 
abus de drogue. Et bien que ce même risque soit nettement plus bas chez la femme autochtone que 
chez l'homme autochtone, de nombreuses données suggèrent qu'elle se rapproche davantage de 
l'homme autochtone que des autres femmes en matière de consommation de drogue.<P>
Il existe une plus grande polarisation dans les habitudes de consommation d'alcool chez les 
membres des collectivités ainsi qu'une importante variation entre les collectivités. Les normes 
d'appui social semblent constamment reliées à la consommation chez les deux sexes et dans toutes 
les catégories d'âge. Mais dans une bonne partie des recherches ici mentionnées, les effets de 
l'acculturation et de la situation socio-économique n'ont pas été vérifiés. Nous savons que la 
culture, la famille et la répartition de la richesse occupent une place importante dans la guérison du 
toxicomane et la protection contre la toxicomanie, mais si l'on veut résoudre le dilemme, il convient 
de se montrer tout particulièrement attentif et sensible aux besoins des Métis, des Inuit et des 
Indiens, c'est-à-dire à ce qui les rend résistants, et de façon plus urgente encore, aux changements 
structurels nécessaires à la recherche collective d'une guérison. <P>

<B>par Tess Radford</B><P>
L'impact des communautés bien portantes sur la consommation de drogues et d'alcool et la nécessité de 
faire participer les jeunes forment les deux grands thèmes de la Semaine de sensibilisation aux drogues 
(SSD) et de la Semaine nationale de sensibilisation aux toxicomanies (SNST) pour 1995.<P><BR CLEAR=left>
<H2>Territoires du Nord-Ouest</H2>
Les Territoires célébreront la Semaine nationale de sensibilisation aux toxicomanies par des marches de 
sobriété, des danses sans alcool, des causeries radiophoniques et divers rassemblements véhiculant le 
slogan «Join the Circle» (joignez-vous au cercle). Les organisateurs ont en outre lancé un concours 
territorial visant à désigner une mascotte.<P>
<I>Contacter : Andy Sibbald, Dept. of Social Services, Alcohol, Drugs and Mental Health Services,

7706.</I><P>
<H2>Yukon</H2>
Le Yukon a choisi de consacrer la SNST aux jeunes et retenu le slogan «Live in the Light» (vivons dans la 
lumière). L'inauguration de la Semaine aura lieu le lundi 20 novembre, à Whitehorse, et sera marquée par 
la formation d'un cercle dans le hall de l'assemblée législative. Parmi les activités prévues, notons la 
tenue d'expositions dans divers centres d'achats, le tirage d'un sweatshirt de la SNST, la présentation 
dans trois communautés du programme local de rôles à émuler, et un dîner libre de toute drogue au 
Kwanlin Dunn Village, le mercredi 22 novembre.<P>
Le clou de la Semaine sera une con-férence consacrée aux jeunes, à Whitehorse, le vendredi 24 novembre. 
L'école de danse locale ouvrira la conférence, et  un groupe de théâtre présentera la pièce «You can't get 
away from you» (on n'échappe pas à soi même). Le conférencier invité est le motivateur Bill Gordon, qui 
traitera de l'estime de soi et du choix de modes de vie sains.<P>

6118 -6e Ave., Whitehorse (YT) Y1A 2C6. Tél. (403) 667-5777; fax (403) 668-4818.</I><P>
<H2>Colombie-Britannique</H2>
La province a retenu comme thème de la Semaine de sensibilisation aux drogues, la communauté, et 
comme slogan, «You make a difference» (vous faites la différence). Les organisateurs comptent inciter les 
communautés à célébrer les activités qui favorisent des choix de vie saine et éloignent de l'alcool et des 
autres drogues.<P>
La Semaine sera inaugurée par le ministre de la Santé. Les maires et les conseils municipaux seront 
invités à proclamer officiellement la Semaine dans leurs juridictions respectives.<P>
Plusieurs entreprises participent à la promotion de la SSD, dont McDonald's, Island Farms, 7-Eleven, 
Canada Safeway, Shoppers Drug Mart et Overwaitea Foods, soit en reproduisant le logo et le slogan 
officiels de la Semaine dans leur publicité et leurs produits d'emballage. La Commission des alcools de la 
province a pour sa part choisi de faire imprimer le logo sur 260 000 sacs et de suspendre l'affiche de la 
SSD dans tous ses magasins.<P>

<H2>Alberta</H2>
Le slogan de la SNST en Alberta cette année sera «Going somewhere... it's your choice» (réussir... c'est 
votre affaire). Le thème retenu : des choix sains pour une vie saine. De son côté, l'AADAC (commission 
albertaine antidrogue) vise la population en général et a produit un calendrier artistique à l'intention des 
écoles et des groupes communautaires. Elle collabore étroitement avec le Bureau de la prévention de la 
violence familiale et distribuera des répertoires téléphoniques de poche aux élèves et deux dépliants 
expliquant le lien entre la violence familiale et la toxicomanie.<P>
Le bureau de l'AADAC à Calgary, Santé Canada et divers parrains du secteur privé publient 
conjointement une vidéo intitulée «Ten feet tall and bullet proof» (haut comme une tour et à l'épreuve des 
balles). La vidéo a été produite par un groupe de jeunes surnommé «Generation Warriors» (les guerriers 
du renouvellement),  à la suite de la mort d'un enfant de la rue. Il prévoit également des séances de 
patinage libre pour la famille et des journées portes ouvertes. A Edmonton, l'AADAC prépare une 
campagne postale et distribue aux services sociaux et dans le milieu du travail des trousses d'information 
adaptées aux  leurs besoins.<P>

<H2>Saskatchewan</H2>
Pour la SSD 1995, la Saskatchewan cible de nouveau la famille et les communautés et conserve le slogan 
de l'an passé : «Family and community working together to be drug-free» (coopération famille-collectivité 
pour un milieu sans drogue).<P>
Le samedi 18 novembre, le mouvement Élans/Croix pourpre occupera un char du défilé annuel de la 
Coupe Grey, où il attirera l'attention sur les drogues. L'inauguration provinciale de la SSD aura lieu le 
lundi 20 novembre, à LaRonge, où diverses activités se dérouleront toute la journée. Le Médaillon 
d'excellence du CCLAT sera décerné au groupe SADD (les élèves contre l'alcool au volant) le mercredi 
22 novembre, à Prince Albert, à l'occasion du déjeuner communautaire annuel de la SSD. Les 
organisateurs veilleront ensuite à ce que toutes les sections locales de SADD accueillent tour à tour le 
Médaillon. Chaque personne mise en nomination recevra une plaque commémorant sa contribution à la 
lutte antidrogue.<P>

<H2>Manitoba</H2>
Le Manitoba a adopté comme slogan de la SSD, «Lifestyle choices--High on life, not on drugs» (Moi 
j'aime la vie, pas les drogues). Le thème de la Semaine insiste sur le choix de modes de vie sains et les 
alternatives aux toxicomanies. Des trousses d'information ont été envoyées à 1 000 écoles et à 500 
communautés.<P>
L'inauguration de la Semaine aura lieu le lundi 20 novembre, à Brandon. Le ministre de la Santé signera 
alors une proclamation, et un rassemblement sera tenu à l'hôtel de ville, sous la bannière «Keep the circle 
strong» (maintenons la force du cercle).<P>

<H2>Ontario</H2>
Le Partenariat SSD de l'Ontario rallie seize organismes s'occupant de divers programmes de 
sensibilisation aux drogues tout au long de l'année dans la province. Ciblant les communautés, il a choisi 
comme thème «Les communautés humaines trouvent les moyens» et retenu le slogan «Croyez en vous--
vivez sans drogues».<P>
D'une part, on incite les pizzerias à apposer le logo frappé du slogan sur leurs cartons de livraison et, 
d'autre part, on a remis aux stations d'essence Esso et aux bibliothèques municipales des sacs de 
polyéthylène affichant le logo et diverses scènes de stratégies d'action communautaire dont s'inspirer. Des 
macarons géants frappés du logo ont été envoyés aux groupes communautaires qui devraient à leur tour 
les distribuer aux brigadiers scolaires pour qu'ils les portent durant la SSD.<P>
Le mardi 21 novembre, de 13 heures à 15 heures, la Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie (ARF) 
tiendra gratuitement une téléconférence consacrée à l'importance du rôle de la famille dans la prévention 
de l'alcool et des drogues chez les jeunes.<P>
Le Partenariat organise son propre programme de prix et sollicite, en 1995, la mise en nomination de 
groupes communautaires. Les prix seront décernés durant la SSD. Le Partenariat s'inspirera des 
témoignages recueillis au moyen des formulaires de mise en nomination pour produire une brochure sur 
l'action communautaire.<P>

<H2>Québec</H2>
Au Québec, la Semaine de sensibilisation aux drogues porte essentiellement sur l'amélioration des 
communications entre les adultes et les jeunes. Deux slogans ont été retenus : «A ses yeux vous êtes 
important», qui s'adresse aux parents, et «Mes parents ont déjà eu mon âge ... ils comprennent mes désirs, 
mes peines, mes rêves», à l'intention des jeunes.<P>
On a pour l'occasion publié un dépliant recto-verso qui présente une série de questions s'adressant sur une 
face aux parents et sur l'autre, aux jeunes. Les deux groupes y sont invités à coter la qualité de leurs 
communications. Le dépliant a été distribué dans toutes les pharmacies de la province, avec l'appui de 
l'Ordre des pharmaciens. On a en outre publié un livret de 20 pages sur le même thème à l'intention des 
intervenants en toxicomanie. Ceux-ci y verront comment structurer l'information en vue d'améliorer les 
communications.<P>
On a en outre produit deux affiches, l'une consacrée aux adultes et l'autre aux jeunes, que l'on a distribué 
dans les écoles.<P>

<H2>Nouveau-Brunswick</H2>
«Working together for healthy communities» (travaillons ensemble pour des communautés saines) est le 
slogan de la SSD. Les Prix des «stars communautaires» seront décernés, le lundi 20 novembre, à des 
particuliers pouvant servir de modèle et menant une vie saine. Partout dans la province, les services de 
traitement tiendront des journées portes ouvertes, les écoles, des concours d'affiche, et les stations radios, 
des causeries, en vue de sensibiliser la population aux drogues. La presse locale et communautaire sera 
invitée à publier des articles ou à produire des encarts afin de mieux faire connaître les dossiers de la 
drogue.<P>
Les organisateurs profiteront de la SSD pour lancer un calendrier de sensibilisation (bilingue), dont 
chaque mois portera sur un thème différent; ainsi, janvier 1996 mettra en valeur la Semaine nationale 
antitabagisme, avril le jeu, et juillet la sécurité sur l'eau.<P>

<H2>Ile-du-Prince-Edouard</H2>
L'Ile-du-Prince-Edouard consacre la Semaine de sensibilisation aux drogues de 1995 aux jeunes. Plusieurs 
organismes cibleront  à cette occasion la consommation d'alcool et de drogues illicites. Entre autres 
activités, les organisateurs ont prévu des présentations publiques, des expositions dans les centres d'achat 
et un encart spécial dans l'édition du samedi du quotidien The Guardian, (le quotidien qui «couvre l'île 
telle une rosée»). L'encart soulignera les conséquences de la consommation d'alcool chez les mineurs et 
prodiguera des conseils aux parents. La SRC consacrera pour sa part une émission aux jeunes, aux parents 
et au mouvement SADD. La SSD servira en outre de cadre au lancement d'un programme de lutte contre 
l'alcool au volant.<P>

<H2>Nouvelle-Ecosse</H2>
Slogan de la SSD : «Together we make the difference» (ensemble, nous faisons la différence). Thème 
central : la communauté. Sont prévus dans les cinq régions de la province, des cérémonies du lever du 
drapeau, divers défilés, ainsi que des expositions spéciales dans les centres d'achat. Durant toute la 
Semaine, le slogan et le logo seront très visibles apparaissant sur des panneaux en bordure des routes, des 
T-shirts et d'autres articles promotionnels, dont des porte-clefs et aimants de réfrigérateur, déjà 
distribués.<P>

<H2>Terre-Neuve et Labrador</H2>
Cette région axe ses activités de la SSD 1995 sur la famille et la communauté, et a retenu comme slogan, 
«FACT», acronyme de son thème officiel (Families and communities together).<P>
Les organisateurs travaillent avec les médias dans le but de lancer un concours provincial sous forme de 
jeu-questionnaire radiophonique. Il existe actuellement un concours quotidien de cinq jours, dans le cadre 
duquel on remet aux gagnants des gobelets de la SSD. A la fin de la semaine, le grand gagnant, choisi au 
hasard parmi tous les gagnants à ce jour, se méritera un sweatshirt de la SSD. Les organisateurs ont aussi 
produit, de concert avec NTV/CTV, une publicité télévisée sur la sensibilisation aux drogues, et cherchent 
actuellement des sociétés commanditaires en vue de pouvoir acheter du temps d'antenne durant toute 
l'année.<P>
Par ailleurs, l'alliance des jeunes (Allied Youth) parraine son septième jeu-questionnaire annuel, et plus 
de 6 000 trousses d'information sur la SSD on été diffusées.<P>

<H2>Nechi Institute</H2>
«Honouring our youth» (honorons nos jeunes). Tel est le thème qui marquera la septième marche annuelle 
pour la sobriété qui se tiendra le lundi 20 novembre, à Edmonton. Celle-ci est organisée de concert avec 
l'AADAC, partenaire du Nechi Institute pour une deuxième année.<P>
Etant donné que la mascotte, «Sober Bear» (l'Ourson sobre), se retire à compter de cette année, le Nechi 
Institute tient un concours en vue de baptiser la mascotte remplaçante, un petit de «Sober Bear». Les 
enfants de la première à la sixième année fréquentant les écoles des réserves sont également invités à 
s'inscrire au concours. Le gagnant et un adulte accompagnant gagneront un séjour à Edmonton, pendant 
lequel ils seront logés au West Edmonton Mall.<P>
Environ 1 000 communautés et organismes ont transmis une déclaration d'intention à l'institut, 
soulignant les activités envisagées, dont les suivantes :<P>
<UL>
<LI>la population du quartier Sagmok Anishnawbek, à Massey (Ontario), débutera la SNST par un feu 
sacré qui brûlera toute la semaine; elle prévoit en outre une rencontre éducative et une danse pour les 
alcooliques anonymes, un concours de coloriage et une exposition d'une journée des ressources locales;
<LI>les jeunes de la bande Little Shuswap, à Chase (C.-B.), souligneront la SNST en peignant un

Le Secrétariat de la SCA a distribué des calendriers de poche aux membres des comités organisateurs 
provinciaux et territoriaux. Le calendrier, qui va de novembre 1995 à octobre 1996, porte le slogan 
«Relevons le défi». Le Secrétariat a en outre produit des «slammers», rondelles frappées du même slogan 
sur un côté et du slogan «Au Naturel» de l'autre. Les rondelles, utilisées dans un jeu qui fait actuellement 
fureur auprès des jeunes, ont été distribuées aux infirmières de la santé publique à qui l'on a demandé de 
contribuer aux programmes de sensibilisation aux drogues dans les écoles et de remettre ces rondelles en 
guise de récompenses lors des concours de coloriage, d'affiche ou d'essai.<P>
Un député s'adressera à la Chambre des communes pour rappeler la Semaine de sensibilisation aux 
drogues et la Semaine nationale de sensibilisation aux toxicomanies. On organise, par ailleurs une 
présentation conjointe avec le secteur des douanes de Revenu Canada, à laquelle participeront des chiens 
détecteurs.<P>

<TITLE>Prix d'excellence du CCLAT pour l'année 1995</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<IMG SRC="/daw95f.gif" WIDTH=511 HEIGHT=217 ALT="Renaissance d'un quartier"><P>
<H2>Mise en nomination par l'ex-mairesse de 
Toronto, June Rowlands, l'association des 
résidants d'Alexandra Park reçoit <BR>
le Prix d'excellence du CCLAT pour l'année 
1995</H2>
La communauté peut constituer une véritable force lorsque l'ensemble de ses membres s'unissent dans une 
lutte commune. Dans le cas de l'association des résidants d'Alexandra Park (Alexandra Park Residents 
Association--APRA), à Toronto, il s'agissait de lutter contre le crime et la violence reliés à la drogue. En 
quatre ans, l'APRA a reconverti un quartier de logements subventionnés du centre-ville devenu le fief des 
trafiquants de drogues en une vibrante communauté, où les résidants de tous âges sont aujourd'hui fiers de 
participer à la vie communautaire. Le témoignage suivant (abrégé faute d'espace) et une lettre signée par 
l'ex-mairesse de Toronto, June Rowlands, accompagnaient le formulaire de mise en nomination soumis 
par le comité de travail municipal sur les stupéfiants :<P>
«En 1990, irrités par la situation de leur quartier, les résidants d'Alexandra Park ont décidé 
d'entreprendre une série de mesures de redressement. Ils ont, comme première étape, renouvelé le comité 
directeur de l'association. Sous la direction du président Sonny Atkinson, l'APRA a par la suite sollicité 
l'appui des élus locaux, de la police, des établissements scolaires, de la Commission de logement de la 
communauté urbaine de Toronto (CLCUT), des Services urbains et d'autres organismes locaux.<P>
«Se joignant à la CLCUT et aux autorités de la Ville de Toronto, les résidants ont veillé à faire disparaître 
tous les murs et bosquets faisant écran aux activités des trafiquants de drogues et à améliorer l'éclairage 
du quartier. Ils ont également veillé, de concert avec la police et la CLCUT, à se débarrasser des locataires 
exploitants de piqueries et à assurer une patrouille régulière de manière à décourager les gangs de 
trafiquants. Collaborant avec la Ville et la CLCUT, ils ont parrainé un programme spécialement destiné 
aux jeunes. Les jeunes qui s'étaient auparavant vus refusés l'accès aux installations récréatives locales ont 
été formés et investis de la planification et de la gestion de leurs propres activités. Jusque-là exclus de la 
vie communautaire, ces jeunes en font aujourd'hui partie intégrante. Ils ont bénéficié de la priorité lors de 
l'allocation des locaux du centre communautaire. Non seulement ont-ils été chargés de la gestion de leurs 
propres programmes récréatifs au sein de leur établissement scolaire local, mais ils sont aussi devenus 
membres du conseil de l'APRA.<P>
«Toutes ces démarches ont pris un certain temps, mais leurs résultats ont profondément modifié la 
communauté. Les résidants semblent plus amicaux et détendus. Les gangs de trafiquants de drogues ont 
quitté le quartier, ainsi que la plupart des piqueries. Les résidants négocient aujourd'hui avec la CLCUT, 
afin de faire convertir leurs unités de logement en coopérative. Grâce à leur sage exploitation des 
ressources disponibles et à leur diligence, ils ont totalement reconverti Alexandra Park en une 
communauté responsable de ses jeunes, en mesure de cultiver chez eux d'autres intérêts que la drogue et 
l'alcool».<P>
<H1>Lauréats <BR>
du Médaillon d'excellence <BR>
1995 du CCLAT</H1>
Le programme des Médaillons d'excellence du CCLAT établit maintenant deux catégories de 
récipiendaires : les groupes et les particuliers. L'année 1995 étant consacrée aux groupes, les particuliers 
seront mis à l'honneur en 1996.<P>
<H2>Des jeunes à la tête dans trois 
provinces</H2>
Le tragique impact de l'alcool au volant sur les communautés canadiennes se reflète dans la diversité des 
organismes mis sur pied pour combattre le problème. Même si des groupes tels MADD, SADD, et TADD 
peuvent différer à plusieurs titres, ils visent néanmoins un même objectif, soit de réduire ou de supprimer 
les blessures et les pertes de vie inutiles, imputables aux conducteurs en état d'ébriété.<P>
<H4>TERRE-NEUVE : Section locale du mouvement MADD (les 
mères contre les conducteurs aux facultés affaiblies) pour la région 
de Happy Valley-Goose Bay (Labrador) </H4>
La section locale de MADD (les mères contre les conducteurs aux facultés affaiblies) pour la région de 
Happy Valley-Goose Bay (Labrador) est devenue active en 1991, après qu'une jeune fille ait été tuée par 
un conducteur aux facultés affaiblies. Dans sa lutte visant à modifier la législation sur l'alcool au volant à 
Terre-Neuve et au Labrador, le groupe a obtenu la révocation du permis de conduire pendant 24 heures 
pour les conducteurs présentant une alcoolémie d'au moins 0,05 mg, l'obligation pour les premiers 
contrevenants de suivre un programme d'information sur la conduite en état d'ébriété, et l'évaluation des 
titulaires d'une seconde contravention.<P>
Grâce au mouvement MADD, la communauté a participé à de multiples activités, notamment la 
campagne du ruban rouge (lancée par le premier ministre Jean Chrétien alors qu'il était chef de 
l'opposition officielle), un concours d'affiches de Noël, une vigile à  la chandelle à la mémoire des 
victimes des conducteurs en état d'ébriété, ainsi qu'un défilé automobile annuel tenu à l'occasion de la 
Semaine de sensibilisation aux drogues. Le groupe a aussi créé un programme de soutien à l'intention des 
familles des victimes de l'alcool au volant.<P>
<H4>ILE-DU-PRINCE-EDOUARD : Sections locales de SADD 
(les élèves contre l'alcool au volant) de l'ecole secondaire Colonel 
Gray et l'école secondaire rurale de Charlottetown</H4>
En Ile-du-Prince-Edouard, deux lauréats se sont mérités le médaillon du CCLAT. Il s'agit de deux 
sections locales du mouvement SADD (les élèves contre l'alcool au volant), l'une de l'école secondaire 
Colonel Gray et l'autre de l'école secondaire rurale de Charlottetown. Actives depuis les années 80, les 
deux sections dirigent plusieurs activités scolaires, commençant par la présentation automnale annuelle 
d'un spectacle audiovisuel de motivation, soit une production d'une heure sur les toxicomanies, projetée 
sur écrans géants (11 pi x 13 pi), et mettant en valeur la pratique de modes de vie positifs. Toutes deux ont 
aussi effectué des levées de fonds pour en défrayer la production.<P>
Au sein de la communauté, les groupes SADD procèdent, de concert avec la GRC, à des contrôles routiers 
d'information, organisent le marathon annuel McDonald au bénéfice de SADD, rédigent des mes-sages 
radiophoniques contre l'alcool au volant pour la période des Fêtes, et tiennent une campagne du ruban 
rouge. Cette campagne sert à la fois à mieux sensibiliser la population et à recueillir des fonds pour 
diverses activités spéciales telles la participation aux conférences provinciales de SADD. En décembre 
dernier, les deux sections ont obtenu la couverture télévisée, aux heures de grande écoute, de l'attache des 
rubans rouges aux poteaux téléphoniques entre les deux écoles.<P>
<H4>MANITOBA : Mouvement TADD (les adolescents contre 
l'alcool au volant) du Collège de Minnedosa</H4>
La section de TADD (les adolescents contre l'alcool au volant) du Collège de Minnedosa forme un groupe 
si populaire que plus de 12 pour 100 des élèves fréquentant ce petit collège manitobain en font partie. Le 
calendrier des activités fort rempli de TADD, sur le plan scolaire et communautaire, prévoit la tenue de 
plusieurs événements durant la Semaine de sensibilisation aux drogues (SSD) en novembre, dont 
l'arrestation fictive d'un conducteur aux facultés affaiblies et son procès, un déjeuner annuel aux crêpes, et 
une exposition sur la rue principale de voitures démolies.<P>
TADD est aussi actif lors de conférences et d'événements d'envergure provinciale, par exemple le Jour 
des morts. A cette occasion, les élèves s'habillent en noir, à la mémoire des quelque cinquante 
manitobains qui décèdent chaque année par suite de collisions causées par l'alcool. Ils participent aux 
activités scolaires, mais à titre de personnes «décédées», ils ne parlent pas, ni ne font aucune intervention 
auprès de leurs pairs et des enseignants. Sur une note plus gaie, le groupe TADD a produit et distribué 
1 700 dépliants faisant la promotion de recettes de punch non alcooliques lors du dernier Noël.<P>
<H4>SASKATCHEWAN : Mouvement SADD (les élèves contre 
l'alcool au volant)</H4>
Le mouvement SADD (les élèves contre l'alcool au volant) de la Saskatchewan est un groupe formidable 
qui regroupe 2 300 membres et 182 sections locales enregistrées. Depuis 1985-1986, plus de 15 000 
jeunes en ont fait partie. En 1990, le groupe a commencé à user de son influence pour exercer des 
pressions en vue de modifier la législation provinciale sur l'alcool au volant et a récemment obtenu la 
reconnaissance politique de ses deux grands principes : ne pas particulariser les jeunes pour des mesures 
spécifiques non appliquées aux adultes; reconnaître que l'affaiblissement des facultés commence avec le 
premier verre.<P>
SADD a été mis en nomination conjointement par les cadres du ministère des transports de la 
Saskatchewan, le bureau d'assurance de la Saskatchewan, les clubs Kiwanis, la GRC, le conseil de 
sécurité de la Saskatchewan et la Banque royale. L'exposé d'accompagnement fait valoir le «courage 
personnel, l'action et l'attitude positives» des membres du groupe. Il fait par ailleurs observer que les 
jeunes qui choisissent de ne pas consommer d'alcool ou d'intervenir en vue d'empêcher les gens de 
conduire en état d'ébriété doivent souvent surmonter les pressions négatives exercées par les pairs.<P>
<H2>Education et prévention...d'un océan à 
l'autre</H2>
Les récipiendaires du Médaillon du CCLAT pour la Nouvelle-Ecosse, la Colombie-Britannique et le 
Yukon ont été sélectionnés pour avoir contribué à mieux faire connaître les problèmes associés à l'alcool 
et aux drogues et conçu des stratégies de prévention.<P>
<H4>NOUVELLE-ECOSSE : Comité de Yarmouth pour la 
sensibilisation et la prévention en matière de drogues (Yarmouth 
Committee on Drug Awareness and Prevention)</H4>
Le comité de Yarmouth sur la sensibilisation et la prévention en matière de drogues (Yarmouth 
Committee on Drug Awareness and Prevention) a été créé à la fin des années 70, alors que ses membres 
bénévoles avaient mené une fructueuse campagne en vue d'assurer à cette communauté de la Nouvelle-
Ecosse des services de traitement en toxicomanie. Misant sur l'éducation communautaire, le comité a 
formé divers partenariats avec les services provinciaux de toxicomanie (Drug Dependency Services) et 
plusieurs autres organismes de bénévoles et de professionnels, dont notamment les associations locales 
parents-écoles, la bande indienne de l'Acadie (un conseiller autochtone en toxicomanie fait partie du 
comité), la GRC, et la direction provinciale de la santé.<P>
Au cours des récentes années, le comité a monté et présenté une série de sept émissions sur les 
toxicomanies à la télévision communautaire locale, a  développé un ensemble de ressources éducatives sur 
le SAF et les EAF dans le cadre du programme de soutien communautaire de la Stratégie canadienne 
antidrogue (SCA), a appuyé les sections locales du mouvement KADD (les enfants contre l'alcool au 
volant) dans trois écoles, et a formé un comité directeur chargé de mettre sur pied un centre de jour pour  
jeunes afin de combler le besoin d'un tel centre.<P>
<H4>COLOMBIE-BRITANNIQUE : Mouvement T/O ADAPT 
(Thompson/Okanagan Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention 
Teams) (Equipes de prévention des toxicomanies de Thompson-
Okanagan)</H4>
Depuis 1986, les équipes du mouvement T/O ADAPT (équipes de prévention des toxicomanies de 
Thompson-Okanagan), lauréates du Médaillon pour la Colombie-Britannique, ont favorisé les mesures de 
prévention de maintes manières. L'an dernier, grâce à deux subventions reçues dans le cadre de la 
Stratégie canadienne antidrogue, elles ont, en dix-huit mois, formé plusieurs petites communautés en 
évaluation des risques et des ressources, et entrepris le développement d'un réseau informatisé devant 
relier entre eux les divers groupes voués à la résolution des problèmes de drogues et d'alcool et à la 
prévention.<P>
Dans le cadre du programme d'action communautaire de prévention de la Stratégie, le groupe «T/O 
ADAPT» a parrainé avec succès diverses séances de formation à l'intention des groupes cibles, 
notamment les parents, les membres de groupes de travail et les jeunes intervenants de première ligne. Il a 
en outre participé aux activités de la Semaine de sensibilisation aux drogues, en novembre dernier, faisant 
don de T-shirts marqués du slogan «Vous faites la différence» à quatorze communautés de la région.<P>
<H4>YUKON : GRC, section de Beaver Creek</H4>
Au Yukon, le Médaillon revient à une équipe de la GRC stationnée à Beaver Creek et mise en nomination 
par le centre infirmier de Beaver Creek.  Le justificatif de mise en nomination met tout particulièrement à 
l'honneur le caporal Larry Kavanagh et le constable Ralph Cardinal, qui ont fortement contribué à 
dissiper les inquiétudes concernant la santé et les problèmes de drogues au sein de la communauté. Tous 
deux s'occupent de distribuer de l'information sur les drogues dans les écoles locales, grâce aux ressources 
mises à leur disposition par le responsable du programme de sensibilisation aux drogues de la GRC à 
Whitehorse. Ils collaborent étroitement par ailleurs avec la première nation White River à Beaver Creek, 
veillant à ce que les aînés utilisent leurs médicaments correctement et s'efforçant de promouvoir le 
développement d'un centre de traitement pour alcooliques dans un environnement naturel.<P>
Les deux agents interviennent aussi à titre de bénévoles dans les activités sportives et autres activités 
récréatives de la communauté, convaincu qu'un mode de vie actif est le meilleur remède contre l'ennui et 
du même coup une protection des jeunes contre les dangers de l'alcool et des drogues.<P>
<H2>Traitement et réadaptation . . . des groupes 
à haut risque</H2>
Au Québec et en Alberta, le Médaillon a été remis à deux organismes offrant des services de traitement 
aux jeunes et aux femmes souffrant de toxicomanies.<P>
<H4>QUEBEC : Centres Jean Lapointe pour adolescent(e)s</H4>
Les Centres Jean Lapointe pour adolescent(e)s existent depuis 1989 à Québec et depuis 1992 à Montréal. 
L'artiste de spectacle Jean Lapointe, qui a volontiers accepté de prêter son nom à la Maison Jean 
Lapointe, à sa création en 1982, après son propre rétablissement de l'alcoolisme, a la faveur de tous les 
Québécois. Le téléthon qu'il organise chaque année, afin de recueillir des fonds pour le traitement des 
toxicomanes et des alcooliques, a un impact médiatique exceptionnel et a considérablement contribué à 
sensibiliser les Québécois aux problèmes de la toxicomanie.<P>
Depuis 1989, plus de 1 300 jeunes ont bénéficié des services offerts aux deux centres, qui assurent 
l'évaluation des sujets, l'aiguillage vers d'autres services, le logement et le suivi. Fait particulier à noter, 
le programme en vigueur permet aux patients de maintenir leurs performances académiques en 
poursuivant leurs études aux centres mêmes, pendant les huit semaines que dure leur thérapie en 
résidence.<P>
<H4>ALBERTA : Association Riverside Villa</H4>
L'association Riverside Villa (Riverside Villa Association), organisme sans but lucratif, fournit un large 
éventail de services spécialisés aux femmes de dix-huit ans et plus souffrant de toxicomanie. L'association 
a établi son premier service de traitement, d'une durée de vingt-huit jours, en 1973, et a créé un second 
service en 1980, dans le but de fournir aux femmes apprenant à composer avec la sobriété à long terme un 
environnement résidentiel sécuritaire.<P>
En 1993, alors que l'on comprimait les budgets malgré la demande croissante de services, il a été décidé 
de procéder à une refonte majeure de l'organisme. Après une certaine opposition initiale interne, 
l'association a fermé l'une des résidences, relogeant tous les patients dans un même établissement, 
développé et mis en oeuvre un programme de traitement entièrement renouvelé, doublé le personnel de 
consultation, assuré le perfectionnement du personnel, et acquis un nouveau centre de traitement 
externe.<P>
<H2>Prix d'excellence<BR>
Sélection du lauréat du CCLAT </H2>
A chaque année, un comité de sélection composé de cinq membres, dont deux provenant du conseil 
d'administration du CCLAT et trois, des services en toxicomanie, et dont les noms sont tirés au hasard, 
est mis sur pied afin de déterminer le lauréat du Prix d'excellence du CCLAT. Les membres ainsi choisis 
doivent représenter des provinces ou territoires différents et s'abstenir de voter pour le candidat de leur 
propre juridiction.<P>
Le comité entame le processus de sélection en juin, aussitôt après la réception et le traitement des mises en 
nomination, et détermine le lauréat en septembre, dans le cadre d'une vidéoconférence. Cette dernière est 
coprésidée par Gary Roberts et Gilles Strasbourg, tous deux du CCLAT.<P>
Le comité de sélection se composait cette année de Brian Wilbur, division de la planification et des 
politiques en matière de toxicomanie, ministère de la Santé de la Nouvelle-Ecosse; de Karen Ferrucio, 
Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie, Bureau régional centre-sud; Leila Campbell, direction des 
programmes, ministère de la Santé de la Saskatchewan; Maggie Hodgson et Jennifer Power, membres du 
conseil d'administration du CCLAT.<P>

<H2>Croissance de la demande 
d'information</H2>
Le Centre national de documentation sur l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies du CCLAT offre deux services 
d'information : le Service d'information générale et, depuis mai 1994, le Service d'information sur le 
syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal (SAF) et sur les effets de l'alcoolisme foetal (EAF), accessible sans frais via 
le 1-800 et financé par le CCLAT, l'Association des brasseurs du Canada, l'Association canadienne des 
distillateurs et Santé Canada. Il faut souvent plusieurs jours de recherche informatisée, de traitement et de 
personnalisation des données pour répondre à  une seule demande, mais en 1994-1995, 40 pour 100 des 2 
000 demandes ont été remplies dans les 24 heures.<P>

<H2>Réseautage et expansion des 
ressources</H2>
Les réseaux d'information représentent un outil-clé pour développer les connaissances dans le domaine  
des toxicomanies. Le réseautage élargit constamment l'accès aux ressources d'information existantes et 
contribue à générer de nouvelles données dans les secteurs où il convient d'en apprendre davantage. De 
leur côté, les réseaux d'intérêt particulier permettent surtout de mieux cerner certaines questions ou 
populations.<P>
<H3>Réseau canadien d'information sur les toxicomanies 
(RCIT)</H3>
A son ouverture, en 1991, le Centre national de documenta-tion du CCLAT disposait d'une collection d'à 
peine 1 000 documents. Mais l'année suivante, la taille de ce fonds documentaire, appelé  le CCSADOCS, 
avait déjà triplé. Avec la création du RCIT, cette même année, naissait une nouvelle base de données, la 
CANBASE, qui regroupe des fiches documentaires de chaque grande bibliothèque spécialisée en 
toxicomanie au Canada. De 1994 à 1995, les deux bases de données ont connu un essor de 12 pour 100, 
surtout attribuable à CANBASE.<P>

Quel que soit le secteur d'étude, les répertoires constituent toujours une source d'information capitale. 
Aussi, le CCLAT tient-il à jour les bases de données de deux vastes répertoires regroupant les 
coordonnées de 3 000 organismes, personnes et programmes du secteur de la toxicomanie. Cette 
information est imprimée tous les deux ans. Les rapports de recherche et les rapports statistiques forment 
une deuxième source d'information indispensable. Le CCLAT produit ainsi chaque année, de concert avec 
la Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie de l'Ontario, un profil statistique (Profil canadien) et a 
collaboré auprès de Santé Canada à la publication de travaux de recherche sur les populations spéciales 
(collection Horizons). En 1994-1995, le CCLAT a diffusé près de 1 000 répertoires et rapports de 
recherche.<P>

En 1994-1995, le CCLAT a produit et diffusé un large éventail de produits d'information spécialisés, dont 
<I><A HREF="/anfre.htm">Action Nouvelles.</A></I> Dans le cadre d'un programme d'évaluation réalisé en 1993, Ekos Research Associates 
Inc. déclarait que plus de gens découvraient le Centre par ce bulletin bimensuel que par tout autre de ses 
produits ou services. Le Centre s'est efforcé de garder les coûts de production d'Action Nouvelles en-deçà 
du seuil de rentabilité, soit en réduisant le budget de près de la moitié et en imposant un modeste droit 
d'abonnement pour recouvrer une partie des coûts d'impression. Son tirage a baissé, mais le bulletin est 
aujourd'hui plus rentable et rejoint un auditoire plus sensible. La plupart des publications suivantes sont 
diffusées à base de recouvrement des frais.<P>

<H2>Un plus vaste rayonnement</H2>
En 1994-1995, l'équipe du CCLAT a largement intensifié son rayonnement, soit par la publication 
d'articles dans plusieurs revues professionnelles, la présentation de communications à maintes rencontres 
internationales, la prestation de cours, et l'octroi de douzaines d'entrevues aux médias. Bien qu'il soit 
tâche difficile que de vouloir mesurer l'impact de l'information sur un auditoire spécialisé, notamment les 
professionnels en toxicomanie, la taille et la catégorie du groupe en fournissent tout de même une 
indication préliminaire. Mais dans le cas de la couverture des masse médias, la tâche revêt alors des 
proportions gigantesques. Aucune tentative n'est donc faite ici en vue d'évaluer le nombre éventuel des 
lecteurs de journaux et des téléspectateurs ayant pu être sensibilisés à l'information du CCLAT. Ils sont 
selon toute vraisemblance fort nombreux.<P>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Consultation et conseils d'orientation</FONT></H3>
Les décideurs ont constitué un auditoire peu nombreux mais néanmoins influent, lors des présentations du 
CCLAT au gouvernement de l'Ontario, à des réunions internationales sur la réduction des méfaits, et à 
une réunion de la Commission des stupéfiants des Nations Unies à Vienne.<P>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Enseignement</FONT></H3>
Les membres du Service des politiques et de la recherche du CCLAT ont donné des cours sur la 
toxicomanie à l'université de Toronto, soit à 465 étudiants des premier, deuxième et troisième cycles en 
médecine et en santé communautaire.<P>

<H2>It's Time to Know:  Ten Marijuana Users Share Their Personal Stories</H2>
In this book, author/therapist Joanne Baum reveals the damage marijuana can do to people's lives. One person after another recounts how marijuana grew into an overpowering and negative force in their lives. "It is certainly clear from these people's stories that pot is not a harmless drug to be used with no consequences," says Baum in the final chapter. "Marijuana users can lose years from their lives and experience long-lasting mental and emotional pain." <P>

Partial author's abstract: The trials support the use of brief interventions by physicians for patients with 
drinking problems. Although further studies are needed to determine their effect on morbidity and 
mortality, the public health impact of such interventions is potentially enormous. Further research in 
needed to determine which patients are best suited for brief interventions, the optimal intensity of 
treatment and which components of brief interventions are most effective. Research is also needed to 
establish which strategies are effective in inducing physicians to use brief interventions.<P>

Partial author's abstract: A two-year prevention program was administered to 121 boys and girls 11 
through 12 years of age. Problem and no-problem children were randomly assigned to a prevention 
program or to a no-treatment group.  Treatment consisted of a modified version of the Life Skills Training 
Program.  Children who were in the prevention program developed more negative attitudes towards 
cigarettes and marijuana from pre-test to post-test as compared to control subjects. However, no 
significant differences between prevention and control children were obtained for use of cigarettes, alcohol 
and marijuana. Some links between proximal and sital variables were significant, albeit weak. Discussion 
addressed the limits of a child-centred prevention program, especially with regard to at-risk children<P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
Le syndrome d'alcoolisme ftal est reconnu comme étant l'une des principales causes évitables de 
malformations congénitales et de retard de développement infantile au Canada.<P>
Pour faire face à cet important problème de santé publique, les associations nationales qui 
représentent les milieux de la médecine, des sciences infirmières et des sages-femmes, les groupes 
autochtones et multiculturels et d'autres organismes réputés pour leurs travaux sur le SAF et les 
EAF ont mis au point et appuient cette <I>Déclaration conjointe sur la prévention du syndrome 
d'alcoolisme ftal et des effets de l'alcool sur le ftus au Canada</I> (voir la liste des co-
signataires ci-jointe).<P>
Cette déclaration vise à offrir des données factuelles pertinentes qui orienteront les professionnels 
de la santé appelés à traiter ou à conseiller les femmes, leur partenaire et leur famille concernant la 
consommation d'alcool pendant la grossesse.<P>
Aucun groupe, organisme, ministère ou niveau de gouvernement ni aucune collectivité ne peuvent 
s'attaquer efficacement à ce problème. Des efforts concertés sont nécessaires puisque chacun a 
intérêt à trouver des solutions à ce problème complexe.<P>
<H2>Définitions</H2>
Le syndrome d'alcoolisme ftal, ou SAF, est une entité clinique qui englobe une série 
d'anomalies associées à la  consommation d'alcool pendant la grossesse. Le diagnostic du SAF 
chez un enfant doit reposer au moins sur les critères suivants :<P>
<UL TYPE=square>
<LI>retard de croissance prénatal et/ou postnatal;
<LI>atteinte du système nerveux central, par exemple, anomalies neurologiques, retards de 
développement, troubles du comportement, troubles d'apprentissage ou autres déficits 
intellectuels et malformations cérébrales;
<LI>traits faciaux caractéristiques : raccourcissement des fentes palpébrales, minceur de la lèvre 
supérieure, aplatissement de la région maxillaire et sillon mal dessiné entre la lèvre supérieure et le 
nez (il faut se garder de confondre ces traits avec ceux que l'on retrouve normalement chez divers 
groupes raciaux).
</UL>
La désignation «effets possibles de l'alcool sur le ftus» (EAF) indique que l'alcool est considéré 
comme l'une des causes possibles de malformations congénitales chez un enfant.1 Cette 
expression sert à décrire les enfants ayant été exposés à l'alcool avant la naissance, mais qui ne 
présentent que quelques caractéristiques du SAF, entre autres, un retard ou un ralentissement de 
la croissance, des malformations congénitales simples ou des troubles d'apprentissage et de 
comportement qui, dans certains cas, ne deviennent apparents que dans les mois ou les années 
suivant la naissance.<P>
L'exposition à l'alcool avant la naissance peut entraîner des troubles de développement 
chroniques sous forme de SAF ou d'EAF possibles. S'il n'existe pas de statistiques concernant 
l'ampleur du phénomène du SAF et des EAF au Canada, on estime que dans les pays 
industrialisés, un à trois enfants sur 1 000 seront atteints du SAF à la naissance (Coles, 1993; 
Quinby et Graham, 1993). Le taux d'enfants touchés par des EAF à la naissance pourrait être 
beaucoup plus élevé. Il s'agit sans doute là de chiffres prudents, vu qu'il est difficile de calculer la 
fréquence d'une malformation congénitale qui (1) ne se détecte pas facilement à la naissance; (2) 
peut être confondue avec d'autres problèmes de santé et (3) doit être diagnostiquée au moyen 
d'un examen physique et à la lumière des antécédents médicaux du sujet, et non pas par un test de 
laboratoire.<P>
L'alcool est un agent tératogène connu qui, par son action sur la croissance et la formation 
normale de l'organisme et du cerveau du ftus, peut provoquer des malformations congénitales 
(Olson, 1992). Il peut avoir des effets dommageables sur le ftus à n'importe quel stade de la 
grossesse, et non pas seulement au cours du premier trimestre. L'alcool absorbé par la femme 
enceinte traverse rapidement la barrière placentaire, de sorte qu'on retrouve dans le sang du ftus 
une concentration d'alcool équivalente à celle observée chez la mère. Le cerveau et le système  
nerveux central de l'enfant à naître sont particulièrement sensibles à l'exposition prénatale à 
l'alcool.<P>
Les risques de SAF sont plus élevés en cas de consommation continue ou importante d'alcool 
pendant la grossesse (Streissguth, 1989; Olsen, 1992).2 Le phénomène a également été associé à 
des cas de consommation intermittente ou à des épisodes d'intoxication. D'autres études 
(Streissguth, 1990; Day, 1994; Jacobson, 1994) ont montré que les enfants nés de mères ayant 
consommé un verre ou deux par jour ou, à l'occasion, cinq verres ou plus à la fois, présentent des 
risques accrus de troubles d'apprentissage et d'autres troubles cognitifs et comportementaux.3<P>
Malgré tout, il n'existe aucune information définitive que l'on puisse communiquer aux femmes 
concernant la quantité d'alcool qui peut être consommée sans risque au cours de la grossesse. Par 
conséquent, <B><I>par mesure de prudence, les femmes qui sont enceintes ou qui pourraient 
le devenir devraient choisir de s'abstenir de boire.</B></I><P>
<H2>Efforts de prévention</H2>
De toute évidence, la prévention est la première mesure de défense contre les effets de l'alcool au 
cours de la grossesse. Elle devrait comprendre les éléments suivants :<P>
<UL TYPE=square>
<I><B><LI>Prévention primaire</B></I> - mesures qui empêchent l'apparition d'un éventuel 
problème de santé. Dans le cas du SAF et des EAF, il s'agit d'informer la population, surtout les 
jeunes, des dangers de la consommation d'alcool pendant la grossesse et, de manière plus 
générale, de tenir compte des déterminants de la santé.
<I><B><LI>Prévention secondaire</B></I> - mesures visant à reconnaître les sujets à risque. 
Les stratégies de prévention secondaire devraient comprendre les programmes de dépistage et 
d'intervention précoce et la prestation de services aux femmes enceintes et à celles qui sont en âge 
de procréer et qui sont susceptibles de mettre au monde un enfant atteint du SAF ou d'EAF.
<I><B><LI>Prévention tertiaire</B></I> - mesures destinées à prévenir la récurrence du 
phénomène par le biais du traitement et par des efforts visant à atténuer les effets cognitifs, 
comportementaux et sociaux du SAF et des EAF. Les stratégies de prévention tertiaire devraient 
comprendre le diagnostic et les programmes spécialement conçus pour les enfants atteints de SAF 
ou des EAF et pour ceux et celles qui en prennent soin, ainsi que les interventions auprès des 
femmes et de leur partenaire qui ont déjà un enfant atteint du SAF ou des EAF et qui prévoient 
avoir d'autres enfants.
</UL>
Comme les femmes enceintes sont généralement réceptives à l'idée de surveiller leur 
consommation d'alcool pendant leur grossesse, le professionnel de la santé se voit offrir  une 
excellente occasion de promouvoir des changements de comportement. La détection précoce de la 
consommation d'alcool chez les femmes enceintes et les conseils judicieux dispensés à ces 
dernières sont les pierres angulaires du traitement. Les professionnels de la santé peuvent jouer un 
rôle clé dans la réduction des risques associés à la consommation d'alcool au cours de la 
grossesse.<P>
<H2>Recommandations</H2>
Le SAF et les EAF peuvent être prévenus. C'est dans cette optique qu'ont été élaborées les 
recommandations suivantes :<P>
<OL>
<LI>Les efforts de prévention devraient être dirigés vers les femmes avant et pendant la période 
de la procréation, de même que vers les personnes qui ont de l'influence sur elles, entre autres, 
leur partenaire, leur famille et les membres de la collectivité. Tous les efforts doivent <B><I>tenir 
compte de la famille et du milieu culturel</B></I>, autrement dit, cibler aussi bien la femme 
enceinte que son partenaire et son milieu familial dans le contexte de la collectivité à laquelle ils 
appartiennent. De plus, ils doivent <B><I>reposer sur une démarche intégrée</B></I>, en 
d'autres termes, mobiliser tous les services que suppose la prise en compte des besoins souvent 
complexes de ces femmes sur les plans social, économique et affectif.<BR>

<LI>Il y a lieu de diffuser auprès de tous les professionnels de la santé de l'information 
concernant les risques liés à la consommation d'alcool pendant la grossesse afin de faciliter le 
dépistage précoce des comportements à risque et l'intervention précoce.<BR>

<LI>Il faudrait étendre et évaluer les programmes de formation continue destinés aux 
professionnels de la santé et conçus pour leur permettre d'améliorer leurs compétences en 
counselling, de façon à ce qu'ils puissent inciter et aider les buveurs et buveuses à risque à 
modifier leur comportement. Par ailleurs, les professionnels de la santé devraient se familiariser 
avec les ressources qui existent dans leur collectivité pour inciter et aider les buveurs et buveuses 
à risque à modifier leur comportement.<BR>

<LI>Les professionnels de la santé qui travaillent auprès des membres et des responsables des 
collectivités doivent transmettre aux femmes et à leur partenaire un message uniforme, à savoir 
qu'il est plus prudent de s'abstenir de boire pendant la grossesse.<BR>

<LI>Les professionnels de la santé ont un rôle essentiel à jouer en repérant les femmes dont la  
consommation d'alcool présente un risque pour le ftus et pour elles-mêmes. Il faudrait appliquer 
des méthodes de dépistage4 pour déterminer quelles sont les femmes qui risquent de consommer 
de grandes quantités d'alcool avant et durant la grossesse. De même, les professionnels de la santé 
se doivent d'informer les femmes à risque, d'intervenir de façon positive et d'orienter l'intéressée 
vers les services appropriés.<BR>

<LI>Il faudrait que les services de traitement de l'alcoolisme et des toxicomanies tiennent compte 
des besoins des femmes dans la planification de leurs programmes, notamment en ce qui concerne 
les services de transport et de garderie. Les centres de traitement de l'alcoolisme et des 
toxicomanies devraient accorder la priorité aux femmes enceintes qui s'adressent à eux.<BR>

<LI>Les professionnels de la santé devraient informer les femmes ayant consommé à l'occasion 
de faibles quantités d'alcool dans leur grossesse que le risque pour le ftus, pendant la plupart des 
cas, est sans doute très faible. Ils devraient informer les femmes que le risque dépend de la 
quantité d'alcool consommée, de la morphologie, de la santé nutritionnelle et d'autres facteurs liés 
au mode de vie de la future mère. Ils devraient informer les femmes déjà exposées au risque que le 
fait de cesser de boire à n'importe quel stade de la grossesse sera bénéfique pour le ftus comme 
pour elles-mêmes.<BR>

<LI>Les professionnels de la santé, incluant les omnipraticiens, les pédiatres et les autres 
professionnels à qui sont adressés les enfants devraient chercher à être mieux sensibilisés à la 
question de la consommation d'alcool pendant la grossesse de façon à pouvoir aider à déterminer 
les causes possibles de malformations congénitales et d'autres troubles du développement ainsi 
qu'à reconnaître et à prévenir les risques possibles lors des grossesses à venir.<BR>

<LI>Les chercheurs et les intervenants en santé doivent être en communication constante pour 
trouver et évaluer les moyens de prévention primaire, secondaire et tertiaire les plus efficaces dans 
la lutte contre le SAF et les EAF.
</OL>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
La consommation d'alcool pendant la grossesse est un problème de santé d'intérêt national. Les 
professionnels de la santé des quatre coins du Canada ont la responsabilité de trouver et de mettre 
en oeuvre des stratégies de prévention qui auront pour effet de réduire l'incidence du SAF et des 
EAF.<P>

children will be discussed, as well tools to help children build missing skills.<P>
2d COMMUNITY ISSUES STREAM: <B>FAS/NAS Teaching/Learning Challenges 
in Indigenous Contexts</B><P>
<I>William J. Mussell</I><P>
Awareness of FAS/FAS in most indigenous contexts is an early stage. Learning about 
FAS/NAS usually stimulates strong feelings, deep reflections and wonderment about 
effects of alcohol in affected individuals' own lives. Grieving of personal losses is strongly 
indicated. Matters of intervention pose unique challenges. Reasons for these circumstances 
and ways and means to work effectively in indigenous contexts as an agent of change will 
be explored.<P>

3b PARENT'S ISSUES STREAM:<B> Healing the Pain Within - First Nations 
FAS/FAE Parenting Skills Group</B><P>
<I>Carol Hoof</I><P>
This workshop recognizes that many First Nations families living off-reserve want to 
retain their health and cultural identify. Experiences with alcohol abuse, residential 
schools, foster homes, and prison settings have robbed families of the opportunity to live a 
good life. The workshop is focused on education and support for parents and caregivers of 
children suspected of or diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effects. 
The Medicine Wheel Teachings has been a compelling symbol and teacher for many 
Original people. The Wheel will be used to help participants explore aspects of healthy 
family lifestyles. Strategies for overcoming past wounds will be explored. Making peace 
with the past through ritual and ceremony can help people get to the present. Participants 
will have the opportunity to explore personal components of their own parenting styles of 
First Nations children affected by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects.<P>
3c YOUTH ISSUES STREAM: <B>Getting In Step with Youth: A Substance Abuse 
Primary Prevention Workshop</B><P>
<I>Diane Champion-Smith</I><P>
One of the keys for successful substance abuse prevention in the general population is to 
meaningfully involve young people in the planning, organizing and implementing of 
programs and activities. This session explores how the Kaiser Youth Foundation actively 
involved young people in the development of the resource 'Step by Step', and what alcohol 
and other drug prevention knowledge, information and skills young people need at 
different ages. The workshop will provide opportunities to exchange ideas with other 
participants about strategies and resources in the general population.<P>
3d COMMUNITY ISSUES STREAM: <B>Pregnancy, Substance Misuse, and 
Parenting: Community Integrated Approaches to Prevention, Education and 
Support to High Risk Families</B><P>
<I>Marlene Thio-Watts and Lisa Samms-Maxwell</I><P>

education strategies for the prevention of Fetal Alcohol and Drug Effects.<P>
3e EDUCATIONAL/VOCATIONAL ISSUES STREAM:<B> When Good Techniques 
Don't Work: Trying Differently Rather than Harder</B><P>
<I>Diane Malbin</I><P>
Good parents, teachers and clinicians, using good techniques, are often mystified when 
their strategies seem ineffective in supporting those with FAS/ARND. This session 
explores how otherwise good techniques may be incompatible with the needs of those 
with organic brain differences, and introduces concrete examples and guidelines for 
developing more effective and appropriate interventions.<P>
3f COMMUNITY ISSUES STREAM: <B>Advocacy in Action</B><P>
<I>Jane Holland</I><P>

and loss of optimism with a focus on minimizing damage and maximizing resolution for 
the family and child while exploring alternate approaches to caregiving.<P>

and Intervention Program (CHIP)</B><P>
<I>Jason Louie</I><P>

<TITLE>La Grossesse et l'alcool en questions; Éduc alcool</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>La grossesse et l'alcool en 
questions</H1>
<I><H3>Éduc'alcool</I> et <I>Collège des médecins du 
Québec</H3></I>
<HR>
Éduc'alcool est un organisme indépendant à but non lucratif qui regroupe les associations des distillateurs, 
des négociants en vins, des viniculteurs, des fabricants de cidre, des agences de vins et spiritueux, la Régie 
des alcools, des courses et des jeux et la Société des alcools du Québec ainsi que des membres à titre 
individuel.<P>
Conscients de leur mission sociale, les partenaires de l'industrie des boissons alcooliques mettent sur pied, 
par l'entremise d'Éduc'alcool, une série de programmes d'information, de prévention et d'éducation pour 
aider jeunes et adultes à prendre des décisions responsables et éclairées face à la consommation 
d'alcool.<P>
C'est ainsi qu'Éduc'alcool se joint au Collège des médecins du Québec pour présenter "La grossesse et 
l'alcool en questions" qui répond dans un langage simple et accessible aux interrogations que se posent les 
femmes enceintes ou celles qui ont l'intention d'avoir un enfant.<P>
Il s'agit là d'une version revue et corrigée après quatre rééditions d'une première version.  Elle est la 
synthèse de renseignements recueillis auprès des docteurs Harry Bard, chef du service de néonatologie de 
l'hôpital Sainte-Justine, Marie-Chantale Le Monnier du département d'obstétrique de l'hôpital 
Maisonneuve-Rosemont et Jean-Pierre Chiasson, directeur médical, Clinique du Nouveau départ.  Qu'ils 
soient ici remerciés de leur contribution.<P>
<HR>
<IMG SRC="/educ1.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-1-" HSPACE=3><B>Mon conjoint et moi avons décidé d'avoir un enfant.  Puis-je continuer à boire jusqu'à ce que je 
sois enceinte?</B><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
La femme qui réduit sa consommation d'alcool à partir du moment où elle désire concevoir offre à son 
enfant un environnement sain et propice à son développement.  Celle qui évite de consommer fait un 
choix encore plus sûr.  Parce qu'il est souvent difficile d'identifier le moment exact où se produit la 
fécondation et que l'embryon est particulièrement vulnérable pendant le premier trimestre.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ2.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-2-" HSPACE=3><B>Je viens d'apprendre que je suis enceinte de six semaines.  J'ai bu quelques verres dernièrement.  Dois-je 
m'inquiéter pour mon bébé?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Nullement.  Il n'est jamais trop tard pour assurer un développement optimal au foetus en diminuant votre 
consommation d'alcool ou en évitant de consommer, si vous désirez faire un choix encore plus sûr.  Les 
problèmes de développement de l'enfant sont habituellement liés à une consommation d'alcool excessive et 
chronique.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ3.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-3-" HSPACE=3><B>J'aime boire du vin en mangeant un bon repas. Dois-je changer mes habitudes durant ma grossesse?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
À ce jour, rien ne permet de déterminer un seuil minimal de consommation entièrement sécuritaire pour 
le développement du futur bébé.  Par contre, les risques d'avortements spontanés, de malformations, de 
retard de croissance et de déficience mentale augmentent avec la quantité d'alcool ingérée par la mère et 
avec la fréquence de sa consommation.<P>
Consommer avec modération et occasionnellement, voilà donc la ligne de conduite responsable qui 
s'impose lors d'une grossesse.  Éviter de consommer de l'alcool demeure le choix le plus sûr.<P>
Toutefois, une femme enceinte qui désire consommer, même modérément, devrait toujours en parler avec 
son médecin afin qu'il puisse l'aider à évaluer sa situation.  Elle sera alors à même de prendre une décision 
plus éclairée.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ4.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-4-" HSPACE=3><B>La consommation excessive d'alcool a-t-elle une incidence sur le foetus?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Oui. En consommant une quantité d'alcool relativement importante et de manière fréquente, les femmes 
enceintes s'exposent à donner naissance à des enfants présentant certains problèmes spécifiques.  On dit 
de ces enfants qu'ils sont atteints du syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal (SAF), c'est-à-dire un ensemble de 
problèmes pouvant se présenter sous forme d'un retard de croissance, d'un déficit intellectuel, de 
malformations cardiaques, d'une tête anormalement petite et d'autres anomalies faciales et du squelette.  
Une consommation excessive occasionnelle comporte aussi certains dangers similaires.<P>
Une femme qui éprouve de la difficulté à contrôler sa consommation d'alcool devrait en discuter avec son 
médecin ou tout autre intervenant avant même d'envisager une grossesse et tout au long de celle-ci.  Elle 
trouvera ainsi le support adéquat.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ5.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-5-" HSPACE=3><B>Est-ce qu'une consommation raisonnable d'alcool fait courir le même risque à l'enfant?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Non.  Une femme qui boit avec modération (un verre de vin ou deux) diminue de beaucoup les risques 
d'atteintes au foetus.  L'effet toxique de l'alcool est proportionnel à la quantité ingérée et à la fréquence.  
Par ailleurs, l'alcool n'est jamais le seul facteur intervenant dans le développement du bébé.  La santé des 
parents, leurs antécédents, leur style de vie, l'alimentation de la mère, les polluants extérieurs, l'usage du 
tabac et de drogues durant la grossesse ainsi que les conditions socio-économiques influencent le cours des 
choses. Même dans des conditions idéales, une femme ne peut jamais contrôler complètement sa 
grossesse.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ6.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-6-" HSPACE=3><B>Pourquoi l'alcool peut-il nuire au développement du bébé?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
L'alcool est une substance toxique qui passe rapidement du sang de la mère à celui du bébé.  Les organes 
du foetus étant en plein développement, ils sont particulièrement vulnérables à tout produit toxique, 
surtout pendant les trois premiers mois de grossesse.  La femme enceinte a tout intérêt à modifier ses 
habitudes de vie dès le début de sa grossesse (réduire sa consommation d'alcool, éviter toute autre 
substance toxique, surveiller son alimentation, etc.).<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ7.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-7-" HSPACE=3><B>Est-il vrai que le vin et la bière sont moins dommageables pour le foetus que des boissons fortes en 
alcool?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Non. Une ration habituelle des trois produits contient exactement la même quantité d'alcool.  Gardez en 
tête qu'une ration correspond soit à une bouteille de bière (355 ml) ou à une once et demie de spiritueux 
(44 ml de whiskey, gin ou autre) ou encore à 5 onces de vin (148 ml).  Le passage de l'alcool du sang de la 
mère à celui du bébé peut être ralenti si elle mange avant de consommer.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ8.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-8-" HSPACE=3><B>Nous célébrerons notre dixième anniversaire de mariage.  Puis-je boire à cette occasion?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Si c'est important pour vous, vous pouvez le faire sans crainte lors d'une occasion spéciale en consommant 
un verre ou deux en mangeant, particulièrement à la fin de la grossesse.<P>
Personne, en aucune circonstance, n'est en droit d'inciter qui que ce soit à consommer des boissons 
alcoolisées.  Personnes non plus ne devrait culpabiliser une femme enceinte qui décide de boire 
modérément.  Rien ne sert d'être alarmiste.<P>
<IMG SRC="/educ9.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=45 HEIGHT=45 ALT="-9-" HSPACE=3><B>J'ai choisi d'allaiter mon bébé.  Puis-je prendre un verre à l'occasion?</B> <BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Toute femme qui choisit l'allaitement doit penser à son bien-être et à celui de son nourrisson.  Une 
alimentation équilibrée, du repos et une consommation modérée d'alcool s'imposent.  De plus, elle doit 
éviter de consommer lors de l'allaitement car l'enfant absorbera la même quantité d'alcool que sa mère en 
prenant son repas.  Les femmes qui optent pour l'allaitement mixte peuvent se permettre de boire 
modérément à l'occasion (pas plus de deux consommations) et remplacer la tétée par un biberon.  Il faut 
compter au moins deux heures pour éliminer l'alcool.<P>

The province of Saskatchewan has been a leader in research and program development in 
the area of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome since the mid-1970s. The first diagnosed case of Fetal 
Alcohol Syndrome in Canada was made in Saskatchewan at Royal University Hospital, 
Saskatoon, in 1975. In-depth research into the incidence and prevalence of FAS continues. 
The Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps has conducted education and 
health promotion activities since 1984. In March 1993 the Institute was instrumental in 
forming the Saskatchewan Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Coordinating Committee, a provincial 
interagency committee that coordinates the prevention efforts in the province. Support for 
the program is provided by Canada's Drug Strategy, Health Canada.<P>
<H3>Research and Therapy for FAS</H3>
The Alvin Buckwold Centre (now a program of the Kinsmen Children's Centre), located in 
Royal University Hospital, Saskatoon, has focused on treatment and research in FAS since 
1972. Dr.'s B.F. Habbick, R. Casey, W.A. Zaleski, and F. Murphy were the first Canadians 
to publish findings on liver dysmorphology in FAS patients in March 1979. In-depth 
research into the incidence and prevalence of FAS was being conducted in Saskatchewan 
as early as 1980. A study conducted at the Alvin Buckwold Centre, Saskatoon, from 1980 
to 1982 identified 73 cases of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and 139 cases of Alcohol Related 
Birth Defects. The study won the Sam Rovinovitch Research award from the Canadian 
Council for Exceptional Children. A similar study is in progress at the Kinsmen Children's 
Centre, Saskatoon (formerly Alvin Buckwold Centre).<P>
Intensive therapeutic services for children with FAS have been provided in Saskatchewan 
since the condition was first diagnosed in 1975. To date, services have been provided for 
over 500 Saskatchewan children. To enhance service delivery, a unique multidisciplinary 
program was developed at the Kinsmen Children's Centre in August 1991. The FAS 
Program Team consists of an occupational therapist, physician, physiotherapist, 
psychologist and speech and language pathologist. FAS Clinics are held twice a month, 
providing diagnosis, assessment, treatment and support for children and families effected 
by FAS. Additional support is provided by the Early Childhood Intervention Program and 
preschool programs at the Centre.<P>
<H3>Prevention Education Programs</H3>
The Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps has focused on FAS since the 
early 1980s. The Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps is a provincial non-
profit organization, founded in 1981. The Prevention Institute is funded by a group of 
Shareholders: Government of Saskatchewan, Kinsmen Foundation, Saskatchewan 
Association for Community Living, Saskatchewan Abilities Council, University of 
Saskatchewan, and the community at large. The mandate is to promote province-wide 
awareness of preventive measures to reduce the incidence of handicapping conditions in 
children.<P>
The Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps, in consultation with its Medical 
Advisory Committee, identified Fetal Alcohol Syndrome as a major program area in 1985. 
Since that time, it has developed and delivered prevention awareness information 
throughout the province, and, increasingly, throughout Canada and other countries. 
During the past nine years, the FAS Prevention Program has involved a provincial 
conference, workshops, talks, a research survey and the continuing distribution of videos 
and an FAS Information Kit. Programming has included the following activities:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Media</B>. Public Service Announcements (PSAs) have been developed and 
distributed to media outlets throughout the province. Television and radio spots have been 
developed and aired on Saskatchewan stations since the early 1980s. Other media 
activities have included newspaper and magazine articles and interviews on television and 
radio. The messages are aimed at the general public and provide educational information 
on the dangers of drinking alcohol during pregnancy.
<B><LI>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Effects Conference, </B>November, 1985. Co-
sponsored by the Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps and the 
Saskatchewan Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission. One hundred participants attended, 
including physicians, nurses, social workers, counselors, educators, students, and other 
interested members of the public. Proceedings are available from the Institute.
<B><LI>Community Education. </B>An ongoing program of the Saskatchewan 
Institute on Prevention of Handicaps: Staff make approximately 50 presentations a year on 
prevention topics, including raising awareness of FAS. Participants include health 
professionals, students of all levels from elementary through university, community 
groups, and occupational groups. Staff also attend workshops and conferences on FAS 
and present displays throughout the province.
<B><LI>Physicians' Survey. </B>In conjunction with the Kinsmen Children's Centre of 
Royal University Hospital, the Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps 
conducted a provincial survey of pediatricians and general/family practitioners. Results of 
the survey indicate a high level of awareness among physicians in Saskatchewan.
<B><LI>FAS Information Kits. </B>This resource was first developed in 1985, when 
FAS was identified as a major prevention challenge. The kit has since been updated and 
extended by the inclusion of resource material, including a Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Fact 
Sheet. In the past four years, the Prevention Institute has distributed over 2000 FAS Kits 
to community health offices, nurses, educators, physicians, special education teachers, 
other professionals, media, community members, parents, and foster parents throughout 
Saskatchewan.
<B><LI>A Pregnant Woman Never Drinks Alone</B>. This<I> </I>video 
presentation, aired on CKCK TV in Regina, was developed with cooperation of the 
Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention of Handicaps, and features programs addressing 
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome throughout the province. 
<B><LI>Kinsmen Children's Centre. </B>The Saskatchewan Institute on Prevention 
of Handicaps is part of a Centre which provides diagnosis, therapy, support, education and 
information to parents, caregivers, students, professionals and the public. The KCC 
addresses disabling conditions in children from all causes, including Fetal Alcohol 
Syndrome.
</UL>
<H3>Saskatchewan FAS Prevention Program</H3>
Assisted by funding from Canada's Drug Strategy, the Saskatchewan Institute on 
Prevention of Handicaps houses a provincial prevention program for FAS. Recent 
activities in this program have included: a provincial needs assessment; a provincial 
symposium in October 1993; community consultations; and the formation of a provincial 
coordinating committee in March 1993.<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Saskatchewan FAS Coordinating Committee. </B>The committee was 
formed in March 1993. Membership has expanded since its formation, and the committee 
currently includes the following agencies and organizations:
<UL>
<LI>Kinsmen Children's Centre
<LI>Alcohol and Drug Services, Saskatchewan Health (Saskatchewan Alcohol and Drug 
Abuse Commission)

</UL>
<B><LI>Provincial Needs Assessment. </B>Conducted during the summer of 1993, the 
needs assessment involved interviews with key individuals throughout Saskatchewan in 
the areas of health, social services, education, justice and with young women and parents 
of children with FAS. Interviews were conducted with 83 key informants from all parts of 
Saskatchewan. Off -site discussions occurred at six sites in the province.  
<B><LI>Saskatchewan FAS Symposium</B>. The symposium, held in October 1993, 
provided an opportunity for 300 participants to share perspectives and knowledge of FAS. 
Participants represented health, social services, education, justice, Aboriginal groups, 
community groups, and parents. Recommendations from the symposium have been taken 
to the provincial coordinating committee with the goal of developing an action plan to 
address FAS in Saskatchewan. 
<B><LI>Provincial FAS Consultation</B>. A consultation took place in May 1994 to 
address the recommendations from the symposium. Subcommittees in the areas of 
Education, Justice, Health, Parents/Community, and Social Services formed and chose 
priority recommendations from which to develop action plans. These subcommittees 
continue to meet and work independently under the leadership of the Saskatchewan FAS 
Coordinating Committee.
<B><LI>Current Initiatives. </B>Current initiatives of the subcommittees include the 
development of training materials for use by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; plans to 
form a provincial parent support group; preparation of a comprehensive teacher inservice 
package, and development of a comprehensive inventory of health resources and services 
in FAS.

<H2><A NAME = best></A>Best Start:  
Community Action for Healthy Babies</H2>
<H4>Abstract</H4>
Best Start is a population health program aimed at reducing the incidence of low birth 
weight.  Two demonstration sites, the District of Algoma and the City of Barrie, will 
receive funding from the Ministry of Health from 1992 to 1998.  The site coalitions are to 
support and mobilize their communities to promote the health of women and families 
before, during and after pregnancy.  The sites will use community wide health promotion 
approaches to address the range of risk factors associated with low birth weight.  The 
innovations from this program will be shared across Ontario.<P>
Since September 1993 the central administration and resource centre for consultation and 
training for Best Start has been located at the Ontario Prevention Clearinghouse.<P>
<H4>Health Issue</H4>
Low birth weight is an indicator of the health of mothers and babies and therefore the 
health of a community.  Low birth weight infants weigh less than 2500 grams (5.5 lbs).  
They may be premature, or they may be small for gestational age.  Low birth weight 
infants are at risk of dying or developing serious health problems which may last a lifetime.  
Best Start aims to reduce the incidence of low birth weight by effecting changes in risk 
conditions.  Risk factors include behavioural factors such as smoking, environmental ones 
such as workplace conditions, and the larger determinants of health such as poverty.<P>
<H4>Goal and Objectives</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The long term goal is to reduce the rate of low birth weight.
<LI>To promote the health of women and families before, during and after pregnancy.
<LI>To support and mobilize communities to promote the health of women and families.
</UL>
<H4>Approach</H4>
Best Start is a community-wide program the involves the collaboration of community 
agencies, groups, leasers and residents.  Program activities will focus on women, men, 
children, and families in the community and take place in multiple settings.<P>
A variety of health promotion strategies will be used.  Education to change behaviour 
within individuals in a community will be used along with policy and environmental 
support.  A range of risk factors related to low birth weight will be addressed.<P>
The two demonstration sites will test the effectiveness of their strategies.  The central 
evaluation of Best Start is being done by a consulting firm contracted by the Ministry of 
Health.  An evaluation steering committee with representatives from the demonstration 
sites and the central resource centre will coordinate central evaluation activities.  The 
ministry will share information and innovations from this project with communities across 
Ontario.<P>
<H4>Progress to Date</H4>
<H5>A. Demonstration Sites</H5>
The sites have completed the first developmental year and one year of implementation.  
They are now implementing their 994-1995 action plans for intervention.<P>
Algoma Best Start is made up of five coalitions including North Algoma, Sault Ste. Marie, 
the North Shore, the North Shore Tribal Council and Elliot Lake.  Community 
development workers in each of these areas work with a coalition of residents to 
implement program activities.  The central message of Algoma Best Start is "Every Baby 
Deserves a Best Start".  This message is carried out in initiatives that are planned to have a 
positive impact on community attitudes and behaviours.  Interventions are planned to help 
people make healthy choices about food, tobacco, alcohol and drugs.  Adolescents will be 
supported to make healthy lifestyle choices related to pregnancy and parenting.  Each 
initiative will be operated as a pilot in one of the areas, and evaluated before it is carried 
out across the District of Algoma.<P>
Best Start Barrie is organized by eight risk factor categories to direct the focus for change 
towards healthier community models and lifestyles.  The eight initiatives are directed 
towards low birth weight awareness, reproductive health, food for health, tobacco use, 
substance abuse, violence, workplace health and poverty.  In addition to an overall 
population-based strategy the plan emphasizes populations of interest - youth, low 
income, isolated mothers and non-profit tenants associations.  Task forces of community 
volunteers with representation from the steering committee and staff will initiate activities 
across the city of Barrie.<P>

<HR>
Le Service d'information sur le SAF et les EAF, commandité par le CCLAT, Santé Canada, l'Association 
des Brasseurs du Canada et l'Association des distillateurs canadien, a été créé suite à une 
recommendation, en 1992, d'un comité parlementaire sur le syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal et les effets de 
l'alcoolisme foetal.  Le service offre notamment un comptoir de consultation bilingue spécialisé, qu'on 
peut rejoindre au 1-800-559-4514 (sans frais au Canada seulment), au (613) 235-4048, par télécopieur au 
(613) 235-8101 ou par la poste<P>

<TITLE>Service d'information sur le SAF et les EAF, Évaluation de la première 
année</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Service d'information sur le SAF et les 
EAF</H1>
<H2>Évaluation de la première année</H2>
Le Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies a lancé le Service d'information sur le SAF 
et les EAF en mai 1994.  L'objet du service, qui est financé par Santé Canada, l'Association des distillateurs 
canadiens, l'Association des brasseurs du Canada et le CCLAT, est de rassembler et de diffuser de 
l'information exacte, opportune et détaillée sur le SAF et les EAF dans une variété de présentations.  Les 
utilisateurs attendus du service sont les parents et les soignants des enfants touchés par le SAF et les EAF, 
les médecins, les infirmiers et d'autres professionnels de la santé, les enseignants, les professionnels des 
toxicomanies, les avocats, la police et les législateurs.  L'information est fournie dans les deux langues 
officielles grâce à une ligne sans frais (1 800 559-4514) qui vous met en communication avec un spécialiste 
en information.  On peut également y avoir accès sur le World Wide Web d'Internet.<P>
En mars 1995, le personnel du service a entrepris une évaluation de la première année de fonctionnement afin 
d'évaluer la réponse au service et d'identifier toute lacune dans les services et les activités.  L'évaluation 
était fondée sur les statistiques d'utilisation et sur une enquête aléatoire menée auprès de 100 clients du 
service (64 réponses).<P>
<H3>Statistiques sur l'utilisation</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Entre mai 1994 et février 1995, 631 demandes au total ont été reçues.  Le nombre de demandes s'est 
accru constamment chaque mois, passant de 17 en mai à 108 en février.
<LI>Tous les groupes d'utilisateurs étaient représentés.  Les professionnels du traitement et des soins de 
santé étaient responsables du plus grand nombre de demandes, suivi des parents et des soignants, des 
organismes non gouvernementaux, des étudiants et des éducateurs.
<LI>Les demandes sont venues de toutes les provinces et des territoires.  Le plus grand nombre de 
demandes provenait de l'Ontario, suivie de la Colombie-Britannique, du Manitoba et de l'Alberta.  On a 
également reçu un certain nombre de demandes internationales.  La majorité des demandes ont été faites par 
l'entremise de la ligne sans frais.
<LI>Les clients demandaient le plus souvent de l'information générale sur le SAF et les EAF, puis de 
l'information sur l'adaptation, sur la prévention et sur l'éducation.
</UL>
<H3>Sondage auprès des clients</H3>
<UL>
<LI>67 % ont classé l'information reçue comme étant excellente, et 33% l'ont classée comme très bien;  73 % étaient d'avis que 
la rapidité avec laquelle l'information était fournie était excellente, et 27 %, qu'elle était très bien.
<LI>100 % des répondants ont déclaré qu'ils utiliseraient encore le service.
<LI>100 % des répondants ont déclaré qu'ils aiguilleraient d'autres personnes vers le service.
</UL>
<H3>Résumé</H3>
Les résultats de l'évaluation étaient très favorables.  Dans l'ensemble, les clients du service provenaient de 
tous les groupes d'intervenants prévus.  Cependant, le service semble avoir été sous-utilisé par deux 
groupes : les collectivités autochtones et les chercheurs.  Un envoi postal spécial à l'intention des 
collectivités autochtones est prévu pour la deuxième année du service.  On prévoit que la diffusion de 
l'information grâce à Internet stimulera l'utilisation du service par le milieu des chercheurs.  Les clients 
étaient très satisfaits de la qualité et de la rapidité de la prestation des services.  Un certain nombre de 
recommandations sont ressorties de l'évaluation, notamment le besoin de plus de publicité sur les services 
et celui d'une liste nationale de conférenciers et d'un service d'aiguillage pour le traitement, la prévention et 
l'éducation.<P>

<TITLE>Lettre d'Action Nouvelles</TITLE>
<FONT COLOR="0000FF"><H2>Important avis aux lecteurs <I>Action Nouvelles</I></H2> </FONT>
Cher collègue,<P>
Au cours des années 80, les problèmes de santé et socio-économiques associés aux drogues causaient une telle inquiétude que les gouvernements américain et canadien ont alors jugé essentiel de créer certains programmes, notamment le US War on Drugs et la Stratégie canadienne antidrogue (SCA). L'intérêt porté à ces questions cruciales s'est depuis estompé, de même que l'apport financier gouvernemental à la prévention et au traitement des toxicomanies. Cette situation est déplorable, d'autant plus que l'on constate actuellement une résurgence de l'usage et de l'abus des drogueshéroïne comprisechez les jeunes en Amérique du Nord.<P>
Le Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies, financé à l'origine au rythme de deux 
millions de dollars par année, dans le cadre de la SCA, ne reçoit plus que 40 % de cette allocation. Or, 
la SCA cessera d'exister cette année, et aucun autre fonds n'a encore été prévu pour le Centre après le 31 mars 1997. Plus tôt dans l'année, on l'avait déjà sévèrement privé de la moitié de la subvention de base allouée l'année précédente. L'an dernier, le Centre a néanmoins pu aller chercher 38 % de son budget dans la vente de ses produits et services et poursuit ses efforts en vue de l'autonomie financière, mais sans l'aide financière essentielle aux activités dont les coûts ne sont pas entièrement récupérablesdont l'exploitation du Centre national de documentation sur l'alcoolisme et les toxicomaniesson avenir est sérieusement menacé.<P>
Cette crise de financement a profondément modifié le CCLAT, qui a dû réduire son organisation et abandonner certaines fonctions non spécifiquement exigées par la loi. C'est ainsi que s'en va <I>Action Nouvelles</I>, dont l'absence, à en juger d'après la réponse des lecteurs au fil des années, créera sûrement un grand vide. Le bulletin permettait de maintenir le partage de l'information après la désintégration de plusieurs organismes provinciaux indépendants de toxicomanie.<P>
A titre d'abonné, vous êtes sûrement concerné par la disparition d'<I>Action Nouvelles</I>, aussi verrez-vous, à l'endos de la présente, comment nous entendons honorer notre engagement à votre égard. Dans une optique plus large, vous conviendrez sans doute avec nous que le problème de financement à la source de cette disparition trahit bien le manque de disposition des divers gouvernements à s'attaquer sérieusement à l'immense dossier de la toxicomanie. Si l'absence de leadership dans ce domaine vous gêne, dites-le nouset faisons-le savoir aux politiciens. Il faut réagir sans tarder, avant que ne disparaisse à son tour la Stratégie canadienne antidrogue, et rappeler à nos dirigeants qu'une action catégorique est non seulement possible, mais essentielle. Dans un an, il sera trop tard.<P>
Veuillez agréer, cher collègue, l'expression de nos bons sentiments.<P>

Le centre virtuel de documentation sur l'alcool, le tabac et les autres drogues résulte d'un effort de collaboration d'un certain nombre d'organisations qui ont un intérêt à diffuser de l'information de qualité concernant la nature, l'étendue et les conséquences reliées à l'utilisation de l'alcool, du tabac et des autres drogues. Sont  inclus le traitement, la recherche, le contrôle et le développement de politiques. Le centre virtuel de documentation vise une représentation mondiale et une information crédible, équilibrée et de qualité sur les sujets reliés à l'usage et à l'abus de l'alcool, du tabac et des autres drogues.<P>
Il s'agit d'un projet pilote d'une durée de six mois. Nous apprécions <A HREF="/atod/frform.htm">tout commentaire</A> qui nous aidera à améliorer le contenu et à évaluer ce nouveau service.<P>

Le centre virtuel de documentation sur l'alcool, le tabac et les autres drogues est créé et  maintenu par nombre d'organisations travaillant en partenariat.  Les partenaires de ce centre virtuel de documentation doivent rencontrer les critères décrits ci-après.  Ces critères ont été établis afin de s'assurer qu'une information de qualité supérieure soit disponible sur le réseau Internet.<P>
<H3>Critères d'inclusion</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Doit être une organisation ou une association et non simplement un individu.
<LI>Doit avoir une présence sur le réseau Internet (pas seulement une adresse électronique) et ne pas simplement faire la promotion d'un produit ou d'un service.
<LI>Doit offrir une information unique provenant de l'organisation, en lien avec l'alcool, le tabac et les autres drogues. Cette information sera la contribution de l'organisation/association à la banque de données des textes entiers.
<LI>Doit être impliquée dans le domaine des politiques, de la recherche ou de la programmation et avoir une bibliothèque ou une ressource fournissant un support à l'information pour les spécialistes de la prévention et de l'intervention et pour le public en général. <I>(Ce critère fait actuellement l'objet d'une discussion).</I>
<LI>Ne doit pas être uniquement voué à la défense ou à la promotion d'une position, d'un point de vue ou d'une question spécifique, mais fournir de l'information générale et crédible (sujet à révision interne et externe et à ce titre, clairement indiqué)

Pour les organisations qui ne se qualifient pas ou qui n'ont pas d'intérêt pour le partenariat:
<UL>
<LI>Un ensemble de liens seront maintenus sur Internet avec d'autres ressources reliées au domaine de l'alcool, du tabac et des autres drogues.
<LI>Pour les autres organisations qui désirent fournir de l'information à cette banque, elles pourront le faire par le moyen d'arrangements avec les partenaires de l'organisation.
</UL></UL>
<H3>Processus</H3>
Les organisations désirant devenir partenaires du centre virtuel de documentation seront évaluées à  partir des critères établis.  Éventuellement, les organisations partenaires pourraient travailler avec un groupe aviseur, formé de professionnels dans le domaine, pour rendre les décisions relatives à l'admission des groupes membres. Il est important que le groupe soit représentatif sur le plan international et couvre les différents secteurs du domaine. La demande d'adhésion à titre de partenaire pourrait être soumise par voie électronique aux membres du comité aviseur et de planification.<P>
Les organisations qui souhaitent devenir partenaires du centre virtuel de documentation doivent soumettre l'information au comité par ce <A HREF="/atod/frapplic.htm">formulaire de demande d'adhésion.</A>
