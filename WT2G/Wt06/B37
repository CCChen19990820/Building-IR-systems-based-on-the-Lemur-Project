<TITLE>Estimating the Costs of Substance Abuse: Introduction</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>1. Estimating the Costs of Substance 
Abuse: Introduction</H2>
There is a strong interest in many countries regarding the development of scientifically valid, 
credible estimates of the economic costs of drugs and alcohol. The costs of alcohol and drugs is an 
issue of key interest to stakeholders, policy makers and the media. Knowledge of the costs of 
resources associated with alcohol and drug abuse informs decisions related to funding and to 
interventions which are designed to reduce abuse. Relatively few countries have attempted to 
estimate the costs of substance abuse. Such estimates are fraught with methodological difficulties 
resulting in widely varying estimates.<P>
In May 1994 an international symposium was held in Banff, Canada, to discuss the issues involved 
in estimating the social and economic costs of substance abuse, and to seek a consensus on the 
most appropriate model. The purpose of the meeting was to explore the feasibility of establishing 
an internationally acceptable common methodology for estimating the costs of alcohol and other 
drugs. <P>
The symposium in Banff brought together persons with experience and expertise in dealing with 
the issues of costs estimation. Three papers were presented reviewing the current state of 
knowledge and exploring various methodological issues.<A HREF="/guidech1.htm#FN2">(2)</A><P>
There was a general agreement that it is possible and desirable to develop a set of guidelines 
regarding the estimation of the costs of substance use and abuse. The participants at the Banff 
symposium also agreed that these guidelines should be viewed as only the first step towards the 
development of improved and more internationally comparable estimates of the social and 
economic costs of substance use and abuse. <P>
<H3>The purposes of economic cost estimates</H3>
The need for estimates of the economic costs of substance abuse is almost self-evident. It is well 
established that the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs involves a large number of adverse health 
and social consequences. Thus, in most countries there are national policies for substance abuse, unlike 
for most other commodities. Because the justification for special regulation is the economic and social 
costs, and also because economic policy instruments are used in the regulation of these substances, it 
makes good sense to have sound estimates of the costs of substance abuse.<P>
Estimates of the social and economic costs of substance abuse serve many purposes. First, economic 
cost estimates are frequently used to argue that policies on alcohol, tobacco and other drugs should be 
given a high priority on the public policy agenda. The public is entitled to a quality standard against 
which individual cost estimation studies can be assessed. Without such a standard there will be a 
tendency by the advocates for each social problem to overbid, adding in additional items to make their 
concern a suitably high (even exaggerated) number.<P>
Second, cost estimates help to appropriately target specific problems and policies. It is important to 
know which psychoactive substances involve the greatest economic costs. For example, the recent study 
by Collins and Lapsley <A HREF="/guidech1.htm#FN3">(3)</A> concluded that the costs of alcohol and tobacco far exceeds the social costs 
from illicit drugs in Australia, thus focusing greater attention on public policy towards the licit drugs. 
Would a similar conclusion be reached in other countries? The specific types of cost may also draw our 
attention to specific areas which need public attention, or where specific measures may be effective.<P>
Third, economic cost studies help to identify information gaps, research needs and desirable refinements 
to national statistical reporting systems. Indeed, it will be argued in this report that the development of 
improved, internationally comparable methods for estimating the costs of substance abuse should be 
attempted, insofar as possible, within the framework of the existing System of National Accounts 
(SNA). This system, which is best known for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measure <A HREF="/guidech1.htm#FN4">(4)</A> of total 
market activity, is oriented towards production and market activities, and does not generally cover 
important activities which occur outside the market, or affect the quality of life, and death. Hopefully, 
national accounting systems could be expanded and modified to facilitate economic cost studies, which 
are concerned with non-market activities and mortality. The development of estimates of the costs of 
substance abuse in the framework of the System of National Accounts would be a further step in the 
improvement and refinement of national accounting systems, increasing their relevance and 
usefulness.<P>
Last but not least, the development of improved estimates of the costs of substance abuse offers the 
potential, although generally not yet realized, to provide baselines measures to determine which policies 
and programmes are the most effective in reducing the harm associated with alcohol, tobacco and other 
drug use. International comparisons of reliable cost estimates could provide important indicators of the 
effectiveness of national policies. Are the costs of alcohol consumption higher in less restrictive societies? 
Are the social costs of cannabis greater in countries where it has been decriminalised? Other things being 
equal, is there less drug abuse in countries where a greater proportion of the costs are borne by the 
individual? Ultimately, cost estimates could be used to construct social cost functions for optimal tax 
policy and national target setting. <P>
Perhaps most immediately promising is the prospect for cost estimates to be extended to more 
comprehensive cost-benefit analyses of specific drug policies and programmes. Without a national (and 
preferably international) standard, individual analyses of limited utility, because the results are not 
comparable, and their conclusions can easily become dependent upon idiosyncratic assumptions which 
the analyst has to invent.<P>
<H3>Organization of this report</H3>
The following document presents the first draft of a set of international guidelines on estimating the 
social and economic costs of substance. These should be considered a first attempt, subject to 
further revision and refinement as we develop greater experience and improved databases. The 
guidelines begin with a description of economic cost studies oriented toward non-economists. A 
detailed glossary of terms is attached as Appendix A. <P>
Section 3 presents a framework for the development of cost estimates. The major principle 
underlying the decision regarding which costs to include is the robustness of the estimates, which is 
in turn dependent on the availability of data. The matrix of factors to consider is generally limited 
to costs. It is recommended that data on benefits be collected wherever possible, and the revenue 
benefits are included in the calculation of budgetary impact, discussed in the next section. <P>
Section 4 discusses conceptual and methodological issues in the application of this framework. The 
purpose is not to advocate a particular approach, but to describe alternatives and discuss the 
advantages and disadvantages of each approach for particular purposes. The following issues are 
discussed:<P>
<UL>
<LI>definition and measurement of abuse
<LI>definition of costs
<LI>focus on adverse consequences rather than consumption <I>per se</I> 
<LI>causality
<LI>the demographic and human capital approaches to cost estimation
<LI>treatment and measurement of addictive consumption
<LI>treatment of private costs and benefits
<LI>treatment and measurement of intangibles
<LI>treatment of non-workforce mortality and morbidity
<LI>treatment of research, education, law enforcement costs
<LI>estimation of avoidable costs
<LI>estimation of budgetary impact: costs and benefits to include
</UL>
The guidelines conclude with a brief discussion of future directions, with particular attention to the 
expansion of economic cost studies to developing countries, and the implications of these guidelines 
to research agendas and data collection systems.<P>
These guidelines provide a framework rather than a rigorous methodology to be applied in every 
situation. It is recognized that there will not be sufficient data in many countries to implement the 
recommendations in this document. However, in many countries it will be possible to develop 
reasonable estimates for some, if not most, of the costs associated with substance abuse. It is hoped 
that these guidelines will help facilitate the development of more economic cost studies and enhance 
the comparability of such estimates. <P>
The guidelines are only a tentative first step in a process aimed at developing more reliable and 
credible estimates of the costs of substance abuse. The next step in this process will be to apply the 
recommended procedures in new national and regional studies. This in turn should lead to further 
refinements to these guidelines. The long-term goal is to move from cost estimation to cost 
effectiveness analyses, and eventually to cost-benefit analyses of substance abuse policies and 
programmes.<P>

<TITLE>A Layperson's Guide to the Economic Cost Estimation</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>2. A Layperson's Guide to the Economic 
Cost Estimation</H2>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
Like other professions, economists rely on a substantial body of common understanding, which they 
assume in their professional communications. As a consequence, non-economists can be confused by the 
writings and conversations of economists, even though these communications may be perfectly 
intelligible within the profession. This problem of communication with outsiders is especially unfortunate 
where the issue involves other professions, as is the case in the multidisciplinary field of substance 
abuse.<P>
Thus it is appropriate to begin the discussion of economic cost studies by elaborating for the non-
economist the implicit assumptions that the economists use. Simplification has been necessary, which 
means that some of the subtlety of the professional discourse may be lost. Obviously then, this discussion 
cannot cover all the points in the guidelines, nor does it superseded them. But hopefully it will enable 
those from other professions involved with substance abuse to have a better insight into the issues which 
trouble economists.The discussion in this section is organized around three interrelated topics: what 
economic cost studies are, what different approaches may be taken to estimating economic costs and 
what economic cost studies are <U>not</U>.<P>
<H3>Economic cost studies</H3>
In brief, the study of the economic costs of problems associated with the use of psychoactive substances 
is (1) a type of cost-of-illness study (2) in which the impact of substance abuse on the material welfare of 
a society is estimated by examining (3) the <I>social costs</I> of resources expended for treatment, 
prevention, research and law enforcement, plus (4) losses of production due to increased morbidity and 
mortality, plus (5) some measure for the quality of life years lost, relative to a counterfactual scenario in 
which there is no substance abuse. Each part of this statement bears elaboration.<P>
<H4>(1) Economic cost studies: a type of cost-of-illness (COI) 
study </H4>
The evaluation of the economic and social costs of substance abuse belongs to the genre of cost-of-illness 
studies (COI). Superficially a COI study involves combining an epidemiological database with financial 
information to generate an amount valued in monetary terms which purports to say something about the 
costs to society of a particular disease. Typically the magnitude is large, or large enough, to be used to 
draw attention to the condition as one to which policy makers, research funders, and researchers, ought 
to pay attention.<P>
It will be clear from the intensity in which economists debate each calculation, that they have in mind 
some conceptual framework. The total is not just some gee-whiz figure designed to give a significant 
place to this or that illness in the public debate. So what are economists think they are doing? Moreover, 
why do they disagree?<P>
At the heart of the economist's approach is that all relevant costs are <I>opportunity costs</I>, that is 
one activity (such as an illness) prevents resources being used for some other purpose, and so an 
opportunity is forgone. Thus COI studies rest on the proposition that if the illness were not to exist, then 
the resources that a society uses for treatment and other related purposes could be deployed in some 
other way. <P>
Sitting behind the opportunity cost is a <I>counterfactual scenario</I>, that is, a description of an 
alternative state of affairs, by which the opportunity cost would be assessed. Often the counterfactual 
proposition is not controversial. For instance we might assume in a COI study of some viral infection, 
that the alternative scenario was no viral infection. <P>
In substance abuse the alternative can be more arguable. For instance, the counterfactual to a situation of 
alcohol abuse might be that the abusers switch their consumption to mineral water and other health 
enhancing commodities, or it might be that abusers switch their consumption to narcotics. The latter is 
an extreme example, and usually a COI study assumes a switch to non-damaging activities, but 
sometimes the specific counterfactual situation is unclear.<P>
However, it is not the counterfactual proposition which causes the most dispute between economists. 
More often the disagreement arises over what should or should not be included as a cost, as well as how 
that cost is to be valued or measured. These differences do not arise because of different underlying 
fundamental frameworks, but because the common framework has been applied in different ways, so 
practical considerations have led to the treatment of the same issue in different ways.<P>
This is true for COI studies. The fundamental framework is "value theory", the role and interpretation of 
market price, which has been developed rigorously over the post-war period. Two practical applications 
of that theory are (1) in the <I>System of National Accounts</I> (SNA) and (2) <I>cost-benefit 
analysis</I> (CBA), which is a method of evaluation of alternative actions or treatments. <P>
An integral assumption of value theory is that consumers value their own consumption, and that they 
rationally seek to maximize the value of their consumption as best they can, subject to various limitations 
such as their income and borrowing power. Thus, it is assumed that when a person buys a potato, a beer 
or an illicit drug, the cost of the purchase is offset by the benefits the consumer obtains from its use. 
Many who are knowledgeable about alcohol, tobacco and drug dependence would challenge the veracity 
of this assumption. Addictive behaviour seems to violate the assumption of rational consumer behaviour. 
How then is the economic analysis to deal with this situation? <P>
One approach is to treat the psychoactive substances as conventional commodities, assuming that even 
dependent users are consuming rationally, according to their lights if not that of wiser counsel. In this 
case the perceived benefits of consumption exceed the outlay on the substance, and the transaction is 
treated as rational, just as purchases of other commodities, such as potatoes. <P>
Collins and Lapsley <A HREF="/guidech2.htm#FN5">(5)</A> offer another approach, which attempts to modify the assumption of rational 
consumer behaviour in value theory, without destroying the entire paradigm. They estimate a proportion 
of drug consumption which is judged to be abusive. For that portion of consumption, they treat drug 
expenditure by users as zero under the counterfactual scenario in which there is no drug abuse, on the 
basis that dependent users receive no benefit from use. (Indeed, many users wish they had never taken up 
drug use.) This permits them to count expenditures on drugs by dependent users as a cost in the current 
actual scenario. This is a plausible alternative, which does not undermine value theory, although it leaves 
the difficult task of determining what proportion of substance use is dependent use. <P>
The problem of how to resolve additive consumption with the assumption of rational consumer 
behaviour is not fully resolved. The key point for the non-economist is that a main objective of the 
economist's approach in economic cost studies is to retain the well-established value theory paradigm, 
but to adapt it for the consumer behaviour which addiction implies.<P>
<H4>(2) Costs to whom? -- economic cost studies in the System 
of National Accounts (SNA) framework</H4>
Newspaper stories often cite "costs" of various social problems or negative events, such as the loss of a 
business convention, the impact of poor weather on tourism or the dire economic consequences of a 
professional sports strike. Frequently, such estimates lack credibility, as costs are magnified by following 
the flow of dollars from one party to the next, with little or no consideration of alternative uses for the 
money. For example, the money spent by a tourist or baseball fan at a restaurant is counted, then the 
money spent by the restaurant to food wholesalers, then the farmer's income, as well as income and other 
taxes paid by workers at each stage, and so forth. The fact that the money spent by local residents could 
have been used for alternative purposes is not considered. It is not surprising that cost figures such as 
these are viewed with scepticism. A cost for one person is typically a benefit to another. To the business 
manager who no longer has pay for his or her staff to attend the cancelled conference, to the potential 
tourists who stayed at home and to the baseball fan whose game was cancelled by a strike, the "costs" of 
these cancelled events are really savings. <P>
In short, to be credible, estimates of the costs of substance abuse must be clear with regard to what 
constitutes a cost, who bears these costs and the boundaries which should be placed on the economic 
ramifications of negative impacts.<P>
Cost-of-illness studies are quite precise in this regard: they estimate the impact of illness on a measure of 
material  welfare in a society, closely related to the Gross Domestic Product. The GDP is generated in 
the System of National Accounts by combining expenditure and production data with accounting 
information to produce an aggregate statistic valued in monetary terms. The Gross Domestic Product is 
not an arbitrary set of decisions about what is to be included and how each item is to be valued. Rather 
the aim is to encompass all market transactions valuing them at their marginal private value (or utility), 
which is usually equal to the market price (including indirect taxes). An increase of so many monetary 
units in the GDP can be interpreted as an increase in the sum of consumer utility of the same amount of 
monetary units.<P>
In order to appreciate the significance of COI estimates in this framework, consider the counterfactual 
situation where people choose not to eat potatoes, but switch their expenditure to other products (say 
pasta). Clearly there will be a disruption among potato producers, but this will be offset by an expansion 
of pasta production. We take these two effects as (largely) balancing out, in which case there will be no 
change in GDP, even though there is a change in the composition of GDP.<P>
What, we might ask, is the cost-of-potatoes to the economy? An answer might be that it is the cost of 
production and distribution. However, this is offset by the benefits to consumers of eating potatoes. More 
formally, we see that in the counterfactual situation, where there are no potatoes (but there is more 
pasta), there is no change to GDP. So we assess the social cost-of-potatoes to be zero. Note that we are 
not here assuming that the cost of potatoes are zero to consumers. They are a real cost to them but 
it is assumed to be offset by the benefits to them of the potatoes, and which is taken into account 
when they make the (private) decision to buy them.<P>
<H4>(3) What constitutes a cost? -- social vs. private costs </H4>
Thus, where the costs of a commodity are largely limited to private costs, the economic impact is 
estimated at approximately zero. None of this should appear extraordinary. What is unusual is when we 
consider the same situation as it applies to a psychoactive substance prone to abuse, which carries 
<I>social costs</I> as well as private costs. <P>
To simplify, we shall illustrate the argument with tobacco, because it is probably the simplest of all the 
drugs, and its economic impact is the most transparent.<A HREF="/guidech2.htm#FN6">(6)</A> This time our counterfactual scenario is that 
there is no tobacco consumption, and there has been none in the past, so that smokers switch their 
consumption to some standard commodities (such as potatoes). In effect we are assuming that tobacco 
was never introduced to the society under consideration, and that potential smokers did not choose 
another drug (such as cannabis).<P>
At first it might appear that this story was no different from the one about potatoes. But tobacco 
generates ill health, which requires medical care. The lack of smoking would mean that a significant 
quantity of medical resources would no longer be need for the care of smoking induced sickness, and 
could be used for some other purposes. (It would also result in other savings, such as the cost of cleaning 
up litter and the costs of smoking-related fires.) The counterfactual is a little vague on what exactly is the 
alternative, but in the context it is not likely to matter. What is critical here is that we have a resource use 
consequent on the smoking, which is not being offset by some benefit to smokers when they decided to 
smoke. <P>
The terminology which is being used here differs from that used in most of the Economics 
literature on the subject. What we here call "social costs" are usually called "external costs" or 
"externalities" in the literature. Costs which accrue only to the people engaged in the activity in 
question (for example, the consumption of alcohol or tobacco) are called private costs. Thus the 
normal economic terminology is that private costs <I>plus</I> external costs <I>equal </I>social 
costs. It can be argued, however, that to the layperson the use of the term "social cost"  to describe 
the costs which are imposed upon the rest of society is more intelligible. Thus, in the rest of this 
publication the phrase "social cost"  has this meaning (that is, what the economist calls 
"externalities").<P>
It is sometimes suggested that these types of study should also estimate the extra value to the 
abusers (for example, the benefits to smokers of smoking) over and above the costs to them of that 
activity, and that these net private benefits should be set off against the social costs. However, 
from the point of view of public policy, it is social costs which are relevant, not private costs. In 
determining the appropriate levels <I>for society</I> of any activity, government  is interested in 
the costs which this activity imposes on the rest of the community. As an illustration, in 
determining the appropriate levels of activities such as pollution, environmental degradation or 
even violence, society does not take into account any private benefits which the perpetrators may 
enjoy. They are seen as being irrelevant to the interests of the community as a whole. In the same 
way, studies of the social costs of substance abuse should estimate only the net <I>social</I> 
costs.<P>
In COI studies, only the social costs are considered. Some of the medical costs may fall upon the smoker 
if, e.g., there is a co-payment for public care or if smokers pay higher medical insurance premiums. 
Other institutional arrangements may require similar careful distinctions between the payments the 
smoker contributes to medical care (and other expenses) and the payments from other sources. These 
costs are not part of the costs-of-illness, but a part of the private costs borne by smokers, just as they pay 
the costs of their cigarettes. <P>
The key distinction is between the <I>private costs</I> the smoker incurs by her or his own activity, 
and the <I>social costs</I> which others have incurred for them. Social costs may be incurred by other 
persons in the private sector (e.g., when private insurance premiums are increased due to payouts to 
smokers) as well as by public sector expenditure. Thus, in the context of COI studies, "social" is not a 
synonym for "public", nor "private" for "private sector".<P>
Measuring the social costs of substance abuse is no easy matter. There is strong evidence, for example, 
that the consumption of alcohol is related to a variety of health consequences. The probability and 
severity of adverse health effects of alcohol are strongly related to level of intake, often in a non-
linear fashion and sometimes in a manner which is also situation dependent (as with regard to 
accidents). The dose-response relationship is most evident with respect to cirrhosis of the liver, but 
adverse effects of high intake of alcohol have also been found for many other disorders including 
delirium tremens, impaired brain function, cancer of the esophagus and digestive tract, chronic 
calcifying pancreatitis and congenital defects in the fetus among pregnant women. High and even 
moderate alcohol use is also associated with increased risk of trauma, such as that caused by 
impaired driving accidents. <P>
The proportion of each of these causes of morbidity and mortality which can be attributed to 
alcohol use must be estimated, ideally for different age and gender groups. Where large-scale 
population based epidemiological studies have established the relative risk of particular disorders 
at different levels of alcohol consumption, the attributed fractions of alcohol-related morbidity and 
mortality can be determined with a fair degree of confidence. In many situations, however, such 
studies are lacking, and one is forced to estimate the attributable fractions from less reliable 
sources, such as studies of the excess morbidity and mortality among clinical populations. In such 
cases, one is forced to make the dubious assumption that rates of morbidity and mortality in the 
general population of heavy alcohol users can be estimated from clinical populations. <P>
For other adverse consequences of alcohol use, the issue of causality can be even more daunting. 
For example, consider a person who consumed alcohol prior to committing a crime. Even if this 
person had been intoxicated, it is not clear whether the crime can be attributed to alcohol 
consumption. The alcohol may have caused the person to become aggressive or less inhibited, or 
precipitated the crime in some other fashion. On the other hand, the person may simply have 
happened to have a few drinks before engaging in a crime which he or she would have committed 
anyway. Alternatively, the person may have already decided to commit the crime and used the 
alcohol "for courage". Thus, even when drinking immediately precedes a criminal act, the 
attribution of alcohol as a causal factor in the crime is not at all clear. <P>
Furthermore, the attributable fractions for each disorder vary between societies and within societies 
over time, so no one set of attributable fractions can be applied to all societies. Thus, the 
assignment of medical costs associated with adverse health consequences arising from the use of a 
particular substance such as alcohol is a very complicated and difficult task.<P>
<H4>(4) Further costs: productivity losses</H4>
The reduction in medical expenses in the counterfactual scenario is not the only important change as far 
as GDP is concerned. Total production may be increased because the former substance abusers are more 
productive at work, with lower morbidity and lower absenteeism. This additional production under the 
counterfactual scenario is the <I>productivity loss</I> from substance abuse in the actual 
situation.<A HREF="/guidech2.htm#FN7">(7)</A><P>
It is possible that to a certain extent, smokers may carry the burden of the lost production themselves, 
e.g. in lower remuneration. In practice, however, it seems unlikely that the entire burden of the 
productivity loss is carried by the smoker, and that at least some is carried by the employer in lower 
profits, by other employees in lower wages, and/or by the taxpayer in lower tax receipts. These losses are 
a part of the COI.<P>
<H4>(5) The ultimate "cost": Placing a value on life itself</H4>
There is one further major difference between the actual situation and that of the counterfactual which 
factors into economic cost studies. Substance use and abuse may cause death. Compared to the 
counterfactual scenario, the population is less. The resulting lower production should be included as part 
of the COI, by considering the loss of income due to premature mortality. <P>
But what are we to do about the deaths of those who are not in the workforce, such as homemakers and 
the retired? It is insufficient to ignore this loss of life due to substance abuse. There must be an explicit 
recognition of the different life years experienced under the two scenarios. As discussed in Section 4, a 
dollar value can be assigned to the labour of persons outside of the workforce, and in the case of retired 
persons, some measure of the value of life years lost must be assigned. Better still life years should be 
adjusted for the quality of the living experience. Someone suffering from terminal cancer is not 
experiencing the same quality of life as their non-smoking equivalent who is leading a full life.<P>
It is not easy to value these life years or <I>quality life years (QUALYs)</I>. Insofar as this is an 
appropriate thing to do, the difference between the actual situation and counterfactual scenario is a part 
of the COI.<P>
The notion of placing a dollar value on human life is troublesome to many. Some cultures and religions 
could not contemplate doing so. What right have economists to place a dollar value on life?<P>
Unfortunately, when it comes to policy advice, an economist cannot always avoid putting some value on 
life. Consider the question of whether to install traffic lights at a crossroad, one of which effect would be 
to reduce accidents which lead to deaths. If the evaluation ignored lives saved by the lights, that would be 
equivalent to treating the value of life as zero. As a result some life saving traffic systems would not be 
recommended. On the other hand if the value of life was set as infinity, every traffic system which 
reduced the probability of death, no matter how small that probability, would be installed, with the result 
that we could barely move given the density of life saving traffic lights.<P>
So in practice we incorporate some value of lives saved, when we make policy decisions, even if a dollar 
value is not stated. All economists are doing explicitly is what others, policy advisers and policy makers 
do implicitly.<P>
The issue of placing a value on human life cannot be avoided by ignoring the issue, for that would be 
equivalent to setting the value of life at zero. However, because economic cost studies do not strictly 
offer policy advice, they can avoid the issue by enumerating the number of years of life lost due to 
premature mortality without placing a dollar value on those years. For example, the result might be 
reported that the annual cost of a particular illness was $100 million plus 10,000 quality life years lost. 
That meaning would be that under the counterfactual scenario, there would be $100 million of extra 
resources for consumption, and 10,000 additional quality life years saved.<P>
However the cost of another illness might be $50 million plus 20,000 quality life years. Some may 
wonder which illness is the more costly, a question that can only be answered by combining the dollars 
with the quality life years in some way. Whatever way would be equivalent to putting a value on 
life.<A HREF="/guidech2.htm#FN8">(8)</A><P>
Another difficulty is that it is not clear that all life should be treated equally. This is especially pertinent 
in the context of substance abuse. Does the life of a chronically unemployed drunk driver have the same 
value as that of a young victim killed by the drunk driver? Does the life of a junkie have the same value 
as that of a productive, law-abiding citizen? The question of valuing the life of the junkie, compared to a 
good citizen, may turn out to be trivial, providing the counterfactual is kept mind. Suppose the 
counterfactual is to eliminate the substance abuse. Then the counterfactual scenario has the junkie as a 
good citizen, and her or his death is just as great a loss to society. Alternatively one might want to say the 
loss of the junkie's life is much less valuable than that of the good citizen, because the quality of life is 
lower. But, in addition, the counterfactual scenario is about the recovery of that low quality life to a 
standard one. Thus the total valuation, summing the two components, will be the same as the loss of the 
good citizen's life. The COI study includes the value of the existing damage to the life of an addict, as 
well as mortality effects.<P>
<H3>Demographic approach vs. the human capital 
approach</H3>
There are two different approaches to the estimation of the economic costs of substance abuse: the more 
widely adopted "human capital" approach and the more recent "demographic" approach. The key 
difference, discussed in detail in Section 4, concerns the manner in which the costs of premature 
mortality are treated. In the human capital approach, the lost value of a deceased worker's production is 
estimated by present earnings plus a discounted rate of future earnings. In the demographic approach 
compares the actual population size and structure to that of an "otherwise healthy" population, i.e. an 
alternative population in which there were no drug-related deaths.<P>
The key point is that these different approaches are complementary rather than contradictory. The 
demographic approach addresses the question: "Suppose there had never been any substance abuse or 
problems associated with the use of psychoactive substances?" The human capital approach addresses 
the question: "Suppose all substance abuse and problems associated with the use of psychoactive 
substances were to end today?" The human capital approach generates an estimate of the present and 
future costs due to drug-related mortality in the current year, while the demographic approach estimates 
the present costs of drug-related mortality in past and present years.<P>
Because these two alternative approaches to the estimation of the economic costs of substance abuse 
address different questions, it should not be expected that they would arrive at the same answers in all 
circumstances. During a period of increasing or decreasing consumption, one would expect somewhat 
different results. It is only during a prolonged period of stable consumption with no major impact from 
treatment or prevention programming that one would expect to achieve equivalent results. <P>
Thus, there is no need to reconcile the two approaches. The need is to be clear about their origins and 
significance. The choice depends on the counterfactual situation being addressed. The preferred 
procedure will often be to conduct economic cost studies which utilize <U>both</U> the demographic 
and human capital approach, and compare the results.<A HREF="/guidech2.htm#FN9">(9)</A><P>
<H3>What economic cost studies are 
<U>not</H3><I></U>
</I>Part of the appeal and desire for economic cost estimates of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs may 
unfortunately be based on confusion with other types of economic analyses. While useful and relevant to 
policy decisions, COI studies are <U>not</U> studies of avoidable costs, they are not studies of 
budgetary impact nor are they cost-benefit analyses.<P>
First, economic cost estimates do not indicate the amount of money and life years which could 
realistically be saved via effective government and social policy and programming. The counterfactual 
situation in economic cost studies is one in which there are no problems associated with the use of 
psychoactive substances. This counterfactual situation is hypothetical and generally not realizable under 
any circumstances. The estimated costs include both<I> avoidable</I> and <I>unavoidable costs</I>. 
Even if completely effective policies could be found with no appreciable costs for enforcement, treatment 
and prevention programming, implementation would not be instantaneous and there would still be 
lingering adverse consequences from past use of the psychoactive substances. The calculation of 
avoidable costs associated with the use of psychoactive substances is discussed in Section 4.<P>
Second, economic cost studies are <U>not<I></U> </I>studies of the budgetary impact of alcohol, 
tobacco and other drugs on governments. The costs included in COI studies are in reference to the whole 
of society and just to the government accounts. A study of the economic costs of substance abuse would 
be very useful in conducting an accounting of the budgetary impact of psychoactive substances, as it 
would provide estimates for many of the government outlays. However, government costs do not include 
all of the costs imposed on the community. Further, budget impact includes consideration of government 
revenues and other benefits, which are not part of COI studies. The relationship between economic cost 
studies and estimates of budgetary impact is discussed further in Section 4. <P>
Finally, economic cost studies do not attempt to fully consider the economic benefits of alcohol, tobacco 
and other drugs, and they should not be confused with cost-benefit analyses. Cost-benefit analysis is one 
of a range of tools economists and others use to evaluate policy proposals. In the medical area they are 
frequently used to evaluate the usefulness of a costly treatment or a policy proposal (such as prohibiting 
drinking in certain circumstances) by weighing the costs of the intervention against the benefits.<P>
Cost-benefit analysis is based on the same value theory as COI studies, and economic cost studies can be 
used to provide important cost components in a cost-benefit analysis. However there are slightly different 
assumptions which means that cost-benefit analysis may give different outcomes and estimates. The 
most important differences involve the counterfactual scenario, and the treatment of the non-market 
sector.<P>
Typically the cost-benefit analysis asks what would happen if the costs associated with a particular 
behaviour - such as tobacco smoking - were to cease from today. This contrasts with the counterfactual 
scenario in a COI study,  which is to ask what would happen if the smoking had never started. Even if all 
smoking were to stop instantly there would still be the consequences of past smoking on mortality, 
morbidity, and health care. For instance the public sector would still be required to provide assistance for 
those who smoked in the past and were in need of medical care.<A HREF="/guidech2.htm#FN10">(10)</A>  Such social costs are 
<I>unavoidable</I>, and so are not included as a cost in the typical cost-benefit analysis.<A HREF="/guidech2.htm#FN11">(11)</A><P>
The other major difference between cost-benefit analyses and economic cost studies utilizing the SNA 
framework is that cost-benefit analysis has been concerned with the impact of an event on non-market 
activities. For instance, if the a problem of substance abuse involves keeping patients in hospital beds, 
and a counterfactual scenario of returning them to the community, the cost-benefit analysis usually 
includes the extra unpaid work that might be involved in the second scenario (as when extra house and 
care work is imposed on family members). <P>
The extension of economic cost studies to cover such unpaid and non-market activities does not represent 
a major difficulty in principle, but it has not been given priority in development. If economic cost studies 
were extended to include unpaid and non-market activities and if they were able to distinguish 
<I>avoidable</I> from <I>unavoidable</I> <I>costs</I>, it would be enormously helpful for those 
who wish to carry out cost-benefit analyses of alcohol and other drug policies and programmes. For an 
economic cost estimate is almost the benefit side of a cost-benefit analysis, and if done properly it could 
be readily adapted into the full benefit side.<A HREF="/guidech2.htm#FN12">(12)</A> The reason why the COI study is close to the benefit side 
of a cost-benefit analysis is that the avoidable costs associated with the use of psychoactive substances 
represent the benefits (i.e. negative cost) in a cost-benefit analysis contrasting the current situation with a 
counterfactual situation in which a policy or programme is introduced. Thus there are potentially strong 
practical advantages to integrating economic cost studies with cost-benefit analyses.<P>
Thus economic cost studies, while based on the same value theory, involve differences with cost-benefit 
analysis. Some of those differences can be eliminated with development. There is no ultimate reason why 
the economic cost studies in the SNA framework should ignore non-market activities. Experience derived 
from cost-benefit analyses in dealing with non-market activities and estimating avoidable costs will 
hopefully inform the further development of economic cost estimates in the SNA framework.<P>

that the potential production from the greater productivity of the substance abuse is realised or, insofar that it is not, 
the potential is taken up in voluntary leisure with the same value as the additional production (and not involuntary 
unemployment).<P>
<A NAME = FN8></A>(8)  Pressed between the economic and policy logic, and cultural and religious or spiritual 
sensitivities, participants at the International Symposium on Estimating the Social and Economic Costs of Substance Abuse 
could not resolve the question of the treatment of the valuation of life. Instead it was suggested to use a deliberately clumsy 
term of <I>social gains from additional (quality) life years</I>. The term "social" is not  meant to connote a gain in a 
religious sense, but to indicate that society may (or may not) value any improvements in the quality of life as a result of 
reduction is substance abuse. In making this suggestion the proposers were aware they were putting the matter into a 
temporary limbo, rather than ultimately resolving the philosophical issue. That will depend upon a wider range of professions 
than even those at the symposium. After that resolution economists can turn to the question of the best valuation method, if 
any. In the interim a number of methods are advocated, their choice depending on the resolving the deeper philosophical 
issue.<P>
<A NAME = FN9></A>(9)  There is another variant of COI studies which might be considered a third approach. 
Manning and his colleagues (1991), in contrast to the studies by Dorothy Rice (Rice, 1966; Rice et al., 1985; Rice et 
al., 1986; Rice et al., 1990; Rice et al., 1991; Rice, 1993), strictly limits cost estimates to external costs (paid by 
others). Furthermore, Manning's external cost approach is incidence-based and utilizes a lifetime model of use. Thus 
the cost-benefit totals represent the current value of present and future substance use. <P>
<A NAME = FN10></A>(10)  Assuming that it had done so in the past.<P>
<A NAME = FN11></A>(11)  Over time the unavoidable costs diminish, so that the CBA counterfactual scenario has a 
growing stream of cost savings from the smoking cessation. Typically these are <I>discounted</I> to give a present value of 
the avoided costs. Discounting amounts to summing together all those costs, but the further a cost is in the future, the less 
weight it is given, because it is generally taken that income and spending in the future is less valuable than the same activity 
in the present. Typically the weighting involves a discount rate, whose magnitude is a matter of contention among economists, 
although there is widespread agreement that the concept is correct in principle. It follows that not only should the costs of 
medical care be estimated through time, discounting them to a <I>present value</I>, but so should other costs such as 
productivity and mortality losses.<P>
<A NAME = FN12></A>(12)  A common difference is that the treatment the evaluator is looking at, may reduce but

<BODY>
<H2>3. Towards a common framework: the 
matrix of costs and issues of 
measurement</H2>
<H3>Which substances to study</H3>
Perhaps the first issue in designing a framework of what to include in estimating the economic 
costs of substance abuse is the issue of which psychoactive substances should be covered in the 
study. There is probably no right or wrong answer in making this determination. <P>
Studies may reasonably focus on a single substance or on many substances. However, the 
determination of scope has definite implications in terms of the level of effort, the data 
requirements, and the analytic requirements. In practice, analysts have generally performed studies 
of the cost of abuse of and dependence on:<P>
<UL>
<LI>alcoholic beverages;
<LI>tobacco products;
<LI>illicit drugs (other psychoactive substances) as a group; or
<LI>alcohol and other psychoactive substances (but not tobacco), respectively; or 
<LI>alcohol, tobacco and other psychoactive substances, respectively.
</UL>
Licit drugs such as prescribed medications and over-the-counter drugs, and volatile substances 
such as inhalants, are classes of psychoactive substances of epidemiological significance in many 
societies which have not been studied from an economic perspective. This would be a very valid 
and salient dimension of the substance abuse problem to analyze.<P>
In situations where many persons use multiple psychoactive substances, it can be very difficult to 
develop estimates of the costs of particular substances. Good epidemiological and etiologic 
research should attempt to address this issue. However, the drugs and their patterns of use change 
continuously and rapidly, which makes it difficult to define and study consequences and costs 
associated with single substances. <P>
In addition to determining which substances to consider, the scope of the study may be restricted to 
a particular drug (e.g., heroin, cocaine, marijuana), a particular mode of drug consumption (e.g., 
injection, smoking or oral), or for different potencies of substance (for any drugs under 
consideration). For example, public policy is often directed at the legal issues of a particular 
substance, such as decriminalization of or increased legal sanctions for a substance such as 
marijuana or powder cocaine or "crack" cocaine; taxation on smokable versus oral tobacco 
products; and differential regulation of beer, wine and distilled spirits. In theory this should be 
possible, although it may be difficult in practice because of data limitations. <P>
The majority of economic cost studies have examined costs associated with the use and abuse of 
alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, respectively. Fewer studies have attempted to simultaneously 
analyze and compare the economic costs of multiple types of substances, or particular drugs, mode 
of administration or different potencies. Most studies of particular substances acknowledge the 
importance of examining and comparing the costs of other types of substances, but adopt a 
substance-specific focus because of limitations in time, resources or available data, or for the 
highly pragmatic reason that the funding source (often a government agency) has a substance-
specific mandate. In sum, which substances and patterns of use are studied is generally driven by 
the needs of the sponsoring agency and the limitations of the data.<P>
<H3>The major types of costs included in cost estimation 
studies</H3>
The use of psychoactive substances such as alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs involves a numerous 
and varied set of adverse consequences. Figure 1 identifies the major types of costs that have been 
analyzed in economic cost estimates to date. Some of these costs have been omitted from certain 
studies out of data limitations--not from disagreements about the theoretical correctness of 
including such costs. Each of these types of costs is discussed with regard to the potential for being 
estimated, and of thereby being included in a cost estimation study.<P>
<A NAME=Fig1></A><A HREF="/guidefg1.htm">Figure 1:  Types and examples of costs associated with substance abuse</A><P>
As indicated by the columns in Figure 1, costs may be tangible or intangible and the costs may be 
incurred by the individual user, other individuals, government or private industry. Intangible costs 
and the private costs to individual users are generally not included in cost estimation studies.<P>
This is but one of a number of different ways to categorize these cost items. Some of the cost 
categories in Figure 1 refer to efforts to "prevent" substance abuse, some are due to criminal justice 
efforts designed to "deter" or to punish problematic involvement with psychoactive substances, 
while others are the costs associated with negative consequences of using psychoactive substances. 
There are certainly other classification schemes for these costs, and the articulation of new or 
alternative formats could suggest other approaches to cost estimation. <P>
It should also be remembered that the counterfactual situation in Figure 1 is one in which there are 
no health or social problems associated with the use of alcohol, tobacco, licit or illicit drugs. The 
comparison of the actual situation to this counterfactual scenario does not consider certain 
opportunity costs which might be considered in different counterfactual situations. For example, if 
certain illicit drugs were made available via prescription or a government monopoly, there would 
undoubtedly be tax revenue for governments. Therefore some might consider lost tax revenue to be 
a "cost" of the current situation. However, the legal availability of these drugs is not the 
counterfactual situation in cost-of-illness studies, so forgone tax revenue is not considered a cost. 
In any case, tax revenue from drug sales simply represents a transfer of resources from drug 
purchasers to the rest of the community. It does not create any more resources for the community 
as a whole- it simply redistributes existing resources. Thus a loss of revenue cannot be a social 
cost, only a budgetary cost under a different counterfactual scenario.<P>
As seen in Figure 2, there are a wide variety of health problems associated with the use of alcohol, 
tobacco and other drugs. Some of these are entirely attributable to substance use, while other 
causes are only partly attributable. The proportion of, say, liver cirrhosis deaths or traffic accident 
injuries, which can be reasonably be attributed to alcohol use will vary between societies and over 
time within the same society. Therefore the choice of the appropriate attributable fraction depends 
on reviewing the most current literature on each particular cause of morbidity and mortality. There 
is no one set of attributable fractions which may be applied in any society.<P>
<A NAME=Fig2></A><A HREF="/guidefg2.htm">Figure 2: Social costs associated with substance abuse with examples</A><P>
Regardless of how the various economic costs are classified, these are costs in the simplest 
economic conception, recording the first instance of reallocation of resources in the economy. The 
key aspect of these costs is that either goods or services are used or delivered (direct costs) or 
human productivity is lost or impaired (indirect costs) due to an individual's use of psychoactive 
substances.<A HREF="/guidech3.htm#FN13">(13)</A><P>
Figure 2 does not distinguish between licit and illicit drugs. While desirable, it is very difficult to 
make this distinction because coding systems (the International Classification of Diseases, Version 
9) do not distinguish problems due to licit or illicit drugs. For many categories, both licit and illicit 
drug problems are recorded in the same category. <P>
The availability of data to estimate the following costs and concepts is often related to how clearly 
a particular type of consequence is related to substance abuse. In many cases particular services or 
problems are definitely recorded in administrative records as due to or related to substance abuse. 
Making estimates of such costs depends on gaining access to these data, and development of 
estimates will thereby be more direct and understandable to both the analyst and the ultimate user 
of the estimates. However, many adverse consequences arise from multiple causes in which 
substance abuse may or may not play a role. The analytic challenge is to obtain data that will 
provide a plausible basis for attributing some proportion of the costs associated with the particular 
negative consequence to substance abuse (the attribution factor). <P>
The following discussion focuses on whether there are likely to be sufficient data to produce robust 
estimates of the major categories of costs associated with substance abuse. It does not attempt to 
detail all of the more specific costs within each major category of costs associated with substance 
abuse. The specific problems and their associated costs will vary according to substance--alcohol, 
tobacco and other drugs have different problems associated with their use. <P>
Furthermore, the extent to which a particular consequence can be attributed to the use of, say, 
alcohol will vary according to setting, both for epidemiological reasons and due to variations in the 
institutional arrangements for dealing with adverse consequences. Thus, for example, the 
proportion of liver cirrhosis which can be attributed to alcohol will be strongly influenced by the 
rate of alcohol consumption in a society, patterns of drinking and the availability of treatment. <P>
The establishment of the most appropriate attribution factors for alcohol and other drug related 
illnesses and social problems therefore requires a detailed literature reviews for each consequence. 
See, for example, Holman and Armstrong's review of the appropriate aetiologic fractions for 
alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs (Holman and Armstrong, 1990). Although such reviews do exist, 
the appropriate attribution factors conducted in one country may not be applicable to another 
country or even the same country at a different point in time. Therefore, the conduct of a cost 
estimation study on substance abuse requires careful line-by-line consideration of the specific costs 
to include and the attribution factors for each cost which are the most appropriate for the society in 
which they applied. <P>
A further caveat regarding the following discussion of major cost categories is that it does not 
specifically address issues and methodologies for assigning values to indirect losses including 
premature mortality, morbidity and reduced productivity, crime victims' loss of work, incarceration 
and crime career losses. Studies tend to value losses of productivity using wage rates or 
replacement costs (for one's own business or for household productivity), with different values for 
individuals of different ages and genders. These issues are taken up in Section 4. The major 
objective of this section is to outline potential types of data sources and related analytic issues for 
each of the major types of costs in Figures 1 and 2.<P>
<H3>Treatment for substance abuse</H3>
This category of costs should generally have some of the most readily available data (although not 
necessarily comprehensive) about services delivered due to substance abuse. There are two reasons for this. 
First, some nations have identified publicly-supported clinics that are dedicated to treatment of substance 
abusers. Therefore, there are government maintained data about the level of services and funding that are 
delivered through such service providers.<P>
Alternatively, many health care systems collect data about the health problems for which patients sought 
and received treatment from hospitals, if not clinics, physicians and other health providers that do not 
specialize in treating substance abusers. These data are often recorded using an internationally recognized 
coding system (the International Classification of Disease, or ICD) that define alcohol- and drug-related 
diagnoses, including:<P>
<UL>
<LI>dependence on alcohol or drugs;
<LI>abuse of alcohol or drugs;
<LI>psychosis due to alcohol or drug use;
<LI>poisoning/overdose from use of alcohol or drugs.
</UL>
Thus a treatment episode or service received from a health provider can often be linked definitively to a 
substance abuse-related diagnosis and unambiguously attributed to substance abuse.<P>
In the absence of system-level data that track the causes for which medical care is delivered (e.g., Holman 
and Armstrong, 1990), the analyst will have to find "special studies" that would provide credible estimates 
of these values. For example, particular hospitals or clinics might perform studies of what disorders were 
treated, and how much care they required. Judgment will have to be exercised in extrapolating such 
estimates to the entire system. For example, data from a "teaching" hospital that serves as a referral center 
may not be typical of care delivered in many other hospitals, and it would be useful to be able to make 
adjustments to the data in order to address what may be known differences.<P>
<H3>Health treatment for comorbidities and trauma</H3>
Abuse of alcohol and drugs has been linked to numerous health problems, including, e.g., cirrhosis of the 
liver, nutritional and metabolic disorders, infection with HIV, motor vehicle and other types of trauma, and 
some mental disorders (see Figure 2). The challenge for the analyst in developing estimates of the costs 
attributable to substance abuse are two-fold. First, it is necessary to estimate health expenditures related to 
these health problems. Then, it is necessary to develop estimates of the proportion of these costs that are 
plausibly attributable to substance abuse.<P>
The ability to perform the first step depends on the development of data systems in a national health 
system. Again, where system-level studies have examined the level of services related to particular health 
problems using a comprehensive coding system (the ICD) it will be more possible to develop cost estimates 
for particular diagnoses (e.g., cirrhosis of the liver, or HIV infection). Without representative studies the 
analyst will need to make recourse to special studies (from a sample of health care providers), that must be 
used with caution.<P>
The other major challenge in developing these estimates is to estimate the proportion of costs for a 
particular health problem that are attributable to substance abuse. It is rare that standard data systems 
would have the necessary data for this purpose. Studies in the United States of America find that medical 
records and data systems generally do not record whether or not a patient had an underlying substance 
abuse disorder that is likely to have caused the "presenting" health problem. Indeed, the analyst will need to 
identify special studies that have examined the underlying causes of particular problems, collecting detailed 
epidemiological information and undertaking analyses that attempt to identify the causal roles of various 
"risk factors."  <P>
The determination of attributable risk is particularly complicated for those disorders which relate to 
consumption in a curvilinear fashion. For example, coronary heart disease is lower among low level 
drinkers than among abstainers. Due to this "J" shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and 
coronary heart disease, alcohol both causes and prevents morbidity and mortality. Economic cost estimates 
can subtract out the number of cases prevented, and thus present a net effect of alcohol on the number of 
hospitalizations or deaths due to coronary heart disease. Alternatively, the analyst may choose to ignore the 
number of cases prevented by low level consumption and present only the gross number of hospitalizations 
or deaths, on the grounds that a cost study should not give incomplete, partial consideration to benefits 
associated with alcohol consumption.  <P>
In estimating an "attributable risk" factor the analyst should carefully assess the rigor and depth of the 
research literature that is available on the role of substance abuse in a particular disorder. Studies of simple 
"association" (for example, the proportion of tuberculosis victims that were drug users) are not adequate 
for this purpose. They probably constitute the absolute upper limit of the role of substance abuse. Rigorous 
analysis will identify and adjust for the role of additional risk factors, and will almost always yield a lower 
"attribution factor" than the simple measure of association. <P>
Also, better studies of attributable risk will use rigorous statistical standards in identifying whether or not 
risk factors (including substance abuse) are causally related to the health problem under study. It should be 
emphasized that there is no single analytic methodology that is most appropriate for undertaking causal 
analysis. There are a variety of "study designs" and methodologies that can produce useful information.

<H3>Prevention and other public health efforts</H3>
The primary source of data on this item will generally be from government budgets. Many of these services 
are in the form of media messages, educational efforts and materials. However, other services and activities 
are also considered to be useful in combating substance abuse, such as after school activities for 
adolescents, and interventions with youth at risk of school drop out of failure. Consequently, funding of 
these services may be motivated by the substance abuse problem and therefore recorded as part of the effort 
to address substance abuse. However, the 1994 First International Symposium on Estimating the Social 
and Economic Costs of Substance Abuse recommended that these costs should be recorded as discretionary 
policy costs rather than as unavoidable costs of substance abuse.<P>
<H3>Premature mortality</H3>
National health systems view data about mortality as quite valuable in monitoring the health of the 
populace. Often mortality data (deaths for one or more year) are centrally collected, with information about 
the cause of death and demographic characteristics of the decedent. Cause of death can be coded for 
purposes of analysis using the ICD system. As noted above, there are identified ICD substance abuse-
related codes that can be associated with deaths. When national mortality data are collected and processed 
in this form it makes the task of the analyst relatively straightforward in assembling data on deaths with a 
direct link to substance abuse.<P>
However, substance abuse can also cause death indirectly, as discussed above under "Health Treatment for 
Comorbidities and Trauma."  As indicated previously, the challenge to the analyst is to first identify causes 
of death for which there is research substantiating a causal role for substance abuse, to obtain the data on 
mortality for the year(s) of concern related to that cause, and then to develop and estimate of the proportion 
of deaths that are attributed to substance abuse. The same analytic issues apply to studies of mortality as to 
studies of health care utilization. Greater reliance should be put on more "rigorous" studies. Studies of 
"association" should be eschewed in favor of studies analyzing the contribution of multiple risk factors that 
apply standard statistical criteria to the analysis.<P>
<H3>Morbidity--lost employment or productivity</H3>
There are real economic losses associated with illness-caused lost days of work (in paid employment, in 
one's own business such as agriculture, and in household productivity), and with work performed (in any of 
these venues) by those that have long-term or short-term impairments or disabilities. Measuring and 
attaching values to these phenomena is quite challenging for many of the same issues that must be 
addressed in estimating health care resources used to address substance abuse. This discussion does not 
address issues primarily related to valuation of lost or impaired work time, such as what is the 
unemployment rate in the nation under study. These estimates should be understood to represent lost or 
reduced "potential" work time/productivity.<P>
The first type of data concerns work time missed due to participation in treatment. Residential, hospital and 
"day treatment" patients usually miss work, and to the extent that data exist on care delivered in such 
settings it is possible to develop basic estimates of lost work time. Similarly, participation in ambulatory or 
outpatient treatment may entail some time away from work to receive treatment, and this estimate can be 
constructed with data on enrollment in outpatient treatment. These data should also include information 
about the demographic characteristics of the patients, in order to make adjustments for the "expected" level 
of employment/productivity.<P>
Another source of data would come from estimates of patient time spent in hospital and ambulatory health 
care for health problems caused by substance abuse. This would build on the same analytic literature and 
data used to make estimates for health care services above.<P>
A further  source of data for this estimate would be from studies of health and employment. For example, 
health surveys in the United States of America ask about health status, loss of work due to health problems, 
and the nature of those problems. Health problems are coded for analysis using the ICD system, and data 
can be assembled on diagnoses that are directly coded as substance abuse, and for health 
problems/diagnoses that have been established as related to/caused by substance abuse in the 
epidemiological and etiologic literature.<P>
Prior studies have found that the largest part of morbidity/lost and reduced productivity costs is not due to 
measurable lost days of work, but from impaired productivity while on the job. Numerous studies have 
found that many substance abusers hold jobs. There is a smaller, but growing literature that has yielded 
evidence that substance abusers are less productive in their jobs than individuals with otherwise similar 
experience and capabilities. <P>
Such studies use labor economics models to analyze "general population" surveys that contain standard 
labor market information as well as information about use of and problems associated with psychoactive 
substances. The objective of such an analysis is to use statistical analysis to identify patterns of substance 
use or problems that are associated with employment and earnings deficits, standardizing or controlling for 
the other characteristics of substance abusers. These estimates are then applied to estimates of the 
proportion of the population (employed and otherwise) that have these patterns of use or problems, and 
then to assign economic values to the identified deficits.<P>
This type of costs applies primarily to "health-related" impacts on employment. As will be discussed later, 
substance abuse has other avenues through which it appears to impact on labor market performance and 
productivity--mainly related to criminal activities and incarceration of criminals.<P>
<H3>Property destruction from crime or accidents</H3>
As for other cost components, there are two sets of data necessary to estimate these costs. The first is data 
on the incidence and costs of such events, and the second is a set of estimates about the proportion of the 
national total that can be attributed to substance abuse (whichever substances are under examination). <P>
National data on total incidence and costs for these impacts will generally come from, respectively, criminal 
justice system studies on the incidence and nature of crime, and from a system that tracks events such as 
motor vehicle crashes and fires. Both property and personal crime sometimes involve damage to and 
destruction of property, although this value seems to be relatively small, compared to other costs associated 
with substance abuse. On the other hand, property damage from motor vehicle crashes, fires, other 
transportation accidents (train, air) can amount to sums orders of magnitude greater than that involved with 
crimes. These data may be either maintained in a regularly operating reporting system (probably sponsored 
by a government agency), or collected through special studies performed on an irregular basis.<P>
To complete these estimates there must be research on the involvement if not the causal role of substance 
abuse in the respective causes of property damage. While reporting systems on motor vehicle (and other 
transportation) crashes do increasingly assemble and report data about the involvement of alcohol and other 
psychoactive substances, this is less likely to be true for other causes of property damage. Accordingly, 
recourse will need to be made to the epidemiological literature for special studies of these problems with the 
general caveats for utilization of such studies. <P>
Note that it would generally not be appropriate to use attribution factors for one cause of damage to 
another. Different types of crime typically involve alcohol and other psychoactive substances to varying 
degrees, and the same has been found in motor vehicle crashes of different severity. Fatal motor vehicle 
crashes have generally been found to be much more likely to involve operator consumption of alcohol than 
are non-fatal crashes. <P>
<H3>Criminal justice expenditures</H3>
As for health care expenditures, some criminal justice services are identifiably and by definition related to 
use of psychoactive substances, while others are indirectly, although still causally related to use of 
psychoactive substances. One may think of three different types of cost estimation situations with respect to 
the various types of criminal justice services: criminal justice activities completely dedicated to combat the 
consequences of use of psychoactive substances (such as a distinct alcohol or drug enforcement unit); 
activities by general criminal justice entities that address illegal use of psychoactive substances; and 
activities of general criminal justice entities to address crimes believed to be caused by use of psychoactive 
substances. Estimates can theoretically be developed for law enforcement authorities (police and 
prosecutors), courts, and corrections (prisons, jails, and community supervision of offenders).<P>
Data on criminal justice units that are solely or predominantly dedicated to address illegal use of 
psychoactive substances can usually be obtained from government sources. These are the least ambiguous 
of the criminal justice costs, if such units exist and data are available.<P>
The greater challenge comes in analyzing costs from general criminal justice entities, particularly law 
enforcement and judicial services. It is very difficult to allocate effort and costs across the different 
missions of such entities. For law enforcement there may be data about types and numbers of arrests, for 
example about infractions against alcoholic beverage laws, or drug control laws, respectively. These arrest 
data provide a first level to allocate effort and costs across various types of offenses, however this raises 
the question of how much effort and cost is involved with an arrest for each type of offense. Such data are 
likely to be unavailable, and it will probably be necessary to make and acknowledge simplifying 
assumptions about cost allocations.<P>
The most difficult cost estimates will involve making attributions of the role of using psychoactive 
substances in other types of crime such as robbery, burglary, assault, prostitution and gambling. Mankind 
has spent eons contemplating why we break social norms (commit crimes), much attention is being given to 
the use of psychoactive substances. It should be sufficient to say that data about the proportion of offenders 
that were intoxicated with alcohol or drugs when they committed a crime are only data about association, 
and provides circumspect information about causation. <P>
The analyst must be very careful and explicit in discussing how attribution factors are derived for such 
crimes. It may often come down to whether the analyst is willing to exercise their reasoned judgment and 
make an explicit assumption about the rate. If so, that assumption should be backed up by a chain of logic 
and the best data that are available. <P>
<H3>Crime victim's time losses</H3>
A material, if relatively small, share of costs is derived from lost work experienced by crime victims. 
Estimates of this type of cost depend on having data about the number of crimes experienced by victims per 
year, data about the amount of productive work time lost due to a crime (at a job, one's own business, or in 
the household), and the proportion of various types of crimes that are attributed to use of psychoactive 
substances.<P>
Basic data about the number of crimes might be accumulated and reported by criminal justice authorities 
but it should be understood that these data are probably a dramatic underestimate of the amount of crime. 
Studies have shown that the largest proportion of crimes (e.g., assaults and theft) are never reported to 
criminal justice authorities by the victims. Studies of crime victims should be used to develop estimates of 
how many crimes are experienced and what level of work disruption is experienced. Such data usually 
come from the same studies that examine property loss and destruction associated with crime (see above). 
This still requires the analyst to confront the issue of attribution of crimes to use of psychoactive 
substances.<P>
<H3>Incarceration</H3>
When individuals are incarcerated they are often partially or totally removed from the productive economy. 
This constitutes a loss of potential productivity to the economy. While this loss represents a conscious 
decision by society that is deemed to be justified to protect other citizens and punish offenders, it is 
nonetheless a withdrawal of a certain number of the populace from the possibility of participating in 
productive activities. This withdrawal, or loss, is reduced to the extent that prisoners engage in work while 
incarcerated, either for outside purposes, or to support the prison.<P>
Data about incarcerated populations (and the costs of operating those systems) should be more readily 
available and more reliable than data about law enforcement activities. Information should be collected 
about those that are incarcerated due to crimes defined as due to use of psychoactive substances (violations 
of alcohol beverage control laws, and use and trading in controlled substances) and crimes where there is 
some attribution role for psychoactive substances. In the latter case data on incarcerated persons should be 
obtained by type of offense, as the extent of involvement (and attribution) of psychoactive substances is 
likely to vary. <P>
One type of study that an analyst should seek in developing this estimate is a survey of prison inmates. 
Sometimes such studies undertake to analyze factors believed to be involved with criminal behaviors, 
included whether the individual has a history of use of psychoactive substances, or was using them at the 
time that they committed the crime for which they are incarcerated. As before, the analyst should attempt to 
arrive at estimates judged to reflect "causality" relying if possible on data and analysis, but always it will 
be necessary to use careful judgment.<P>
<H3>Crime career costs</H3>
This is probably the most esoteric and ephemeral of the costs associated with use of psychoactive 
substances, and probably the most difficult to estimate. The concept behind "crime career" costs is that 
some otherwise able-bodied and able-minded users of these substances "drop out" of the legal economy in 
order to produce or trade in psychoactive substances or to pursue income-generating crime because of the 
demands of their drug addiction. Thus there is a loss of potential production in the legitimate economy. <P>
It is extremely challenging to estimate this cost component, and it would be an understatement to say that 
the estimates would have poor statistical reliability. This estimate would probably have little or no 
statistical properties because the estimates used for this cost may have to be based on expert judgments and 
informed opinions. There have been few studies that have produced statistically rigorous and plausible 
estimates of the size of this population. <P>
Data of some nature may exist for various parts of this population, such as addicts seeking treatment or 
health care, or drug users and traffickers that are arrested. Such data can be combined to generate lower-
bound estimates of the size of the population under discussion, however, anthropological studies of this 
population find that a surprisingly large proportion of addicts have never been in treatment, sought health 
care, or arrested. Also, studies have attempted to use sophisticated statistical inferential techniques to 
indirectly estimate the size of the population (for example, the capture-recapture model, and 
epidemiological models of transmission of HIV infection among injection drug users). <P>
The analyst may need to search extensively in order to develop such estimates. Ultimately it will become a 
question of judgment about which data to use, if any, and how to combine estimates from disparate 
sources. The most meaningful test for this estimate, if it is developed, is whether it is judged to be credible--
not statistically rigorous--by those who have carefully studied the problem from various perspectives.<P>

<H3>Notes:</H3>
<A NAME = FN13></A>(13)  This approach accordingly does not address the conceptual issues associated with 
any enjoyment or benefit that consumers derive from use of psychoactive substances.  Nor does this approach deal 
with the fact that resources used to address the problems of psychoactive substances are creating new jobs--actually 
different jobs, since the funds are taken away from other uses that would themselves create jobs.  Also, the theoretical 
economic constructs of "consumer's surplus," marginal utility analysis, and social welfare functions are beyond the 
scope of this analysis.<P>

<BODY>
<H2>4. Some theoretical issues in the 
application of the framework</H2>
<H3>Definition and measurement of abuse</H3>
The definition of drug abuse is rarely attempted in the literature, and those definitions which are 
available are not usually expressed in economic terms. For example, the definition used by the 
Mayo Foundation for Education and Research defines abuse as "consumption of any drug for 
purposes other than that for what it was intended or in any manner or in quantities other than 
directed". It is certainly difficult to apply this definition of abuse to the consumption of 
tobacco.<P>
A definition of abuse which is meaningful in medical terms is  that "drug abuse is deemed to occur 
when a relevant aetiologic fraction is greater than zero, i.e. when drug abuse adversely affects the 
health of the user". A more comprehensive economic definition, which encompasses non-medical 
costs such as accidents and policing, is that drug abuse exists when drug use involves a net social 
cost additional to the resource costs of the provision of that drug. Abuse occurs if the community 
incurs net costs as a result of drug abuse.<P>
The measurement of abuse may require different measures for different drugs. The measurement of 
abuse is most straightforward for tobacco;  while most tobacco consumption must be considered 
addictive all tobacco consumption can be considered abusive since all tobacco consumption 
diminishes health status. Abusive drug consumption may be, but is not necessarily, addictive 
consumption. As an illustration, a road accident may be caused by abusive but not addictive 
consumption of alcohol. Harm minimization strategies for alcohol predominantly focus on the 
measurable effects of abuse such as health care costs and diminished health status, road accidents, 
and the costs of premature mortality.<P>
These and related data can be quantified so that economists can cost the amount of abuse which 
can be attributed to substance use, but they do not provide definitive measures on the nature and 
measurement of abuse. For example, a recommended daily amount of alcohol consumption may be 
valid on a population-wide basis, but an individual may reach a level of abusive consumption well 
before or well after the recommended consumption level. <P>
Indeed, an important issue in estimating the costs of alcohol is whether the counterfactual scenario 
is more appropriately no vs. low alcohol consumption. Different studies have adopted different 
strategies. The choice of low consumption vs. abstinence as the counterfactual can have a 
significant bearing on the relative risk of morbidity and mortality associated with higher levels of 
alcohol use. The use of abstinence as a reference category for relative risks is less complicated, but 
it may decrease the estimated relative risks of high alcohol consumption for those disorders with a 
"J" shaped curve (having lowest risk among low level consumers compared to abstainers and 
heavier drinkers). The use of low consumption as a reference category for relative risks results in 
higher estimated risks of high alcohol consumption for disorders with a "J" shaped curve, but it 
ignores significant risks associated with low level consumption for other disorders (e.g. traffic 
accidents). <P>
When endeavouring to measure the abuse of illicit drugs, even less is known. Firstly, illicit drugs 
are not a homogenous category. In addition, the convenient definition that abusive consumption is 
equivalent to illegal consumption does not provide either an accurate basis for costing or a useful 
policy tool. However, while it may be much more useful to separate those costs which are incurred 
because of the legal status of a drug e.g. law enforcement, not enough is known about abusive 
consumption of illicit drugs to produce a comprehensive measure of all other costs.<P>
<H3>Definition of costs</H3>
The economist's definition of cost is based on the concept of an alternative use for scarce 
resources, known as opportunity cost. The measure of opportunity cost is the benefit which would 
be derived from the <I>best alternative use</I> of a particular resource. For example, the 
alternative use of land which is currently used for growing tobacco is the next most valuable crop 
which could be produced on that land.<P>
A number of issues relate to costs, for which understanding of definitions is important. It is 
generally recognized that the costs of abuse include private costs and social costs, about which 
Markandya and Pearce say: "to the extent that the costs are knowingly and freely borne, they are 
referred to as private costs, but to the extent that they are not so borne but fall on the rest of society 
they are referred to as social costs".<P>
In estimating the costs of drug abuse, other types of costs which require definition include tangibles 
and intangibles. Tangible costs can be defined as those costs which, when reduced, yield resources 
which are then available to the community for consumption or investment purposes. Intangible 
costs, which include pain and suffering, when reduced or eliminated do not yield resources 
available for other uses. As much of the efforts of the health care system are focused on the 
reduction of intangible costs, it is apparent that these costs are very important, albeit difficult to 
quantify.<P>
It is also important to identify the concept of marginal cost, which is the increase in total cost 
attributable to drug abuse after allowing for the costs which would have otherwise been incurred in 
the absence of any drug abuse. In other words, this is a net cost concept.<P>
For example, in costing health care, net costs include estimates of both incurred health care costs 
and potential savings. Those health care costs which are attributable to substance abuse should be 
set against the saving in health care costs which have resulted from the premature deaths of drug 
abusers. Had the abusers not died from causes related to drug abuse they would in many cases still 
be alive, suffering from other diseases and so imposing health care costs on the community. If 
abusers were not  sick from abuse-related causes they would, in many cases, be sick from other 
causes.<P>
<H3>Treatment and measurement of addictive 
consumption</H3>
Difficulties arise in practice in estimating the proportion of consumption which is addictive, 
although reasonable estimates can be made. There are strong grounds for the belief that drug use 
by addicts does not yield private benefits.<P>
The theory of rational addiction, proposed by Becker and Murphy, implies that persons 
contemplating the possibility of acquiring an addiction maximize their utility over time in the 
knowledge of the interdependence of present consumption and future preferences<I> and with full 
knowledge of the effects of the contemplated addiction</I>. In other words, the theory requires 
that potential addicts have full knowledge of all the drug's present and future effects at the time at 
which they are deciding whether to acquire the addiction. It is, considering the medical literature on 
the nature and sources of addiction, extremely difficult to believe that addicts make rational 
consumption decisions. It is even harder to believe that potential addicts have access to, and the 
ability to evaluate, all the relevant medical and epidemiological information in advance of 
becoming addicted, particularly when so many addicts are young or became addicted when they 
were young.<P>
Ellemann-Jensen points out that total addiction has been assumed to imply that the smoker enjoys 
no utility at all from smoking but continues to smoke. He suggests that "such behaviour is clearly 
in contrast to the hypothesis of utility-maximization in standard economic theory". But, in fact, this 
is not necessarily the case. A 1991  editorial in the British Journal of Addiction suggests that 
addiction involves, <I>inter alia:</I>highly compulsive use;use despite harmful effects;relapse following abstinence;  andrecurrent drug cravings.<P>
In this circumstance, the objective of drug consumption may well be to avoid highly unpleasant 
effects of withdrawal rather than to gain any positive benefits. Since the withdrawal effects result 
from previous consumption of the addictive drug, avoidance of these effects can hardly be viewed 
as a benefit of drug consumption. Short-run utility maximization need not necessarily imply long-
term positive overall benefits from drug use.<P>
The proportion of total consumption of an individual drug which is addictive consumption varies 
from drug to drug. For example, approximately 90% of Australian tobacco consumption has been 
estimated to be addictive but it is to be expected that the proportion of alcohol consumption which 
is addictive is considerably lower. The proportions applying to the various illicit drugs will also 
vary substantially.<P>
<H3>Human capital and demographic approaches to 
estimation of the costs of substance use</H3>
Two broad approaches have been adopted to the estimation of the costs of substance use - the 
widely adopted "human capital" approach and the more recent  "demographic" approach. Both 
approaches relate to the valuation of the loss of production arising from the abuse-related deaths of 
otherwise productive members of society. Both approaches compare production and abuse costs in 
the actual situation with those in a hypothetical alternative situation which would have existed had 
there been no past or present substance abuse. The difference between the two approaches relates 
to the way in which the production costs of premature mortality are treated.<P>
The human capital approach is to estimate the value of the worker's future production stream, 
brought back to present day values by the use of an appropriate discount rate. A thousand dollars 
received this year is worth more than a thousand dollars received next year (even if there is no 
inflation) because this year's resources become available for investment purposes a year earlier and 
so produce interest receipts or profits a year earlier. The use of a discount rate acknowledges this 
fact and adjusts for the difference between present and future values. Two major problems arise in 
the human capital approach - how to forecast future production levels and how to choose the 
appropriate discount rate.<P>
The demographic approach compares the actual population size and structure with the size and 
structure of the hypothetical alternative no-abuse-population. From this comparison the actual and 
hypothetical outputs are compared to yield the production costs in <I>that year</I> of past and 
present substance abuse. The major problem in this approach is the estimation of the alternative 
population structure.<P>
The essential difference between the two approaches can be summarized in the following way. The 
human capital approach calculates the <I>present and future</I> production costs of abuse-
induced deaths which occur <I>in the present year</I>. The demographic approach calculates the 
<I>present</I> production costs of abuse-induced deaths which have occurred <I>in past and 
present years</I>. Which approach should be adopted depends, therefore, upon which type of 
information is needed. The two approaches are complementary rather than competitive.<P>
<H3>Choice of appropriate discount rates</H3>
The estimation of economic costs associated with substance abuse applies to a particularly period, 
typically a recent year. However, the effect of the counterfactual scenario may involve cost savings 
in later years. The standard economic procedure is to "discount" such costs in the future to an 
equivalent sum in the base period. The base period amount is smaller than the actual amount, even 
after adjusting for inflation, because events in the future are not given much (economic) value in 
the present. <P>
The actual discounted amount can be very sensitive to the discount rate chosen. There is no 
internationally agreed upon discount rate, and even in a single country economists dispute the 
appropriate rate. These guidelines do not attempt to resolve this issue. Instead, it is proposed that 
where discount rates are required for the purpose of estimating the costs of substance abuse, the 
study should provide several estimates corresponding to different discount rates. While the 
preferred discount rate will vary between countries, it is further suggested that cost estimation 
studies include discount rates of 5 per cent and 10 per cent among those provided in order to 
facilitate comparability to studies in other countries. <P>
<H3>Treatment of private costs and benefits</H3>
The overall costs to the community of substance use can be subdivided into private costs and social 
costs. If the costs of substance production and use are knowingly and freely borne by producer or 
consumer as the result of a rational decision-making process they should be classified as private 
costs. It can be assumed that, in these circumstances, there exist private benefits of production or 
consumption which at least equal the private costs.<P>
There are three circumstances under which the consumer will not have rationally, knowingly and 
freely borne the full costs of the substance use:<P>
<UL>
<LI>there may not be available full information as to the costs which substance use imposes on the user;
<LI>the consumer may not make a <I>rational</I> decision based upon the costs of substance use which 
must be borne by the user;
<LI>there may be no mechanism by which the costs which substance use imposes on the rest of the 
community (the external costs) can be converted into internal costs to be directly borne by the user. For 
example, it might not be possible for smokers to be forced to bear their full health costs or to provide 
recompense for the costs which they impose upon passive smokers.
</UL>
Thus, if the costs of substance use are to be classified as private costs, the following three 
conditions must be simultaneously satisfied:<P>
<OL>
<LI>The users are fully informed as to the costs which the substance use imposes upon themselves;
<LI>The users are required to bear the full (internal and external) costs of the consumption; and
<LI>The users make rational consumption decisions in the light of all the information available to them.
</OL>
These requirements are extremely stringent, so stringent in fact that the conventional approach of 
treating all abuse costs as social costs is fully justified.<P>
<H3>Treatment and measurement of intangible costs</H3>
The major intangible costs of substance use to be considered here are caused by death, pain, 
suffering and bereavement. The most important characteristic of intangible costs is that, when they 
are reduced, there is no release of production or consumption resources for other uses. For 
example, any reduction of pain and suffering, while an important  benefit, will permit no direct 
transfer of these benefits to any other person. An important implication of this characteristic is that 
there is no market in the benefits of cost reduction - the benefits cannot be bought and sold. Thus it 
is extremely difficult to place a value upon intangible costs and the temptation exists to ignore 
them. However, to do so may lead to misleading and unreasonable results.<P>
To illustrate the potential problem involved in ignoring intangibles, take the case of the costs of 
smoking. A high proportion of smoking-induced deaths occur beyond the age of retirement, in 
which case the community receives a tangible benefit (forgone consumption exceeding forgone 
production). To ignore intangible costs could lead to the conclusion that smoking, by leading to the 
premature deaths of retirees, could benefit the community as a whole. The evidence that this 
conclusion is unreasonable is that most societies devote very considerable health resources to 
extending the lives, and reducing the pain and suffering, of people of beyond working age. They do 
not cease to be of value to society simply because they cease to work.<P>
The valuation of life is quite generally attempted in many advanced countries - for example in 
benefit-cost analysis of road or rail investments. The two basic approaches to the valuation of life 
are the "human capital" and "willingness to pay" techniques.<P>
The human capital approach estimates the discounted current value of the future stream of 
potential earnings of the victim. This approach undervalues life since it takes no account of the 
value of life to the victims over and above their earnings loss. To avoid death or sickness, most 
substance users would be willing to pay much more than simply their lost future earnings. The 
human capital approach can take account of this objection by arbitrary scaling-up of the estimated 
values but the theoretical basis for choice of the scaling factor is exceedingly weak.<P>
The willingness to pay approach studies what people would be willing to pay for relatively small 
changes in the risk of death and from these figures produces estimates of the value of life. While 
this technique appears to have a much sounder theoretical basis, there still remain considerable 
difficulties in the accuracy and consistency of estimates using this approach.<P>
Furthermore, when cost studies utilize a willingness to pay method for valuing life, it is no longer 
appropriate to compare the total costs of substance abuse to the Gross Domestic Product, as the 
total value of life using willingness to pay techniques is generally much higher than the GDP. One 
resolution to this problem is to compare the results to the total value of life in a society. However, 
it may be argued that some of the cost items in cost estimation studies, such as the value of unpaid 
housework, are not included in either conventional GDP figures or in the total value of life. Thus, 
the use of a willingness to pay approach permits the inclusion of otherwise intangible costs, but the 
results cannot be readily compared with the GDP or other conventional economic markers.<P>
<H3>The positive economic impact of substance 
abuse</H3>
It is often argued (for example, by the tobacco industry) that if the industry producing the abused 
substance ceased to exist there would be a substantial social cost in terms of the resulting losses of 
output, income and employment. Thus the output, income and employment generated by the 
industry are represented as being benefits which the community receives from substance abuse. 
However, this analysis rests upon two important assumptions, both of which are open to very 
serious question. <P>
The first assumption is that, in the absence of any spending on the abused substances,  the money 
would not have been used for any other form of expenditure- it would simply have been saved. This 
is highly unlikely. Most probably the money would have been spent on other forms of consumption 
which would have yielded very similar levels of output, employment and income.<P>
The second assumption is that the resources used in drug production would have had no alternative 
uses. For example, the farm land used to grow tobacco would have been unsuitable for the 
cultivation of any other crop, and the farm labour employed in tobacco growing or in the 
manufacture of cigarettes would be qualified for no other type of employment at all. This 
assumption is also highly implausible.<P>
The question does arise, however, as to whether employment would have been available for these 
people, in a situation in which there was substantial unemployment. If, however,  as a result of the 
decline of the tobacco industry, only the <I>pattern of consumption</I> in the economy changes, 
rather than there being any decline in <I>total consumption</I>, any job losses in the industry will 
be broadly matched by job gains elsewhere in the economy. From a societal viewpoint, there is 
likely to be little change in levels of employment and unemployment.<P>
An issue related to this is the question of whether abuse-related mortality causes any production 
loss during periods of significant unemployment since, it is often asserted, the dead can be replaced 
from the ranks of the unemployed who were not previously productive. Thus, the argument goes, in 
periods of high unemployment the production losses from abuse-related mortality are low or zero. 
Again it is necessary to examine the assumptions underlying this analysis.<P>
It assumes that the skills of the dead workers can also be found in the ranks of the unemployed. 
However, one of the major characteristics of the unemployed is that they tend not have the skills 
demanded by employers. They are, in economic jargon, <I>structurally</I> unemployed. In many 
cases, therefore, the dead are not replaceable. The analysis also assumes that the unemployed are 
making no contribution to society in any unpaid capacity. Again, this is not a plausible 
assumption.<P>
A difficulty with the assumption that abuse-related mortality causes no production loss in periods 
of high unemployment is that the calculated social costs of substance abuse fall as the 
unemployment rate rises. This means that the human capital approach necessitates the forecasting 
of future unemployment rates. This is a notoriously unreliable process since unemployment levels 
are partially determined by factors beyond the control of national governments, for example, 
changes in oil prices or in technology. In practice, cost estimates of abuse-related production losses 
are almost always made on the implicit or explicit assumption that the dead are irreplaceable. <P>
<H3>Who bears the social costs of substance abuse?</H3>
The 1994 First International Symposium on Estimating the Social and Economic Costs of 
Substance Abuse concluded that it  would be desirable to indicate which community groups were 
bearing the social costs of substance abuse. A major reason for this recommendation was 
recognition of the fact that the incidence of these costs may change, even in situations in which the 
overall costs are stationary. For example, there is a significant international trend in the financing 
of health care to encourage a greater proportion of funding of health care by private individuals  
rather than by the state. Aggregate abuse cost estimates will not reveal this type of effect, whereas 
incidence estimates will.<P>
Abuse costs can be treated as a form of tax and analyzed in a similar way. The costs can initially 
bear on four broad community groups- the abusers themselves, other individuals, the business 
community and government. As examples of these types of incidence of smoking costs we may cite 
the following:<P>
<B>Abusers</B>- the physical and psychological pain of death from smoking-related 
cancers;<P>
<B>Other individuals</B>- detrimental effects of environmental tobacco smoke (passive 
smoking) and some intangible costs (All intangible costs will, by their nature, be borne by 
individuals, either abusers or others.);<P>
<B>Business</B>- production losses resulting from smoking-related mortality, 
absenteeism and reduction in on-the-job productivity;<P>
<B>Government</B>- funding of smoking-related health care.<P>
It is possible that these broad groups may be in a position to pass on the costs to some other group. 
For example, business may be able to pass on the costs of productivity losses to consumers in the 
form of higher product prices or to workers in the form of lower wages. This type of analysis is, 
however, fraught with problems since it is difficult (if not impossible) to know how costs are 
"shifted" in practice. Furthermore, all costs initially  borne by business or government must 
eventually be borne by individuals (as consumers, workers, shareholders or taxpayers). Thus, 
incidence analysis should be confined to examining the <I>initial</I> burden of abuse costs 
among the four community groups enumerated above. <P>
<H3>Welfare costs</H3>
In dealing with the welfare costs attributable to drug abuse great care needs to be taken to 
distinguish between the real resource costs of abuse and costs which are simply pecuniary costs 
(i.e. transfer payments). The welfare costs dealt with here relate to the payments borne by the state 
(such as invalid pensions and sickness benefits). Relevant welfare payments are made to the 
victims of drug abuse, their carers and dependents.<P>
Welfare cost calculations should also incorporate some estimate of the proportion of the total 
administrative costs of the social welfare system which is attributable to substance abuse-related 
welfare dependence. These administrative costs are real resource costs and should always be 
counted.<P>
It is important to ensure that there is no double counting of costs or benefits. If a person previously 
in the workforce receives welfare benefits as a result of abuse-related sickness it would be double 
counting to include in the estimate of social costs both the productivity loss and the cost of welfare 
benefits. The productivity loss is a real resource loss while the welfare payment simply represents a 
redistribution of consumption ability from the rest of the community to the abuser. However, if the 
abuser is rational and fully informed the private resource costs will be fully internalized and should 
not be counted as part of social costs. On the other hand, in these circumstances the welfare costs 
will represent an externality imposed on the rest of the community and should be incorporated in 
social costs. It is never correct to count both productivity and welfare costs. Which should be 
counted depends on the assumptions about the rationality of, and the amount of information 
available to, the abuser. All welfare costs should be incorporated in estimates of budgetary 
impact.<P>
In principle, drug abuse could lead either to increases or to decreases in welfare costs (because 
some people who die prematurely would otherwise be welfare recipients).<P>
<H3>Treatment of non-workforce mortality and 
morbidity</H3>
The valuation of production lost as a result of substance use could be taken to be the value of 
wages forgone, on the basis that wages are equal to the worker's productivity (this value is often 
taken to be average earnings) or on the basis of some estimate of average gross domestic product 
per worker. However, this approach to costing is unsatisfactory because it does not assign any 
value to the unemployed, the retired or women outside the paid workforce, since they do not earn 
wages or salaries. People not in paid employment may well be contributing output but it is unpaid 
work, and so its value is not incorporated in conventional measures of national output<P>
This issue can be clarified by use of the distinction between tangible and intangible costs. There 
will be no loss of <I>paid</I> output as a result of morbidity or mortality of the unemployed, the 
retired, or other people not in the workforce (for example, wives with children) but there will be a 
value of lost <I>unpaid</I> work, as well as the loss of life incurred by these people themselves. 
There will also be a loss of unpaid work as a result of deaths of the employed but, according to 
available evidence, this loss will on average be less than for the rest of the adult population. The 
deaths of both employed and unemployed/out-of-the-work-force will impose a social cost but the 
cost will be greater for the employed. This point is illustrated in Figure 3.<P>
<A NAME=Fig3></A><A HREF="/guidefg3.htm">Figure 3:  Theoretical Impact of Premature Mortality</A><P>
In summary, for the employed the net cost is the loss of paid output  <I>plus</I> the loss of 
unpaid output <I>plus</I> the value of life. For the unemployed or people out of the work force, 
the net cost is the loss of unpaid output <I>plus</I> the value of life. This analysis clearly 
disposes of the suggestion that society incurs no cost as a result of the premature deaths of the 
unemployed or people out of the work force.<P>
Estimates of the value of unpaid work place a value on these activities which could have been 
replaced  by an equivalent service purchased from an outside source. For, example, the child-
minding activities of "non-working" mothers might be replaced by  hired nannies. The types of 
activities to be considered here are domestic activities, childcare, purchasing of goods and services, 
and volunteer and community work. The sickness or death of people engaged in such activities will 
involve withdrawal of others from the workforce to maintain the supply of non-market services. 
Value can be placed on these activities by estimating the cost of hiring a market replacement for 
each individual function. In this way the important issue of the value of productivity of married 
women in the family home is satisfactorily handled.<P>
The use of average earnings to indicate the value of the lost output of the employed implies that it 
represents the value of the output of the sick or prematurely dead. In practice, average earnings 
may be below the value of output because of labour market imperfections or because the workers 
involved are not paid the full value of their output. In addition, weekly earnings as measured by 
national statisticians tend to omit some important components of earnings, for example 
superannuation and fringe benefits, and the incomes of proprietors and partners of unincorporated 
business and of self-employed people. Adjustments should, therefore, be made for those other 
components of income.<P>
<H3>Treatment of research, education and law 
enforcement costs</H3>
Some costs which are clearly attributable to substance use result from public decisions to reduce 
abuse rather than being the direct effects of substance use. Costs in this category include 
expenditures on research on the impact of substance use, public education campaigns to minimize 
use or abuse, and law enforcement programs to reduce illegal dealing and use. These costs are 
discretionary in the sense that governments could choose not to incur them, or, indeed, to incur 
higher levels. It is to be expected that reduced expenditures would lead to higher direct costs of 
substance use but these expenditures are, nevertheless, not themselves direct costs.<P>
It is appropriate to indicate the level of social costs incurred in these expenditure areas but to 
categorize them as "policy costs" rather than direct costs. They are, in this way, identified as being 
incurred in relation to substance use but are not classified as unavoidable costs of use.<P>
<H3>Estimation of avoidable costs </H3>
It is assumed that the hypothetical alternative situation in which there is no drug abuse is simply 
that:  hypothetical and not realizable under any circumstances. Estimates of the <I>total </I>costs 
of drug abuse comprise both avoidable and unavoidable costs. Unavoidable costs comprise the 
costs which are currently borne relating to drug abuse in the past, together with the costs incurred 
by the proportion of the population whose level of drug consumption will continue to involve costs. 
Avoidable costs are those costs which are amenable to public policy initiatives and behaviour 
changes.<P>
An estimate of the percentages of mortality and morbidity which are avoidable was made in a 
comparative study by Armstrong in 1990. Armstrong uses an "Arcadian normal", which is the 
lowest age-standardized mortality rate for the relevant mortality or morbidity category amongst 
twenty selected, comparable Western countries. He implies that the Arcadian normal is the lowest 
percentage of preventable morbidity and mortality yet achieved in any of the chosen countries. This 
could suggest that no further improvement is possible. This appears to be an extremely 
conservative assumption, but nevertheless is a very useful tool for quantification of the percentage 
of preventable morbidity and mortality and their associated costs which can be reduced, and 
ultimately avoided.<P>
Some of the identified costs of abuse, while avoidable, may be reduced or eliminated only over long 
lead times, which can be considered in three categories. Firstly, policy implementation lead times 
will not be effective instantaneously<I>.</I> 	Secondly, even after full and effective 
implementation of policies, there will be long lead times before the heath effects of policy changes 
are achieved. For example, when previously heavy smokers stop smoking, it takes some years 
before their health status is equivalent to a comparable non-smoker. Thirdly, as some costs apply 
to premature mortality, it will be years before the population structure reflects the avoidable 
reduction in abuse, and the associated avoidable costs.<P>
<H3>Budgetary impact of substance use</H3>
In addition to the call which substance use places on real resources, it puts pressure on government 
budgets as a result of the need to fund such expenditures as health and welfare. However, the use 
of substances such as alcohol and tobacco produces government revenue, mainly as a result of the 
high consumption and excise taxes which they bear in many countries. Calculation of the impact of 
substance abuse on government budgets, therefore, involves estimating both expenditures and 
revenues resulting directly or indirectly from substance use in a particular time period.<P>
On the outlay side of the drug budget there will clearly be increased expenditures attributable to 
substance use but there will also be some reductions so attributable. In particular, the premature 
mortality resulting from drug use will lead to some reduction in welfare and health expenditures. 
Net health and welfare expenditures attributable to substance use will almost certainly be positive 
even after these "savings" are taken into account.<P>
On the revenue side, in addition to the evident gains there will also be losses in revenue. Premature 
mortality will lead to reduced output, incomes and consumption and so to reductions in revenue 
from personal income tax, company income tax and indirect taxes. The major components of a 
drug abuse budget are presented below in Figure 4.<P>
<A NAME=Fig4></A><A HREF="/guidefg4.htm">Figure 4:  A Drug Abuse Budget</A><P>
It is important to understand that the results of these calculations do not indicate whether or not 
substance users cover all the costs that they impose on the rest of the community. This is because 
some of these "external costs" do not show up as government expenditures (for example, the loss 
of production resulting from the health effects of passive smoking). It cannot be argued, for 
example, that "smokers pay their way" simply on the basis that tobacco-related tax revenues 
exceed tobacco-related public expenditures.<P>

<TITLE>Guidelines for Estimating Economic Costs of Substance Abuse - Summary and 
Conclusions</TITLE></HEAD>
<H2>5. Summary and Conclusions</H2>
This document has presented proposed guidelines for estimating the economic costs associated with 
substance abuse. The purpose of these guidelines is to improve the validity and comparability of 
cost estimates in different societies. The development of improved cost estimates also offers the 
potential to develop more complete cost-benefit analyses of policies and programmes aimed at 
reducing the harm associated with the use of psychoactive substances. <P>
A general framework has been proposed for the development of cost estimates. It has been argued 
that economic cost studies should be conducted within the framework of cost-of-illness studies. In 
cost estimation studies, the impact of substance abuse on the material welfare of a society is 
estimated by examining the social costs of treatment, prevention, research, law enforcement and 
lost productivity plus some measure of the quality of life years lost. It is recognized that data are 
frequently lacking for many of these costs. However, in many countries it will be possible to 
develop reasonable estimates for some, if not most, of the costs associated with substance abuse. 
Thus, these guidelines should be viewed as a framework rather than a rigorous methodology to be 
applied in every situation. <P>
An intriguing possibility is the development of special "satellite accounts" in the System of National 
Accounts (SNA) to estimate the costs of substance abuse. In 1993 those concerned with defining the 
SNA framework issued a new manual, which included the concept of satellite accounts.<A HREF="/guidech5.htm#FN14">(14)</A> Its chapter 
11 sets down criteria for satellite analysis and accounts. Their initial concern is better representing the 
physical environment in the SNA, but they will also be used for characterizing the behaviour of non-
market activities, such as housework. It would also seem a sensible development in COI studies in 
general, and those involving substance abuse in particular, to develop them in a satellite SNA account 
framework, as far as that is possible.<P>
The long-term goal of developing special satellite accounts for substance abuse would necessarily 
involve adjustments to the manner in which economic cost studies are conducted as well as adjustments 
to the SNA.<A HREF="/guidech5.htm#FN15">(15)</A> The extension to satellite accounts would almost certainly speed up the development of 
measurement and tabulation of non-market activities, but at present it remains underdeveloped. Insofar 
as cost-of-illness studies want to use a SNA framework, and incorporate the impact on the non-market 
sector, they will find themselves in the forefront of the development.<P>
As stated at the outset, the guidelines are only a tentative first step in a process aimed at developing 
more reliable and credible estimates of the costs of substance abuse. The next step in this process 
will be to apply the recommended procedures in new studies, which will hopefully lead to further 
refinements to the guidelines. Hopefully, these guidelines will even be of use to researchers in 
developing countries. The long-term goal is to move from cost estimation to cost effectiveness 
analyses, and eventually to cost-benefit analyses of substance abuse policies and programmes. In 
the meantime, the development of improved economic cost estimates will help to give substance 
abuse issues their appropriate priority on policy agendas, provide useful information for targeting 
interventions, and help to identify information gaps.<P>

the meeting are gratefully acknowledged. <P>
Special mention should be made of Jacques LeCavalier for the central role he played in 
coordinating and organizing the symposium, and for his enthusiastic promotion of the development 
of these guidelines. The gracious hospitality given the conference participants by co-hosts Len 
Blumenthal and the staff of the Alberta Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Commission and Ziggy 
Malynewski of Canada's Drug Strategy Secretariat, is also gratefully acknowledged.<P>
David Collins, Henrick Harwood, Helen Lapsley, and Alan Maynard brought their vast experience 
in conducting economic cost studies and they  prepared background paper reviewing the current 
state of knowledge and exploring various methodological issues. Along with Brian Easton and Eric 
Single, they also served on a Working Group which drafted this document. The Australian 
Department of Human Services and Health funded the participation of David Collins and Helen 
Lapsley, the Alcoholic Liquor Advisory Council funded the participation of Brian Easton and the 
National Institute of Drug Abuse funded Henrick Harwood's participation.<P>
These guidelines are truly a collaborative effort. The first two sections of these guidelines are 
based in large measure on planning documents prepared by Eric Single and "A Layperson's Guide 
to the Evaluation of Social and Economic Costs of Substance Abuse" by Brian Easton. The 
description of a common framework for economic cost studies in Section 3 draws upon material 
from all three of the background papers presented at the conference, but it is based mainly on a 
working paper by Henrick Harwood entitled "Selected Issues and Parameters In the Design and 
Performance of Cost-of-illness Studies for Substance Abuse". The detailed discussion in Section 4 
of the issues involved in the application of this framework, which also draws upon the background 
papers, is based mainly on a working paper by David Collins and Helen Lapsley entitled 
"Technical Issues in Abuse Cost Estimation". The concluding section of these guidelines represent 
a collaboration of all members of the Working Group. Appendix A, the "Glossary of common terms 
used on economic cost studies", was written by Brian Easton and Robert Bowie.<P>

purposes are the household, public, producer, and (perhaps) rest-of-world sectors - it may be useful to split the COI estimate 
into these components. It makes sense to separate out an account for the drug users from the household account, and it will be 
as useful to separate the production activities of the drug suppliers out from the producer account. Fully elaborated, there will 
be interaction between the subsidiary tables, as when the taxes paid by the user (if any) will be payments in the private user 
account, and a receipt in the public sector account. Ideally the accounts could be set out so their net balance is equal to the 
COI.<P>

<TITLE>Glossary of common terms used in economic cost studies</TITLE></HEAD>
<H2>Appendix A: Glossary of common terms 
used in economic cost studies</H2>
Each discipline has its own terminology.<A HREF="/guideapp.htm#FN16">(16)</A>  In a growing interdisciplinary area as is the evaluation of 
substance abuse, such terminology while necessary can be a hindrance. The following glossary is of 
terms which have come up in the course of the work thus far. The glossary is confined to terms used in 
the various papers and does not claim to be comprehensive, or to replace more extensive dictionaries of 
health economics.Wherever possible a standard dictionary term is used. Where there are a variety of 
definitions we have used the one which corresponds most closely to that in the papers.In some cases 
where the term is relatively new and/or contentious, or will be unfamiliar to the non-specialist economist, 
there is some elaboration of its meaning. We have clustered some common terms, often opposites, 
together so the reader can gain a better idea of the distinction or contrast that is being sought. Words in 
bold in the text have their own reference.<P>
<I>Brian Easton and Robert Bowie</I><P>
<B>abuse</B> see<B> use</B><P>
<B>addiction &amp  dependence</B> can be treated as synonymous in the case of drugs/substances. 
Addiction is defined by Jacob and Fehr as "a state of dependence upon a drug substance which 
is harmful to physical or mental health, social wellbeing, and/or economic functioning". This 
poses a problem for economists as to what extent the phenomenon involves 
<B>irrationality</B>.<P>
<B>avoidable costs &amp  unavoidable costs</B>. In the context of cost-of-illness studies 
<B>avoidable costs</B> are those which could be avoided in the future if the appropriate 
treatment or policy were to be implemented. However some costs are the result of actions taken 
in the past, and are <B>unavoidable</B>, despite the new treatment or policy. If everyone 
stopped smoking, there would still be <B>morbidity</B> and <B>mortality</B> effects from 
the physiological damage of past smoking. The continuing costs of these would be unavoidable. 
Avoidability depends in part on the time period under consideration--the longer the time period, 
the greater the proportion of costs which are avoidable.<P>
<B>benefit cost analysis</B> see <B>cost-benefit analysis</B><P>
<B>benefits</B> see <B>costs</B><P>
<B>consequences/causality/costs</B> is a summary of the three step process in the Harwood paper for 
the framework for <B>cost-of-illness studies</B>. The elaboration is- identify the tangible 
consequences attributable to substance abuse;- document causality between substance abuse 
and the consequences, and quantify frequency;- assign economic values.Maynard <I>et al</I> 
use a parallel <B>identification/measurement/valuation</B> framework.<P>
<B>core &amp  non-core</B>. <B>Core </B>costs in relation to substance abuse are those which 
occur primarily within the domain of the health system, while <B>non-core</B> costs occur 
outside it. The public health sector is a part of the <B>core</B>, but so is the private health 
sector. See <B>institutional arrangements</B>.<P>
<B>cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness analyses &amp  QALYs</B>. <B>Cost-benefit analysis</B> 
(CBA), also known as <B>benefit-cost analysis,</B> involves the enumeration and evaluation 
in terms of a common unit, usually money, of all <B>opportunity costs</B> and 
<B>benefits</B> of taking a particular action. The costs and benefits are measured from the 
societal viewpoint, and usually ignore the distribution within the nation. If the benefit of an 
action exceeds the costs then there is a sense in which it is in the interests of the nation to take 
that course. Where there are costs and benefits occurring through time, the method involves 
<B>discounting</B>. <B>Cost-effectiveness analysis</B> (CEA) is the procedure for 
identifying the least-cost means of pursuing a particular objective. For instance there may be 
two (or more) treatment alternatives. A CEA would evaluate which treatment produced the 
given outcome using least resources. <B>QALYs</B>, or quality adjusted life years, 
sometimes used in CEA's, measure any years of life gained from a treatment adjusted for 
consequential changes in the quality of the life as the result of an improvement in the enjoyment 
of the years from reduced pain, increased mobility, and so forth. <P>
<B>cost-effectiveness analysis</B> see <B>cost-benefit analysis</B><P>
<B>cost-of-illness analysis</B> (COI) asks what are the total costs incurred by a particular illness. 
Since  the cost measure is an <B>opportunity cost</B>, they in effect ask what would be the 
resources released to society if the illness did not exist. Thus the cost-of-illness is related to the 
benefits in a <B>cost-benefit analysis</B>. The economic and social costs of substance abuse 
are a cost-of-illness analysis.<P>
<B>costs, opportunity costs, historical costs, &amp  benefits</B>. <B>Opportunity cost</B> is the 
value of a resource in its most highly valued alternative use. It is the concept economists use 
when valuing costs. They ask if a resource is not used for this purpose what is its value in the 
next best purpose. In a competitive market in which all goods are traded and where there are no 
market imperfections, the opportunity cost of a resource is revealed by its market price. 
However these assumptions do not always hold, as when the resource is not bought and sold--it 
is <B>non-market</B>. Sometimes payments which appear to a layperson to be costs are not 
opportunity costs, and are left out of the calculations or calculated in a different way. e.g. 
<B>historical costs </B>and <B>transfers.</B> <B>Historical costs</B> reflect the past 
payments for a resource, but they may not represent the <B>opportunity cost</B>. If some 
medical equipment it is now useless, its opportunity cost is zero or the scrap value, while its 
historical cost is the cost of purchase, less depreciation. <B>Benefits</B> are the gains, before 
costs are deducted, of any particular course of action, preventive program, therapy, treatment, 
etc. They are usually valued in money terms. Ideally the valuation is <B>willingness to 
pay</B>. <P>
<B>counterfactual propositions </B>are the situation which the economist sets up as the alternative to 
the current one in order to assess the <B>benefits </B>and <B>opportunity costs</B> (e.g. 
for a <B>cost-benefit analysis</B>) of a different policy, treatment or circumstance. For 
instance the economist may be investigating the policy of raising taxes on alcohol, or of a new 
treatment regime for a narcotic, or the situation in which tobacco had never been available. 
<B>Cost-of-illness studies </B>have the counterfactual proposition that the illness does not 
occur. There may be more than one counterfactual proposition to a situation, so the results may 
be very sensitive to the exact assumption. For instance, it could be argued that the 
counterfactual to a situation without alcohol is greater use of narcotics.<P>
<B>demographic approach &amp  human capital approach</B>. The <B>demographic 
approach</B> (Collins and Lapsley, 1991) involves the <B>counterfactual proposition</B> 
of what would have occurred to the population if the illness (or whatever) had never occurred in 
the past. It is essentially a <B>retrospective </B>approach, and reflects a <B>national 
accounting</B> method. The <B>human capital approach</B> used extensively in cost-
benefit analyses (Harwood, 1994) involves tracing the future effects of the change in policy (or 
whatever) on the population. Its counterfactual proposition is about what would happen if the 
illness ceased from the present, and values future gains by <B>discounting</B> to the present. 
It is essentially a <B>prospective</B> approach. <P>
<B>dependence</B> see <B>addiction</B><P>
<B>direct costs &amp  indirect costs</B>. In health economics <B>direct costs</B> are usually the 
costs to the <B>core</B> health system. <B>Indirect costs</B> are those incurred elsewhere, 
notably but not exclusively <B>productivity lost</B>. However elsewhere in economics the 
terms refer to variable costs and fixed costs respectively, and these (or other) definitions 
sometimes are used in health economics.<P>
<B>discount rate</B> see <B>discounting</B><P>
<B>discounting, discount rate, &amp  present value</B>. <B>Discounting </B>is the procedure by 
which a flow of benefits or costs incurred or accruing at different points in time is expressed as 
an equivalent money sum at a single point in time, normally the present. It is especially 
important where there is an investment element to the activity. Discounting involves the use of a 
<B>discount rate</B>, which is difficult to measure or agree upon. In principle the discount 
rate is the rate of exchange between money sums at different times, in effect an interest rate. In 
the case where the sum is discounted back to the current date, it is called the <B>present 
value</B>.<P>
<B>double counting, insurance. Double counting</B>, the phenomenon where a resource is included 
in a total more than once, needs to be avoided. For example <B>insurance</B> spending has to 
be split into two components. The first is the actual cost of administering the scheme, the 
<B>transaction cost</B>. The second is the payment to the insured. This benefit is offset by 
the cost in the insurance payment. It would be double counting to include the insurance payment 
(except for the transaction costs) such as for motor vehicle coverage, and also the cost incurred 
by the payment the insurance covered, such as the cost of car repairs.<P>
<B>external costs</B> see<B> internal costs</B><P>
<B>gross costs &amp  net costs</B>. <B>Gross costs </B>consists of all costs, and ignore any 
offsetting <B>benefits</B>. If the benefits are deducted the remainder are <B>net costs</B>. 
In the event of a net cost being negative (i.e. benefits exceeding gross costs), there is a net 
benefit.<P>
<B>human capital approach </B>see <B>demographic approach</B><P>
<B>identification/measurement/valuation </B>is the summary of the three step process used in 
<B>costs of illness</B> studies (Maynard et al., 1994). The elaboration is- which elements to include in 
the work;- how to measure the effects in each area over the relevant time period;- how to value these 
effects in a common unit of account.Harwood (1994) uses the parallel 
<B>consequence/causality/cost</B> framework.<P>
<B>illicit drugs &amp  licit drugs</B>. It is usually unlawful to possess or use <B>illicit drugs</B>, 
which typically include narcotics. <B>Licit</B> drugs are those whose use is generally lawful, 
and usually include alcohol and tobacco (although in some countries alcohol consumption is 
unlawful). Note that it is possible to misuse a licit drug, as occurs with some prescription 
drugs.<P>
<B>incidence, prevalence &amp  point prevalence</B>. <B>Incidence</B> is the number of 
instances of illness commencing, or of persons falling ill, during a given period for a population. 
It is about new events. <B>Prevalence</B> is the number of instances of a given disease or 
other condition in a given population at a designated time. If the period is not mentioned, the 
concept usually refers to the situation at a specified point in time, that is <B>point 
prevalence</B>.<P>
<B>indirect costs</B> see <B>direct costs</B><P>
<B>insurance</B> (treatment of) see <B>double counting</B><P>
<B>intangible costs</B> see<B> tangible costs</B><P>
<B>internal costs &amp  external costs</B>. Economists usually assume that individuals make 
decisions in their own interests. The costs and benefits taken into account are <B>internalized 
</B>while those which are ignored are <B>external</B> to the decision. These externalities 
occur when the individuals making decisions ignore the consequences of their decisions for 
others. A complication is that while internal costs are <B>private </B>costs to the decision-
maker, some of the external costs may be private costs to others. The complement of private 
cost in the context of these studies is <B>social </B>cost, some of which may be in the private 
sector. <P>
<B>irrational </B>see<B> rational</B><P>
<B>licit drugs </B>see <B>illicit drugs</B><P>
<B>market &amp  non-market</B>. The point of this distinction is to observe that while many 
<B>costs</B> and <B>benefits</B> occur <B>tangibly </B>in the market others, of 
sometimes greater importance, occur outside it. This includes <B>intangibles</B> but also 
activities in the household and elsewhere such as carework and housework, which are not paid, 
but nevertheless involves the resource of labour effort (and which may be diverted from the 
market).<P>
<B>morbidity </B>is any subjective or objective departure from a state of physiological or 
psychological well-being. (Sickness, illness, and morbid condition are synonyms in this sense.) 
<P>
<B>mortality </B>refers to death.<P>
<B>national accounts</B> are a system of analysis the production, distribution, expenditure, and 
financing of a nation. In recent years the international standards have been extended from a 
primary concern on <B>market </B>activities, to cover <B>non-market</B> ones such as 
the environment and housework. Some features of <B>cost-of-illness</B> studies can be seen 
to be in a national accounting framework.<P>
<B>net costs </B>see <B>gross costs</B><P>
<B>opportunity costs</B> see <B>benefits</B><P>
<B>point prevalence </B>see <B>incidence</B><P>
<B>present value</B> see <B>discounting</B><P>
<B>prevalence </B>see <B>incidence</B><P>
<B>private, public, and social costs</B>. <B>Private costs</B> have two meanings in the economics 
literature. They may refer to the costs considered by the single private decision maker 
(<B>internal costs</B>), or they may refer to the costs of those in the private sector, not 
carried by the public sector. As a rule <B>public costs</B> refer to costs in the public (i.e. 
government) sector. The complement of private costs in the first sense of the private decision 
maker is usually <B>social costs</B>. Because there is no uniformity of definition, the terms 
"public" and "private" should always be treated with care.<P>
<B>productivity loss</B>. As a result of illness a person may be less productive because of higher 
absenteeism or lower output on the job. This loss of production is included in the <B>costs of 
illness</B>. In principle loss of productivity should cover consequences outside the 
<B>market</B> economy, such as reductions in human carework and housework by the sick 
person. <P>
<B>prospective &amp  retrospective</B>. A <B>retrospective</B> analysis typically involves a 
<B>counterfactual</B> proposition about an event which might have occurred in the past as it 
impacts on the situation today, whereas a <B>prospective</B> analysis asks about the effects 
of a counterfactual event with effects which begin at the point in time of the analysis (or shortly 
after) and with consequences into the future.<P>
<B>public costs</B> see <B>private costs</B><P>
<B>QALYs (quality adjusted life years)</B> see <B>cost-benefit analysis</B><P>
<B>quantifiable &amp  non-quantifiable</B> Many benefits and costs are directly 
<B>quantifiable</B> (or measurable), or can be indirectly quantified. However in the case of 
some of the most important - often <B>social</B> - ones, it is not possible to do so, and these 
are called <B>non-quantifiable</B>. Sometimes ad hoc methods are used to put estimates on 
non-quantifiable costs, rather than leave them out of the evaluation altogether.<P>
<B>rational, non-rational &amp  irrational</B>. Economics assumes that individuals are generally 
<B>rational</B>, pursuing their own best interests as best they can. ("Bounded" rationality 
recognizes they may not have the information, time, or best decision strategies to do so - that 
decision making involves costs.) Note that the <B>internal </B>decision may ignore the 
<B>external</B> costs to others. However the existence of <B>addiction </B>and <B>drug 
abuse</B> may suggest that sometimes individuals act <B>irrationally,</B> failing to pursue 
their own best interests, even in a bounded way. Collins and Lapsley explore this issue further in 
the section on addictive and non-addictive consumption. Their conclusion is that where drug 
consumption is irrational, the expenditure on the drugs is not a benefit to the individual and 
hence is a part of the total costs of abuse.<P>
<B>retrospective </B>see <B>prospective</B><P>
<B>social costs</B> see <B>internal costs</B> and <B>private costs</B><P>
<B>tangible &amp  intangible. Tangible</B> costs and benefits are those which can be easily 
measured in money terms. <B>Intangible</B> ones cannot be so easily measured, although it 
is often useful to make an attempt to do so (perhaps using a <B>willingness to pay</B> 
approach). Very often the intangible costs involving changes in quality and length of life prove 
to be more important in the valuation than the tangible ones. <P>
<B>transfers or transfer payments</B> (such taxes, subsidies, and welfare payments) do not relate to 
resource costs, so that the cost to one person is exactly offset by the benefit to someone else (as 
when somebody's tax is another's social security payment). It would be <B>double 
counting</B> to include the transfer payment as a cost, but not to offset the contribution. Again 
<B>transaction costs</B> may be relevant.<P>
<B>transaction costs</B> are those costs involved in a transaction. They include any costs for 
administering the transaction (e.g. the government and private compliance costs of the tax 
system), plus any losses from behavioural responses (as when taxpayers reduce effort because 
of higher tax rates). The past practice has been to assume transaction costs may be neglected 
because they are small. They may not be.<P>
<B>unavoidable costs</B> see <B>avoidable costs</B><P>
<B>use &amp  abuse</B> Economists tend not to judge the usefulness of the <B>use</B> of a 
product or substance to the user, other than in terms of the user's assessment. However the 
existence of <B>addiction </B>and <B>irrational behaviour</B> would seem to undermine 
that assumption. Other disciplines seem not to have a rigorous definition of <B>abuse</B>. A 
medical definition might be "drug abuse is deemed to occur when a relevant aetiologic fraction 
is greater than zero, i.e. when drug abuse adversely affects the health of the user". Economists 
tend to assume that a rational user takes this detriment into consideration when they are making 
the use decision. Sometimes the term is used pejoratively. Abel's <I>Dictionary of Alcohol Use 
and Abuse</I> remarks, no doubt ironically, that alcohol abuse is "consumption to the point 
where it results in social disapproval", which is the sort of judgement that economists' try to 
avoid. Even so the term may be used as a short-hand for some longer concept which is carefully 
defined. For instance Collins and Lapsley define the term in their paper as "when the use of a 
drug or substance imposes social [external] costs in addition to private [internal] costs", and 
devote an entire section to refining their definition.<P>
<B>value of life</B> recognises that the effect of a treatment (or policy) may be to save lives, and that 
this effect should be included in a <B>cost-benefit analysis</B>. Otherwise the analysis would 
ignore life enhancing treatments, and comparisons would favour those which made no such 
comparisons. On the other hand the notion of putting a finite sum on the "value of life" might 
seem offensive. To put an infinite sum, however, would mean that there could be no trade-off 
for improvements in the quality of life. For example a CBA would be likely to favour a zero 
speed limit for cars if the value of life was infinite. The study's approach has favoured the 
replacement of a value of life concept with a <B>social gains from additional life years</B>. 
Whichever concept is used, it is difficult to get an agreed value for the item. A description of 
approaches for estimating the value of life will be found in the Maynard <I>et al</I> 
paper.<P>
<B>willingness to pay</B> is a measure of benefit opportunity cost, especially where an 
<B>intangible</B> is involved. Measurement can involve polling individuals, asking what they 
would be prepared to pay for the resource or outcome. There is a growing body of empirical 
studies - such as using surveys - which attempt to measure the willingness to pay. <P>

The CCSA National Working Group on Policy was originally established at the request of the 
now defunct Federal Provincial Advisory Committee to monitor policy issues, prepare policy 
discussion documents and  help coordinate substance abuse policy across Canada.  It is a small 
group with representatives from addictions agencies, governments and NGO's.  Members fund 
their own participation.  Draft documents are widely circulated for comments.  The CCSA 
Board of Directors formally adopts the final version as the Centre's position on any given issue.

The CCSA monitors developments in substance abuse policy, and regularly develops policy 
discussion papers on key substance abuse issues, in accordance with the "Guidelines for 
Substance Abuse Policy" and the policy development process, both of which have been 
approved by the CCSA Board. <P>

<H4><A NAME = Harm></A>Harm reduction and alcohol</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Lead staff: Eric Single
</UL>
The trend toward harm reduction in illicit drugs is closely paralleled by a similar trend in alcohol 
prevention toward measures aimed at reducing the consequences of heavy drinking occasions.  
In a series of articles and presentations, this trend is monitored and discussed.  Examples of 
harm reduction measures are given, including measures to reduce non-beverage alcohol 
consumption by Skid-row inebriates, measures to reduce intake of alcohol by drinkers (e.g., 
promotion of low-alcohol beverages, server training programmes) and measures to reduce the 
consequences of intoxication.  Supporting empirical evidence is also presented from recent 
Canadian national surveys on the relative impact of heavy drinking occasions on drinking 
problems, indicating that it may be more effective to target prevention programming toward 
reducing heavy drinking occasions rather than the individual's level of drinking.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Lead staff: Eric Single 
</UL>
In May 1994, the first International Symposium on the Social and Economic Costs of 
Substance Abuse was held in Banff, Alberta. The purpose was to achieve international 
consensus and develop guidelines on preferred methodologies for estimating the costs of 
substance abuse, to promote the implementation of such methodologyies, and to identify what 
other steps, if any, are required to expand the concept of economic costs studies in the 
international community. It was also agreed that CCSA should hold another meeting in 15 
months time to focus on the implementation of the guidelines and further advance the 
methodology. <P>

CCSA convened a meeting of DAW organizers from across Canada in April 1991 to look for 
ways to raise the national profile of the event. DAW had been perceived by the media and 
others as a series of strictly local activities featuring a confusing array of themes and slogans.  A 
national working group was formed and a long-term strategic plan developed which continues 
to guide the group in its coordinating role. The group meets four times a year by 
teleconference.<P>

CCSA's long-term strategy has been to promote awareness of the Centre from the inside out. 
In the first couple of years, we concentrated on being known by our peers and colleagues within 
the field, focusing on research, treatment, prevention, education and enforcement. We are now 
moving into a broader arena, targeting groups whose involvement in substance abuse issues may 
be tangential to their principal preoccupation. Politicians and business people are two groups at 
whom new efforts at awareness building are currently being aimed.<P>

This project involves scanning the media for coverage of issues with which CCSA has had 
active involvement. The objective is to link references to CCSA in the media with a running log 
of media contacts maintained by CCSA spokespeople and information providers (to track 
"cause and effect"). A third component of the tracking system is an inventory of CCSA policy 
background papers against which public statements can be checked to ensure consistency.  All 
of this information is maintained in one electronic file which uses special software (FolioViews) 
to link various areas and to facilitate movement from one to another.<P>

Substance abuse information is scattered.  The Clearinghouse relies on networks of individuals 
and organizations in Canada, and elsewhere, to identify existing resources, to share scarce 
resources, and to compile information about the nature, extent and consequences of substance 
abuse in Canada.  The Canadian Substance Abuse Information Network (CSAIN), a network 
of substance abuse libraries and resource centres across the country, is coordinated by the 
Clearinghouse.  The primary means of communications among the members of these networks 
is the Internet, using email, file transfer, and information dissemination via the World Wide

and product development to fill those gaps.  This includes the development of a national 
bibliographic database, a database of the Clearinghouse collection, information about the 
collections and policies of the CSAIN partners, the Directory of Substance Abuse 
Organizations, the Inventory of Treatment Services, and the Inventory of Prevention Programs.  
In addition, the Clearinghouse produces printed versions of databases where appropriate, and 
disseminates information electronically via World Wide Web.<P>

<H1>Health and Enforcement in Partnership:  
<BR>
How the police, justice community groups, 
and health and social agencies are working 
together to build healthier, safer 
neighbourhoods</H1>
<HR>
This report was prepared for the <B>HEP Steering Committee, </B>which includes 
representatives from the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, Canada's Drug Strategy 
Secretariat, Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, Department of Solicitor General 
(Secretariat and RCMP), Department of Justice and Health Canada (Alcohol and Other Drugs 
Programmes).<P>
It was made possible with financial assistance from Canada's Drug Strategy, Health Canada. 
The views expressed in this working paper are those of the authors and are not necessarily 
those of the HEP Steering Committee or associated organizations. <BR>
Research: Margaret Beare and Curtis Clarke <BR>
Interpretation/Writing: Chris Mercer, Adhawk Communications<P>
Collaboration between health/social agencies and the police/justice system is still a relatively 
new phenomenon. However, collaboration is an essential and exciting ingredient in the success 
of many alcohol and other drug projects.<P>
The Health and Enforcement in Partnership (HEP) steering committee commissioned this report 
to discover what collaborative projects exist across Canada, and what forms they take. The 
research found a wide range of projects, from outreach programs to detoxification centres.<P>
<H2>RECOMMENDATIONS: <BR>
HOW TO IMPROVE COLLABORATION</H2>
Collaboration across diverse fields, disciplines, or "turf", requires deliberate planning and 
negotiation.  Respondents judged the relationship between their agencies to be cooperative and 
positive, however they also offered suggestions for improvement:<P>
<H3>Problem-Solving/Harm Reduction</H3>
1. Commitment to committee policing and harm reduction is a prerequisite to successful 
collaborative projects.<P>
<H3>Training and Education</H3>
2. The public must be an informed partner in any alcohol or other drug abuse-related 
strategy.<P>
3. Police require extensive information about all health and enforcement issues related to abuse 
of alcohol and other drugs.<P>
4. Needle exchange staff should train other agencies about harm/risk reduction as well as 
exchange goals and clients.<P>
5. Crown attorneys, buyers, police and judges must know about local treatment facilities, as 
well as diversion and alternative programs to prevent referral to nonexistent or overburdened 
support/treatment agencies.<P>
6. Professionals in non-police fields should be trained about problem solving policing and how 
the committee can contribute to its success.<P>
<H3>Regular meetings for collaborative partners</H3>
7. Community groups overseeing collaborative projects should meet regularly to share 
information and solve problems, not just when there is a crisis.<P>
<H3>Network of projects</H3>
8. The more collaborative projects in a community,<B> </B>the stronger the problem-solving 
network.<P>
<H3>Relationship between needle exchanges and 
police</H3>
9. Police are required to continue to enforce the law, even in the vicinity of needle exchange 
programs.  This must be balanced with the impact on outreach programs such as needle 
exchanges.<P>
<H3>Reduce the transferring of police officers</H3>
10. Continuity of collaborative and community policing projects depends on continuity of 
personnel.  Staff transfers should be minimized and adequate overlap and training provided 
when they are unavoidable.<P>
11. Reward for a job well done should not necessarily precipitate removal from that job.<P>
<H2>Recommendations: design for collaborative 
projects</H2>
The various partners involved in collaborative projects must know what is expected of them. 
For some of the players, partnership may be a new undertaking. Rules concerning 
confidentiality, accountability, and just mutual expectations should be discussed, negotiated if 
necessary and finally written into a formal document with dear terms of reference.<P>
12. A wide cross-section of agencies, service providers and even service clients should be 
involved in preliminary discussions, planning and program development.<P>
13. Community resources and training needs will be identified among the partners.<P>
14. The problem and primary target group should be clearly identified.<P>
15. Options for action should be somewhat flexible but overall guidelines should be clear.<P>
16. Protocols and guidelines should be written down for reference.<P>
17. Training and sensitivity training is an essential part of collaborative efforts.<P>
18. Decision-making should be influenced by officers working at street level who are part of 
collaborative projects and understand the community.<P>
19. Police staff evaluation should be adapted to reflect community policing/problem solving 
requirements.<P>
<H2>Recommendations: Health and Enforcement 
in Partnership Steering Committee</H2>
<H3>Protocols and guidelines</H3>
20. The HEP steering committee should produce a manual to guide collaborative projects.<P>
21. The HEP steering committee should produce a manual to guide diversion projects.  <P>
<H3>Policy direction</H3>
22. The HEP steering should study discretionary decision-making in the broader justice 
system.<P>
<H3>Treatment facilities</H3>
23. The HEP steering committee should communicate to the federal departments of Justice and 
Solicitor General the limited ability of some communities to meet the demand for treatment 
facilities imposed by a justice system bent on diversion or alternatives.<P>
24. The HEP steering committee should facilitate discussion with key player of treatment 
options in the light of the recent adoption of Bill C-41.<P>
<H3>International collaboration models</H3>
25. HEP should monitor international models and maintain an inventory of project 
evaluations.<P>
<H3>New research</H3>
26. HEP should link this research with other research on routine police discretionary diversion 
activity, Aboriginal diversion projects and post-charge projects.<P>

The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse is Canada's substance abuse agency, while each province has its 
own provincial contact that deals with substance abuse issues.  CCSA and ARF are described in detail 
below, followed by a listing of provincial agencies and other key organizations.  Your provincial agency 
should be your first contact point to determine the level of services and the specific resources available for 
your province.<P>

<H2><A NAME = ccsa></A>Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse (CCSA)</H2>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse is an arms-length, national agency, established in 1988 by an Act 
of Parliament.  Funded by Canada's Drug Strategy and through revenue-generating efforts, the Centre 
promotes informed debate on substance abuse issues and encourages public participation in reducing the 
harm associated with drug abuse, disseminates information on the nature, extent and consequences of 
substance abuse and supports and assists organizations involved in substance abuse treatment, prevention

<H1>MEDICAL CURRICULA, POLICIES 
AND PROGRAMS</H1>
<H2>Curricula</H2>
A commitment to improve and standardize alcohol and drug education at Canadian medical schools was 
expressed at the 1989 national conference <I>Preventing Alcohol Problems: the Challenge for Medical 
Education</I>.  It was agreed by the attenders of that conference that medical education should ensure 
that Canadian physicians have the knowledge, attitudes and skills to deal with and prevent alcohol 
problems in practice as well as play a leadership role in prevention within families and communities.  A 
special supplement in <I>CMAJ</I>, volume 143 (10), 1990, covers this conference.<P>
Since the conference, a core curriculum covering both alcohol and drug abuse has been developed jointly 
by the Canadian Medical Society on Alcohol and Other Drugs, the Faculty of Medicine, University of 
Toronto, and the Addiction Research Foundation.  It is available through the publisher, the Canadian Centre 
on Substance Abuse (CCSA).<P>

<B>Synopsis:</B> This program provides step-by-step training in an effective method of assessment and 
management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.  The method, developed in the Clinical Institute of the 
Addiction Research Foundation, helps to ensure adequate and prompt treatment of the alcoholic patient and 
prevent serious complications of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.  The program includes 3 modules: (1) 
Introduction: The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is defined, causes and clinical manifestations are examined, 
and characteristics of withdrawal reactions are summarized. (2) Assessment: In order to determine the most 
effective treatment procedure, severity of withdrawal must be assessed.  This module demonstrates the 
actual process of assessment, using simulations of a patient in minor and major withdrawal. (3) Treatment: 
Recommendations based on information recorded on the CIWA-A form are made for the management of 
minor and major withdrawal reactions. A variety of treatment approaches, both with and without drug 
therapy, are demonstrated.<P>

<B>Distributor:</B> RK Media Consultants, 107 Berkley Rd. Cambridge, ON N1S 3G8 (519) 622-5285 <BR>
<B>Synopsis:</B> 'Codependent' is a term originally used to describe people who "enable" the substance 
abuse of a partner or family member, for example, by ignoring the problem.  The term has since been applied 
to people in relationships with compulsive gamblers, compulsive eaters and others.  In this video, the 
theories of leading writers in the codependency field (Melody Beattie, Claudia Black, John Bradshaw, Pia 
Mellody) are presented. In addition, actors mime some of the behaviours that lead to co-dependency, such 
as boundary violations, low self-esteem and poor communication.<BR>
Evaluation: Good. Co-dependency is a somewhat controversial concept, since, as the definition has 
expanded, a large proportion of the population could now, in theory, be labelled co-dependent. For those 
who want to know more about the subject, this video would be a good primer. The narrative contains a lot of 
jargon, however, and is therefore best suited for professionals. The video seems aimed more at women than 
men; the early vignettes, for example, use the pronoun "she" exclusively. <P>

<B>Synopsis:</B> This video presents arguments and models for community based treatment. Realizing 
that criminal justice is not the answer and that treatment is cheaper than jail, a number of U.S. programs are 
presented. At Turning Point, clients are given duties and responsibilities and learn social skills and values. 
In another experimental program a client self administers methadone at home in much the same way that a 
diabetic person uses insulin. In a client run house in San Diego members are learning that just being off 
drugs is not enough, as one says, "I had to relearn my life." A counsellor states that the community also has 
to learn that addiction is not just the concern of those in treatment, but is a social problem of concern to 
everyone.<P>

<B>Synopsis:</B> Leo, a recovering alcoholic, feels paralysed by depression.  Neither his wife nor his boss 
can find a way to lift his spirits.  Mary suffers from panic attacks and uses alcohol and tranquillizers to quell 
her symptoms, while her worried family tries to cope.  The video dramatizes their symptoms and follows both 
through diagnosis and treatment. Leo is prescribed anti-depressants (which don't violate his sobriety, his 
psychiatrist says), and psychotherapy helps him resolve long standing feelings of grief and anger towards 
his father.  Following detoxification, Mary follows a comprehensive program of therapy, relaxation, and other 
coping skills. The subject of dual disorders is emerging as a key issue in the health field.  <BR>
Evaluation: Good. The subject of dual disorders is emerging as a key issue in the health field. Professionals 
in the mental health field need to know more about drug use and its effects, and addictions professionals 
must learn more about some of the mood and personality disorders that may co-exist with - or even prompt - 
alcohol or drug abuse. This video covers some of the basics, but seems geared more to the mental health 
professional than the addictions specialist. Viewers may find the attitudes of Mary's husband and therapist 
rather paternalistic.<P>

<B>Synopsis:</B> This two part program follows an open-ended counselling group through a 4 month 
period. It depicts a group of drug and alcohol dependent individuals (a pressman, a nurse, a school teacher, 
a manager, an unemployed man, a school drop-out). They learn to deal with their pain, conflicts, 
disappointments and their growth as individuals and as a group. They struggle with relapse, sexuality, 
inadequacy, loneliness, peer pressure, abstinence and their relationship with the group leader.<P>

<B>Producer:</B> Drug Policy Foundation, 4801 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., #400  Washington D.C. USA 
20016, (202) 895-1634<BR>
<B>Distributor:</B> Same<BR>
<B>Synopsis:</B> Strict laws against the use of narcotic drugs may help stem drug abuse. But they may 
also impede physicians who wish to prescribe such drugs for patients in chronic pain. Physicians who 
`overprescribe' narcotic drugs risk investigation or suspension, but there are no real operating definitions of 
`overprescription'- just `community standards'. Multidisciplinary pain  clinics may offer alternatives to 
narcotic pain killers, but not every patient can afford such care. This video examines the case of Dr. Harvey 
Rose, a California physician, who spent five years (and $140,000) fighting charges of overprescribing; then it 
features Dr. Rose in a debate with a law professor and two doctors who are also members of state regulatory 
boards.<BR>
Evaluation: Good. The participants present an informed discussion of an important topic. Among the issues 
debated are: whether patients should have to endure a life of chronic pain simply to prevent the possibility 
of dependence. There is also a discussion of the terms addiction and dependence and the difference 
between them.<P>

<B>Synopsis:</B> This program outlines how medical emergency staff in a hospital might respond when 
presented with an intoxicated patient. In the example shown here a man, found collapsed, is brought into the 
hospital emergency room where staff attempt to treat and assess his injuries and condition. Ways are 
outlined to deal with a confused client while protecting the safety of the staff.<P>

<B>Distributor:</B> Same<BR>
<B>Synopsis:</B> Program 1 explains motivation as an interactional process which is influenced by the 
characteristics of the client and the therapist, as well as by environmental factors. It covers the stages 
people go through as they change and the primary therapeutic strategies that help them move from one 
stage to the next. Program 2 demonstrates some methods that the helping professional can use in dealing 
effectively with resistance represented by the substance abuser.  Resistance is defined as any client or 
counsellor behaviour that blocks the attainment of therapeutic goals.  It is viewed as a natural part of the 
change process since the prospect of change typically elicits anxiety and fear.  This program also 
demonstrates the major components of the therapeutic process applicable to clients with addiction 
problems.  Through the use of counselling skills, the interviewer assists the client in moving from stage to 
stage.<P>

<B>Audience:</B> health professionals<BR>
<B>Producer:</B> Project Coordinator, CASAA Research Division, Dept.of Psychology, University of 
New Mexico, Alluquerque, NM 87131-1161 USA<BR>
<B>Synopsis:</B> William Miller discusses and illustrates the practice of "gentle confrontation" through 
empathy and reflection to elicit the client's cooperation in the assembly of a program to suit their particular 
needs.  This video is in two sections.  Part One (26 min.) demonstrates an initial interview with a client, Peter, 
at risk for health and family problems resulting from excess drinking.  Part Two (37 min.) represents a third 
session with the same client after a thorough assessment, where results of tests are reviewed, and the client 
"contracts" to modify behaviour.<BR>
Evaluation: Good. A realistic portrayal of the sometimes tedious, but often rewarding, process of motivating 
a person to address a substance abuse problem. The film would make a good training tool for addictions 
counsellors. Unfortunately, a bland production makes the counselling process seem even more tedious than 
it really is. As well, the film could have benefited from showing a broader range of clients, including those 
with less severe problems.<P>

<B>Synopsis:</B> Prepared by the Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission, this kit provides 
counsellors with a strategy for helping clients maintain abstinence.  It uses education and skill development 
to prepare clients to: handle high-risk situations, reduce stress and develop a balanced lifestyle. The 
contents of this kit should be incorporated into the treatment process currently being used. Included in the 
kit is information for counsellor reference and training, a pamphlet, over-head material, and client

<B>Producer:</B> Gerald T. Rogers, 5215 Old Orchard Rd., Suite 990, Skokir, IL 60077<BR>
<B>Synopsis:</B> Designed for the use of professional counsellors dealing with clients who have relapsed. 
The what and why of relapse is explored:  interview demonstrations show how to help the client reduce the 
likelihood of relapse, identify warning signs, anticipate risk factors, achieve lifestyle balance, and to 
interrupt relapse when it occurs.  Clients are encouraged to take action, change attitudes, develop structure, 
set goals, and participate in normal activities. Throughout the video, main points are highlighted, and the 
relapse process is reviewed at the conclusion.<P>

<B>Distributor:</B> Kinetic Inc. 408 Dundas St. E. Toronto, ON M5A 2A5 (416) 963-5979<BR>
<B>Synopsis:</B> Dry mouth, sweating palms, pounding heart: these symptoms are typical of the body's 
"fight or flight" response to anticipated physical or mental distress. This video suggests controlling such 
stress is crucial to maintaining good health. A variety of stress reduction techniques are outlined, 
biofeedback, meditation, conscious breathing, point-by-point relaxation and exercise. Also emphasized are 
the importance of maintaining a positive mental attitude by "living in the present." Included is a scale that 
viewers can use to rate their stress levels.<BR>
Evaluation: Very Good. A comprehensive overview of stress reduction techniques, with practical advice on 
how to use them. Although the film does not make a direct connection between stress and drug and alcohol 
use, it would be appropriate for use in addictions treatment programs that use stress reduction techniques. 
It could also be appropriate as a prevention tool in schools and workplaces.<P>

<B>Distributor:</B> Same<BR>
<B>Synopsis:</B> The response to drug use has generally been in two areas: primary drug education and 
prevention programmes, and tertiary treatment programmes for those seriously involved with drugs. A third 
avenue of response, secondary prevention, has been largely neglected.  This kit proposes to fill this gap by 
providing an in-depth course of professional development in secondary prevention.  It will enable users of 
this kit to respond more effectively to young people who are developing problems in which drugs or alcohol 
play a part.  The kit consists of a learner's manual in five units; 6 cases studies (on VHS); and a background 
book of reading.  Prepared by Health and Welfare Canada and the ARF.<P>

Since the "formal" identification of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in 1973, interest in 
developing and studying animal models of FAS has swelled, giving rise to a thriving area of 
research. The development of animal models has provided an invaluable research tool for 
characterizing and advancing the study of alcohol's adverse effects on the developing fetus. 
By employing several species (including nonhuman primates) and a variety of 
methodologies and experimental approaches, animal research has played a major role in 
advancing knowledge of the many immediate and long-term deleterious consequences that 
follow prenatal alcohol exposure.<P>
Animal research, performed under controlled laboratory conditions, substantiates 
hypotheses formed by observing humans with FAS; in other cases, it helps form new 
hypotheses. Using animal models, researchers have discovered detailed brain abnormalities 
related to FAS, identified critical periods and critical doses of alcohol exposure, and 
identified alcohol-induced biochemical changes in the pregnant animal or her fetuses. The 
issues are beyond the bounds of clinical FAS research with humans either for ethical 
reasons or because researchers are unable to exercise the type of control over the genetic 
background and environment that is needed for a truly accurate experiment.<P>
After discussing in more detail the benefits of FAS animal models and some related general 
findings, this article will highlight some of the specific observations made by basic animal 
research in the last 20 years.<P>
<H4>Animal research<BR>
Benefits of Animal Models</H4>
Animal studies allow researchers a degree of control impossible with research on humans. 
Researchers can control the genetic background of the parent animals as well as certain 
environmental factors. Rigorous control may be exerted over variables such as amount of 
alcohol (i.e., alcohol "dose"), pattern of alcohol consumption. duration and timing of 
alcohol exposure during pregnancy, and maternal nutritional status. For example, to 
identify a threshold dose of alcohol above which fetal damage occurs, alcohol can be 
administered on particular days or weeks of pregnancy, or the amount of alcohol given can 
be varied from animal to animal. Further, using animals with different genetic backgrounds 
may provide insight into the possible contribution of genetic factors that may govern 
susceptibility to alcohol-related damage.<P>
One of the first issues tackled by animal researchers was whether alcohol, itself, was 
responsible for the constellation of birth defects labeled FAS. Alcoholic women frequently 
abuse tobacco, have poor health, and are malnourished. Any of these factors could result in 
birth defects, and skeptics questioned the focus on alcohol ingestion alone in the coining of 
the term "fetal alcohol syndrome." Thus, animal models were used to determine if alcohol 
alone was a teratogen -- a substance capable of causing birth defects.<P>
Almost simultaneously, two different laboratories reported that alcohol administration to 
pregnant mice resulted in smaller offspring and birth defects similar to those reported in 
humans with FAS (Chernoff 1977; Randall et al. 1977). These studies controlled for 
polydrug use, maternal health, and nutritional factors, indicating that alcohol, per se, is 
teratogenic to humans and mice.<P>
Since the publication of the studies in mice, the teratogenic effects of alcohol have been 
demonstrated in many other species, including nonhuman primates (National Institute on 
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA] 1990, 1993). However, the majority of the 
research generated with animals has used either mice or rats. Mice have been used 
primarily to examine alcohol-induced birth defects (structural malformations), whereas rats 
have been primarily for studying alcohol-induced behavioural deficits. Indeed, the 
structural and functional defects observed in these rodent models of FAS are remarkably 
similar to those identified in human clinical studies (Driscoll et al. 1990).<P>
Determining alcohol's threshold dose and mechanism of action is more complicated than 
demonstrating that alcohol is a teratogen. It is highly unlikely that researchers will identify a 
single threshold dose or safe limit of prenatal alcohol exposure; a unique, circumscribed, 
and sensitive period of development; or one mechanism of action for the various effects of 
prenatal alcohol exposure in humans.<P>
To make the task even more complicated, it is likely that different aspects of development 
may be sensitive to different levels of alcohol. Despite the complexity of the issues, 
scientists have made inroads into understanding this formidable disorder. Since the 
identification of FAS two decades ago, animal research has produced a wealth of general 
information regarding the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the fetus. Some of these 
findings are summarized below.<P>
<H4>General Findings</H4>
<U>Critical Periods<I></U> </I>By varying when during pregnancy females are given 
alcohol, animal research has demonstrated that the specific type of birth defect produced 
depends on the system(s) in the fetus undergoing development at the time of alcohol 
exposure (Becker 1992; Randall 1987; Webster 1989). Organ systems are most vulnerable 
to damage by alcohol during the period of most dynamic development. For example, heavy 
alcohol exposure during the period of craniofacial development (which roughly 
corresponds to the third and fourth weeks of human pregnancy) will affect the structure of 
the facial features but not the structure of the kidney, an organ system that develops around 
the sixth week of human pregnancy (Webster 1989). This type of exposure and damage 
can be considered a "binge" - type model.<P>
As would be expected, heavy alcohol consumption throughout pregnancy, as opposed to 
occasional binges, risks the entire constellation of structural defects involving several major 
organ systems and including growth retardation and brain abnormalities (NIAAA 1990, 
1993). This pattern is more consistent with what is known as FAS.<P>
The complexity of alcohol-related damage is perhaps best illustrated when considering the 
brain and its sensitivity to alcohol during development. Unlike other organs, the brain is 
one of the first organ systems to begin to develop and the last to be completed. Thus, the 
brain appears to be sensitive to the adverse effects of alcohol throughout its development 
and over all trimesters of pregnancy. Animal research has revealed that some brain regions 
are more sensitive to the teratogenic actions of alcohol and, further, that some cell 
populations are more vulnerable to alcohol insult than others even within particular brain 
region (West 1986).<P>
Thus, critical periods of vulnerability to the harmful effects of alcohol on brain 
development appear to vary among various regions of the brain. This pattern of damage 
may explain the wide array and complex pattern of behavioural and neurological 
abnormalities that have been observed in human and laboratory animal offspring exposed 
to alcohol at different times during fetal development.<P>
<U>Critical Doses</U> Animal models have shown that peak blood alcohol level rather 
than total amount of alcohol consumed may represent the "critical dose" or threshold of 
alcohol above which an adverse effect will be seen (West et al. 1990). This finding implies 
that drinking <I>pattern</I> is critical. Rapid consumption of alcohol in a short period of 
time will result in a higher blood alcohol level than sipping the same amount of alcohol 
slowly over a long period of time. These results underscore the importance, when studying 
humans, of researchers asking women about their pattern of drinking in addition to the total 
number of drinks as the former may have a greater negative impact on pregnancy 
outcome.<P>
<H4>Comparing Symptoms of FAS in Animal Models and 
Humans</H4>
The symptoms found in animal models are remarkably similar to those observed in humans 
(Driscoll et al. 1990). This similarity applies to physical defects and behavioural effects. In 
addition, the deleterious effects of in utero alcohol exposure in animal models, as in 
humans, have been shown to exist along a continuum. Both the full-blow syndrome (FAS) 
and the partial expression of the syndrome, which has been termed "fetal alcohol effects" 
(FAE), have been seen in alcohol-exposed animals. With adequate animal models, 
researchers can begin to identify problems not yet identified in humans and the 
mechanisms of alcohol's effect.<P>
<U>Birth Weight and Growth Patterns<I></U> </I>Retarded growth in utero and after 
birth is a hallmark of FAS and has been reported in a wide variety of species prenatally 
exposed to alcohol (NIAAA 1990, 1993). In many cases, body weight and body length 
deficits and small heads (microcephaly) were dose related and observed after various 
exposure patterns, although exposure to alcohol during the equivalent of the second and 
third trimesters appeared to be most critical for this pregnancy outcome (Becker 1992; 
Randall 1987; West 1986). In some instances, there was evidence of "catch-up" in growth 
as the animals matured; in others, the growth retardation extended into adulthood (Becker 
1992). Some recent reports in mice have indicated that the deficits in growth may not be 
apparent until adolescence and early adulthood (Becker 1992).<P>
Animal models allow the use of cross-fostering techniques to minimize the possibility that 
deficient growth patterns are caused merely by postnatal factors, such as poor maternal 
behaviour, rather than in utero alcohol exposure, per se. With cross-fostering, alcohol-
exposed offspring are raised by control mothers, and control offspring are raised by 
alcohol-exposed mothers. Data from animal studies indicate that both reduced birth weight 
and postnatal growth retardation can be attributed primarily to prenatal alcohol 
exposure.<P>
<H4>Major Organ Systems</H4><I>
</I>As in humans, animal models have demonstrated a wide variety of organ anomalies 
after acute and chronic exposure to alcohol (Becker 1992; Randall 1987). The organs are 
most sensitive to damage by alcohol exposure during organogenesis, a period when they 
are first developing. In rodents, the period of organogenesis includes the second week of a 
20 to 21 day gestation period (Becker 1992; Webster 1989). This roughly corresponds to 
weeks 2 to 8 in human pregnancy.<P>
As mentioned earlier, the time of alcohol exposure within this period determines which 
developing organ system(s) will be affected. Animal studies have modeled these 
possibilities through careful control of the timing of alcohol exposure during 
embryonic/fetal development (Becker 1992; Webster 1989).<P>
<U>Craniofacial Defects</U> The presence of characteristic defects of the face and head 
is important for the diagnosis of FAS in humans. Animals exposed to alcohol during early 
organogenesis are born with a pattern of craniofacial defects that are remarkably similar to 
the facial features of children with FAS. (Sulik et al. 1981; NIAAA 1990, l993). Further 
examination of these animal fetuses revealed other brain malformations, suggesting that the 
craniofacial defects may indicate brain abnormalities (Kotch and Sulik 1992). Indeed. a 
positive relationship has been noted between the severity of craniofacial defects and mental 
disability in children with FAS (Streissguth et al. 1991; NIAAA 1990, 1993).<P>
<U>Skeletal Anomalies</U> Exposure to alcohol during organogenesis results in skeletal 
malformations in laboratory mice, especially limb defects (Becker 1992). Limb 
malformations primarily have involved the forelimbs, with incomplete growth of one or 
both forelimbs and various types of defects of the digits on the limbs. The digit defects 
have been attributed to cell death of the limb buds following alcohol exposure. Other 
skeletal anomalies reported include those of the vertebrae, sternum, and ribs (Becker 
1992). The pattern of skeletal defects observed in mice is similar to that observed clinically 
in humans.<P>
<U>Cardiovascular Anomalies</U> Animals exposed to alcohol at a time that roughly 
corresponds to as early as weeks 3 to 4 of human pregnancy have had cardiovascular 
malformations that are similar to those reported in children with FAS (Becker 1992; 
Webster 1989). Most notably, they include malformations of the heart itself and of the 
vessels leading to and from the heart.<P>
<U>Urogenital Anomalies</U> In both experimental animals and humans, the developing 
kidney has been shown to be sensitive to alcohol-induced damage (NIAAA 1990, 1993). 
Kidney defects were observed in children with FAS only after they were first identified in 
animals. Renal malformations typically have included structural defects of the kidney and 
the ureter, which carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. Abnormal sexual 
development and function also have been documented in animals prenatally exposed to 
alcohol. Many of these effects may be attributed to alcohol induced alteration of sex 
hormones both at the level of the brain and in the sex organs (discussed below).<P>
<H4>Sensory and Motor Effects</H4>
A variety of sensory and motor deficits have been identified in children with FAS and 
modeled in studies with experimental animals. These include visual, auditory, balance, and 
motor coordination problems.<P>
<U>Visual Deficits</U> Defects involving the eyes and the visual process are common in 
children with FAS and typically result in impaired visual acuity and nearsightedness. The 
most common defects are small eyes, drooping eyelids (ptosis), short eye openings, crossed 
eyes, a reduction in the number of optic nerve axons, and abnormal vasculature in the 
retina. A similar pattern of eye anomalies has been found in animal models (NIAAA 1990, 
1993). Investigations of the underlying cause of these defects have shown that embryonic 
alcohol exposure results in an increased rate of cell death and impaired cell replication in 
the retina as well as reduced myelination (insulation) of the nerve that connects the eye to 
the brain. The developing eve appears to be sensitive to alcohol induced damage.<P>
<U>Auditory Deficits</U> Children with FAS show a high prevalence of hearing 
impairment related to structural damage of the ear during its development. Research with 
animals has demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure can have deleterious effects at 
various levels of the auditory system. For example, rats prenatally exposed to alcohol have 
been found to have hearing loss resulting from both abnormal electrical activity in the 
brain-stem and disruptions in auditory processing at the level of the cortex (NIAAA 1990, 
1993) .<P>
<U>Balance and Motor Effects</U> Children with FAS have a wide range of balance and 
motor coordination deficiencies, some of which persist well into childhood (documented 
through 12 years of age). They include problems with balance and gait, muscle tremors, 
and deficits in both gross and fine motor function. Rats prenatally exposed to alcohol have 
shown delayed development of motor reflexes, deficits in performance of tasks that require 
motor coordination, and alterations in walking pattern (NIAAA 1990, 1993). Many of 
these motor problems suggest damage to the cerebellum, a pan of the brain that plays an 
important role in controlling motor coordination. Rat studies have confirmed this 
speculation, as have autopsies of humans with FAS (West 1986).<P>
<H4>Effects on behaviour<BR>
Neonatal and Regulatory Effects</H4>
<U>Fetal Movement</U> The deleterious effects of alcohol exposure have been well 
characterized in offspring after birth, but relatively little is known about the behaviour of 
the alcohol-exposed fetus in utero. Recent procedures involving direct observation of rat 
fetal activity in utero showed a substantial reduction in overall activity and movements 
compared with non-alcohol-exposed fetuses (NIAAA 1990, 1993). Such alcohol-induced 
suppression of prenatal activity also has been shown regarding breathing movements and 
brain activity in near-term fetal sheep and in the fetuses of pregnant women who consumed 
alcohol (NIAAA 1990, 1993).<P>
Altered fetal activity and reduced fetal movement have been associated with profound 
effects on morphological development in humans and animals, therefore, alcohol-induced 
suppression of movement in the developing fetus may be a contributing factor in FAS.<P>
<U>Feeding Behaviour</U> Human newborns prenatally exposed to alcohol are not good 
feeders. They are easily distracted and fatigued when suckling, and, even when they do 
feed, they have a weak, irregular suckling response. Similar feeding abnormalities have 
been found and systematically studied in rodents prenatally, exposed to alcohol (Driscoll et 
al. 1990). Rat studies suggest that newborn rats that do not nurse successfully may have 
impaired ability to detect smell cues, thereby hindering the pups' ability to locate the 
mother's nipples; difficulty in coordinating motor behaviours; or a dampened level of 
arousal to stimuli related to attaching to the nipple.<P>
These findings suggest that altered feeding behaviour may be related to the growth deficits 
observed postnatally. If so, basic research efforts can identify ways to improve feeding 
behaviour that may have clinical application.<P>
<U>Long Term Behavioural Effects</U>  FAS was diagnosed initially in young children, 
and although abnormal behaviours were observed at birth and during the neonatal period, it 
was not possible to predict if behavioural problems would get better as the children got 
older, if they would stay the same, if different types of abnormal behaviours would be 
observed with maturation, or if the children could be taught to utilize strategies that 
compensate for their behaviour. Given that animals mature significantly faster than humans 
do, the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol could be more easily examined in 
animal models.<P>
Now that study populations of humans with FAS are growing older, researchers are finding 
that abnormal behaviours do persist. The animal models can be used to evaluate the 
effectiveness of interventions, particularly drug therapies, that try to alleviate abnormal 
behaviours.<P>
In animals, many of the behavioural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure have been shown 
to diminish with age (NIAAA 1990, 1993). It has been proposed that rather than 
irreparably altering behaviour, alcohol merely retards brain development, with eventual 
catch-up on compensatory behaviours producing more normal development. Recent data, 
however, have shown the reemergence of some deficits in older animals, suggesting either 
that the compensatory systems break down with age or that more complex or difficult tasks 
unmask persistent defects (West et al. 1990; NIAAA 1990, 1993). In particular, these 
deficits include impaired performance in learning and memory tasks.<P>
These findings complement those of clinical studies that have revealed persistent 
attentional, cognitive, and neurobehavioural deficits in children of alcohol-abusing mothers, 
primarily when the testing conditions were challenging to the children. (Streissguth et al. 
1991).<P>
Animal models should prove useful in identifying the types of behavioural deficits that are 
permanent and those that are transient developmental delays.  Even more important, 
however, is the use of animal models to develop effective interventions to improve 
cognitive learning and memory, whether the interventions be pharmacological or behavioral 
in nature.  Such information is critical in identifying special education approaches for 
children exposed to alcohol prenatally so that they can more fully benefit from school.<P>
<U>Effects on the Central Nervous System </U>Behavioural problems observed in off-
spring exposed prenatally to alcohol, such as hyperactivity and perseveration (repetition of 
a mental activity with an inability to switch to another activity), poor balance and 
coordination, difficulty walking, and the inability to concentrate or to learn from past 
experiences, are all indicative of abnormal development of the brain, or central nervous 
system (CNS). Those CNS defects include abnormal structure and connections of brain 
cells and irregular communication from cell to cell.<P>
Animal models have demonstrated relationships between abnormal behaviours and specific 
structural defects in the brain. For example, learning and memory deficits have been 
demonstrated in animals that exhibited, on post mortem examination, alcohol-induced 
damaged in the hippocampus, a part of the brain that plays an important role in mediating 
these mental activities (NIAAA 1990,1993). Also, motorcoordination problems have been 
linked to structural deficits in the cerebellum.<P>
Such structure-function associations observed in animal models may serve to guide similar 
studies in human FAS/FAE populations where more sophisticated neuropsychological tests 
may be combined with powerful brain-imaging techniques, such as nuclear magnetic 
resonance, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emissions tomography scanning.<P>
The discovery of altered brain chemistry in prenatally alcohol-exposed offspring also may 
help to explain altered behaviour. Chemical in the brain -- neurochemicals -- control brain 
function and behaviour.<P>
Neurochemical systems are involved in the expression of different types of behaviours, 
including feeding behaviour, sleep, and even mental health problems such as depression 
and anxiety. Animal studies have found that several neurochemical systems are altered in 
animals exposed prenatally to alcohol (NIAAA 1990, 1993). The identification of specific 
neurochemical imbalances in animal models and of drugs that alleviate these imbalances 
may lead to appropriate pharmacological interventions for humans with similar behavioural 
problems.<P>
<U>Effects of Neuroendocrine Systems</U>  Levels of the sex hormones testosterone and 
estradiol are controlled by a complex feedback system that is critical to maintaining the 
proper balance of these hormones. The hypothalamus (the part of the brain that converts 
incoming electrical information from neurons into chemical. bloodborne messengers called 
hormones) sends hormonal messages to the pituitary (the body's master endocrine gland). 
The pituitary then releases other hormones that act on specific parts of the body, such as 
the testes (in men) or the ovaries (in women) These target tissues release yet more 
hormonestestosterone and estradiol, for examplethat on reaching standard levels in the 
blood, trigger the hypothatamus and pituitary gland to stop releasing hormonal 
messengers.<P>
Disruption of any part of this loop (hypothalamus pituitary target tissues 
hypothatamus/pituitary) can have detrimental effects. Rat models have shown that prenatal 
alcohol exposure alters the feedback system in both males and females by altering activity 
in the critical brain structures and the sex organs (NIAAA 1990, 1993) As a result, sexual 
maturation is delayed, sexual behaviour is disrupted, hormone levels are abnormal, and 
reproductive function is altered.<P>
Abnormal hormonal levels during the critical period of sexual differentiation of the brain 
may be expected to produce long-term effects. In the rat, this critical period corresponds to 
the end of gestation and extends into the first week of postnatal life (this is equivalent to the 
third trimester of pregnancy in humans). During this time, the production and secretion of 
testosterone are the primary hormonal influences that promote the masculinization of the 
brain in male rat offspring. Prenatal alcohol exposure blunts the normal testosterone surge 
in male neonates (NIAAA 1990, 1993), resulting in demasculinization, or feminization, of 
certain brain structures and behaviours in adult male offspring. l<P>
This finding might have implications for sexual maturation in humans with FAS 
(Streissguth et al 1991). It will be interesting to see if abnormal sex hormone regulation and 
reproductive function observed in animal models predict similar problems in humans 
exposed to alcohol prenatally. Given that FAS was not identified until 20 years ago, such 
observations should only now be seen as the newborns who were given a diagnosis of FAS 
in the early 1970s reach sexual maturation and enter their reproductive years.<P>
Another neuroendocrine anomaly observed in animal models is the biochemical response to 
stress in rats exposed to alcohol in utero. The reaction to stress is controlled by a feedback 
loop similar to that of the sex hormones, involving the hypothatamus, the pituitary gland, 
and the adrenal glands as the target tissue (as opposed to the testes or ovaries). Research 
findings have indicated a heightened response to stress in offspring exposed to alcohol 
prenatally (NIAAA 1990, 1993).<P>
Animal models are being used to identify the exact location of the defect in the feedback 
loop. An aberrant response to stress as a function of exposure to alcohol prenatally has 
direct clinical implications, especially because alcohol is sometimes consumed to relieve 
stress. Additionally, maladaptive responses to stress would be expected to interfere 
negatively with daily functioning.<P>
<H4>Effects on the immune system</H4>
Animals exposed prenatally to alcohol have demonstrated alcohol-induced deficiencies in 
the immune response that might explain the increased risk for infections observed in 
children with FAS. In particular, the animals showed a reduction in the number of cells that 
fight infection., the T-lymphocytes, which in turn increases susceptibility to infection and, 
possibly, cancer. Although this area of research has not been studied as extensively as some 
of the others discussed above, it promises to provide important clinical information related 
to identification and intervention so that the severity and number of infections can be 
reduced.<P>
<H4>Studies on mechanisms of fetal alcohol damage</H4>
Identifying the mechanism(s) of action by which alcohol affects fetal growth and 
development is one of the most important roles that animal research can play. Given the 
multitude of different types of defects, the involvement of all major organ systems, and the 
involvement of many dysfunctional neurochemical and biochemical processes, the search 
for the underlying mechanism(s) will not be easy. It may be that several different 
mechanisms are responsible for the myriad of deleterious effects that follow prenatal 
alcohol exposure.<P>
Alcohol could affect fetal development in several ways: directly, by damaging and killing 
the developing fetal cells; indirectly, by affecting placental function in the mother; or by 
affecting any one of the numerous biochemical steps involved in the process of fetal 
development.<P>
Animal research has found that alcohol readily crosses the placenta and can directly alter 
fetal development by attacking the developing cells, thereby decreasing cell size and cell 
number in several organ systems (NIAAA 1990. 1993). These studies do not however rule 
out other mechanisms. Indeed, research has shown that alcohol-induced damage probably 
results from both direct and indirect effects of the drug on the developing fetus. Animal 
research in pregnant rats has shown rather consistently that alcohol can decrease the 
transport of essential nutritional elements called amino acids across the placenta to the fetus 
(NIAAA 1990, 1993; Schenker et al. 1990); similarly, glucose transport has been shown to 
be reduced. A reduction in transport of either of these building blocks could explain 
decreased fetal weight and other types of abnormal development.<P>
It has been suggested that alcohol-induced structural defects may be a result of an alteration 
in a class of compounds called prostaglandins that are important for normal fetal growth 
and development as well as control of umbilical blood flow. 2  An imbalance of 
prostaglandin levels, in turn, may adversely affect development in two ways: by altering 
cellular differentiation of the developing fetus and by reducing blood flow to and from the 
placenta. Decreased blood flow would be expected to result in a lowered supply of amino 
acids and oxygen to the fetus. Both decreased oxygen and decreased nutrient supply would 
have a negative effect on growth and development.<P>
Technological advances now available to the researcher will permit direct quantification of 
placental and umbilical blood flow and oxygen consumption. If, for example, blood flow is 
found to be reduced in alcohol-consuming pregnant animals, scientists can begin to address 
the biochemical reason for the decreased flow, such as an imbalance of certain 
prostaglandins.<P>
Scientists also are using animal models to examine the effects of alcohol on chemical 
growth factors, which play a critical role in the regulation of cell growth and survival, and 
on other biological mechanisms that may be involved in programmed death of brain cells 
(West et al. 1990). Fetal development is a complex process that itself is not yet fully 
understood. Cell signaling systems that appear to control various aspects of fetal 
development, such as certain neurotransmilters (e.g. N-methyl-D-asparate [NMDA] and 
sero-tonin), retinoic acid and cyclic AMP, may have a significant role in FAS, as may the 
expression of developmental genes. The cell signaling systems and the expression of 
developmental genes both appear to be affected by alcohol (Pullarkat and Azar 1991; 
Hogan 1991).<P>
<H4>Conclusion</H4>
Many more potential mechanisms of action remain. This area of investigation into the basis 
for the teratogenic actions of alcohol is still in its infancy stage. The future looks bright for 
animal research to make major advances not only in the identification of potential 
mechanism(s) but also in the evaluation of various types of interventions. As for other 
medical conditions, the development of appropriate treatment strategies for FAS can only 
be realized and successfully implemented when the mechanisms underlying the myriad 
defects related to fetal alcohol exposure are uncovered.<P>
1 The effects observed in females are more variable and less clear.<P>
2 This is a hypothesized mechanism that is supported by several research findings (see 
NIAAA 1990, 1993). It may not be simply due to a static increase or decrease in 
prostaglandin levels but rather to a change in the balance of these compounds.<P>

<H3><A NAME = fas></A>FAS/E Support 
Network</H3>
The purpose of the FAS/E Support Network is to encourage the provision of information, 
support and services for families, professionals and the broader community around 
prevention, intervention and treatment issues relating to alcohol related birth defects, 
including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Effect and other disabilities caused by drug use during 
pregnancy.<P>
Its mandate is to specifically aid in. and advocate for, the development of home. school, 
and community based services which will better meet the needs of affected individuals. 
their families and professionals working with them.<P>
In working towards these objectives. the Network recognizes the strengths inherent in birth 
foster and adoptive families, and their commitment to these children and adults. Facilitation 
of parent support is strongly encouraged; the opportunity for parents to talk, on a regular 
basis, to other parents who are also caring for children and adults with FAS/E is invaluable. 
Often it is only other parents, who are also coping with the complexities of parenting these 
multifaceted people, who can understand and empathize with the problems being faced. 
Parents can often learn different methods for working more successfully with an affected 
individual by brainstorming with other parents who have "been there" before. At the very 
least, they will find understanding, acceptance and support.<P>
A telephone "warm line" exists to facilitate this process, and to provide both parents and 
the professional community with current and specific information. It provides a 
knowledgeable "on call" person who can be reached at any time. These services are 
currently provided at no cost to the recipient.<P>
As part of its advocacy work, the Support Network seeks to act as a voice with 
Government, both locally, provincially and federally. Members sit on various committees 
whose mandates are as diverse as specialized educational programming and criminal justice 
issues. If you have concerns you would like to make committee members aware of, please 
leave a message on the "warm line".<P>
The Network is also active in the research, design and development of resource materials 
for FAS/E and the provision of a broad range of training programs.<P>

<H3><A NAME = coalition></A>Coalition Presses for 
Warning Labels on Alcohol Containers</H3>
The Coalition for Warning Labels on Alcohol Containers believes that the public has a 
right to know about the potential hazards of alcohol consumption. Virtually all foods, drugs 
and household products that present possible risks carry printed information alerting the 
consumer of the hazard. Alcohol, a product involved in a disproportionate percent of 
health problems, is an exception to this widespread practice. The Coalition is urging 
government legislation to require warning labels to ensure consistency for consumers. 
Labels would warn of alcohol's dangers to the fetus and other hazards.<P>
The Coalition cites five reasons why containers should bear warnings:<P>
<UL>
<LI>alcohol is a drug and may be addictive 
<LI>there is known risk to the fetus when a pregnant woman drinks alcohol
<LI>many seniors on regular medication are vulnerable to side effects caused by alcohol 
interacting wit other drugs
<LI>drinking may lead to health problems and chronic illness.
</UL>
Labeling is not new to the liquor industry. Since 1989, all Canadian beer, wine and spirits 
exported to the USA have been required by US law to bear warning labels. The Coalition 
wants the brewers, vintners and distillers to give their Canadian customers protection 
equivalent to that which they are presently giving to American customers.<P>
Headed by Alcohol-Drug Education Service, the Coalition met with the BC Minister of 
Health, Paul Ramsey; the Minister of Social Services, Joy MacPhail; and the Attorney 
General, Colin Gableman February 24th to discuss these issues. Health groups who 
support the Coalition include the BC FAS Resource Society, BC Epilepsy Society, BC 
Home Economics Association, BC Medical Association, Community Action for Substance 
Abuse, Elizabeth Fry Society, Healthiest Babies Possible - Surrey, Kaiser Youth 
Foundation, Mothers Against Drinking Drivers, Seniors Well Aware Program and YWCA

Interest has grown over the past few years around issues relating to the difficulties that 
adolescents and young adults with FAS/FAE have in their encounters with the criminal 
justice system.<P>
A roundtable discussion on this topic was organized for the Train the Trainers conference 
which was held in Vancouver in March 1994. Shortly after that, a panel presentation on 
this topic was presented at the FAS/NAS conference in Vancouver in June 1994. Sitting 
on that panel were The Honourable Justice David Vickers, the Deputy Ombudsman Brent 
Parfitt and Dr. Juli Conry. There was considerable discussion following that panel and 
members who attended agreed that it might be beneficial to have continuing and regular 
contact to discuss issues relating to young people with FAS in the criminal justice system. It 
was agreed that the B.C. FAS Resource Society should form a Justice Committee.<P>
Representatives on this committee should include those people working in the system who 
have an interest in this area as well as parents. The committee met several times over the 
fall of 1994 under the chairmanship of Dana Brynelsen.<P>
Draft goals established by the committee include the following:<P>
<OL>
<LI>To promote education of the various components of the justice system

<H3><A NAME = helping></A>Helping Prepare Children 
with FAS and FAE for School and Beyond</H3>
By Donna M. Burgess, Ph.D.<P>
Reprinted from Alcohol Health and Research World, Vol. 18, No. 1, 1994<P>
Until research becomes available to support the efficacy of specific educational programs 
for children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE), it is 
important to draw from the observations of educators of and families with children affected 
by these conditions and from experiences by those who deal with students with other 
developmental disabilities. Listed below are some basic principles for educating students 
with FAS or FAE that were developed based on the wisdom and experience of educators 
and families across the United States and Canada.<P>
<B>Begin early; teach students such functional skills as social interacting, problem 
solving, and decision making.</B><P><B>
</B>It is critical to teach functional skills in addition to a regular academic curriculum.  
Functional skills are those that students will need to become as independent as possible in 
their home, school, job and community and include learning to make decisions, solving 
problems, getting and keeping employment, and dealing with social interactions throughout 
life. Without these functional skills, many young people with FAS and FAE may face 
futures on the streets, in shelters, or in jail.  <P>
At the elementary school level, this may mean allowing a child more physical involvement 
or offering alternatives to large-group instruction through peer tutoring or cooperative 
learning groups.<P>
Planning community activities also can enhance student learning, ranging from field trips to 
outdoor curricula offered by local community agencies.<P>
During high school, individualized programs (see below) may necessitate finding innovative 
ways to meet academic requirements, providing counseling support, or designing on-the-
job training opportunities. The key is to make the program fit the needs of the student 
rather than to force the student into the confines of a certain program.<P>
<B>Develop reasonable expectations of students.</B><P><B>
</B>Because they may appear "normal" and may have IQ scores in the average range, 
students with FAS or FAE are often expected to excel in classes that are beyond their 
ability because of organizational and problem-solving deficits. For example, when these 
students fail to hand in homework or cannot construct a term paper, they may be labeled 
"lazy" or "unmotivated." To develop reasonable expectations, it is necessary to reform 
ideas of what is meant by "unmotivated" and recognize the biological (i.e. neurological) 
limitations of some students. At the same time, children should be given every opportunity 
to achieve their full potential. The process of balancing expectations with opportunities for 
success is a delicate one, and educational teams should give it full attention.<P>
<B>Individualize programs as much as possible.</B><P><B>
</B>Not all students with FAS and FAE experience mild mental retardation; they may in 
fact be bright. On the opposite end of the spectrum, they may suffer multiple disabilities. 
For this reason, it is important to recognize that no single curriculum can serve all students 
with these conditions. Therefore, educators should be skeptical if presented with a 
curriculum that claims to serve the needs of this entire population.<P>
<B>Concentrate on helping children to become as independent as possible as 
adults.</B><P><B>
</B>When parents recognize their child's difficulties with judgment, social skills and other 
life skills, they may worry about their child's future. That is a legitimate fear, considering 
the reports of young people who become involved with the justice system or who 
themselves become victims of crimes. Yet this is not the outcome for every child with FAS 
or FAE. Many are successful if the school and family work together to help them to 
become as independent as possible. Parents should begin to seek services as soon as they 
recognize that their child may have suffered some effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol or 
other drugs.<P>
<B>Recognize that challenging behaviours ore a form of 
communication.</B><P><B>
</B>Not all young people with FAS and FAE have behaviour problems. Among those 
who do have problems, however, school administrators report behaviours such as lying, 
stealing and sexually inappropriate activities (Burgess unpublished data). Parents and 
educators are frustrated because punishment does not seem to work, often, children and 
adolescents repeat the same behaviour again and again without seeming to understand the 
consequences or experience remorse. The critical step in planning behavioural intervention 
is to recognize that many of these behaviours are a form of communication. Rather than 
purposely trying to be malicious, children with FAS or FAE may be communicating that 
they do not understand the rules or that they forgot what they were supposed to do.<P>
<B>Use behavior management strategies that promote independence.</B><P><B>
</B>Rather than punishing children with FAS or FAE for undesirable behaviour, parents 
and educators can teach them positive skills. For example, if children tear up their material 
because the work is too hard, they can be taught to ask for help. These options would likely 
be more effective in helping children to become independent as adults.<P>
Students with FAS and FAE can be taught systematically so they learn responses that relate 
to judgment and impulse control. This takes willingness and effort on the part of educators 
and parents as well as the cooperation of specialist, health care providers and other 
professionals from community agencies.<P>

<H3><A NAME = supporting></A>Supporting Alternate 
Families and Caregivers of FAS/E 
Children/Teens/Adults</H3>
The following is a list of tips and suggestions for supporting alternate families and 
caregivers compiled by the FAS/E Support Network. The list arose from all the comments, 
suggestions and problems mentioned by families who have access the FAS/E Support 
Network for information and/or support.<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you haven't lived it, you haven't been there.
<LI>Listen, listen, listen! Really "hear" what is being said, and more importantly, what is 
not being said.
<LI>Understand this is not a "quick fix" or "easy solution" problem: it is a life-long 
disability with profound psychosocial implications for families as well as individuals.
<LI>Be available, return phone calls. . If you don't know, say so.
<LI>Learn from the parents and caregivers; they may have much to share.
<LI>Provide services pro-actively.
<LI>Find an advocate for the family until they can fill that role themselves.
<LI>Understand that parents, especially adoptive ones, may view the system as adversarial. 
They are afraid of you. The system is seen as all-powerful and needs to be more receptive.
<LI>Track down resources and aid families in using them. Make initial contacts, sort out 
red tape, learn the pitfalls, etc.
<LI>Provide access to training for understanding FAS/E and specific parenting techniques.
<LI>Don't wait for caregivers to call you. Check with them regularly, even when things are 
going well.
<LI>Develop a relationship with families <I>independent </I>of crisis.
<LI>Find respite care and/or a way to fund it.
<LI>Access information on the child for the family. Adoptive families often have little or 
not written information on their child; It may be useful and even necessary to call the file, 
and families have a right to know.
<LI>Parents, foster and adoptive, need specific and detailed information on what a child 
may have experienced if they are to deal with the aftermath.
<LI>Most FAS and FAE children have also suffered from abuse and/or neglect. 
Understanding how this effects the underlying neurological disorder and conduct problems 
is crucial. Both social workers and caregivers need training.
<LI>Social workers and caregivers (adoptive and foster) who attend training together on 
any issue are more likely to work together effectively.
<LI>Respect the parent's opinion and decisions. They must live with the consequences.
<LI>The child you see is not the child they live with.
<LI>Do not tell a parent he is overreacting, or that "all kids to that".
<LI>Asking what you can do to help the parent keep his head above water is important.
<LI>Meeting with both parents - not just the mother - is preferable, and may require 
adjusting work schedules.
<LI>Find a support group and/or buddy parent for the family: find a way to "stage 
manage" their involvement if they are unwilling; remember that exhausted people do not 
have the energy to seek out support - support needs to seek them.
<LI>Recognition that most parents who undertake to parent these children find themselves 
dealing with social and behavioural situations for which they are totally unprepared.
<LI>Adjustment to long term foster care or adoption is cyclical in nature. Children revisit 
the stages of grief and loss at different developmental stages, which simply put, means that 
managing behaviour and dealing with acting out - even independent of FAS and FAE - is 
an on-going task throughout the years, particularly in adolescence. <I>FAS and FAE 
compound the  problems.
</I><LI>Parents and caregivers also adjust in a cyclical nature and must re-visit their own 
issues and manage their own feelings, especially anger - which, it must be remembered, is a 
mask for pain. It is imperative that professionals working with families of FAS/E children 
keep this awareness in the forefront of their dealings with the family if support is to be 
effective.
<LI>Help parents to understand that the above two points do not mean they are failures or 
inadequate to the task, rather that this is part of the process.
<LI>View out-of-home placement as a positive option, not a negative one.  It is not 
necessarily an indication of placement breakdown/failure, but may, in fact, represent the 
commitment of a family to maintaining an adoption/foster placement in the face of very 
real difficulty.
<LI>Attend meetings with other systems with the caregivers if they request; offer to do so.
<LI>In complicated cases, a case manager may be required. Work with the parent to 
decide who would be best in this role and who would also best meet the needs of the 
caregiver.
<LI>Provide a family with all the options in a given situation, but allow them to make the 
decision.
<LI>Support the decision even if you disagree with it. The position of the professional 
should be to facilitate decision making, not to impose personal - or even professional - 
opinions.
<LI>Once an adoption placement has been made, or an official exception to policy 
permanent plan has been granted, the premise which guided the selection of that family 
should still be the premise when a family requests services or help: They were - and are - 
the best possible choice for that child. <I>Nothing </I>will disempower a family faster 
than the unstated but implicit opinion of a helping professionals (or other support person) 
that another family could do a better job. 
<LI>If the placement has irretrievably broken down, it is imperative that it be handled with 
the utmost compassion. Families - both long term foster and adoptive - are devastated and 
go through an intense grieving process. It is a death without a death. Intensive in-home and 
in person support which encourages expression of feelings (no matter how negative) and 
acknowledges the anger and pain should be provided.
<LI>Counseling for all family members should be accessed.
<LI>Some form of long term follow-up and social work support should be provided in a 
placement disruption. Even if the family is not receptive, they need to know concretely, 
that someone cares. At some point they will be ready to discuss what happened and what 
they feel could have been done differently. It is an important step in healing which 
frequently does not occur because there is no one whose job it is to keep making overtures 
to these families. Never, ever discuss a family, its children or any problems with any other 
person, professional, or system without the express, special permission for the specific 
occasion from the parent or caregiver. Confidentiality and the absence of ''judgment" are 
the backbone of effective support.

This is the second issue of FAS/E NATION. The response we have had to our first issue 
has been overwhelming. Requests for copies and subscriptions have been rolling in at an 
astounding rate. Now, the tick will be to keep up with expectations.<P>
This issue inaugurates the FAS FAMILIES section which will contain writing by parents 
and, we hope, children. The courage it takes to put difficult thoughts and feelings on paper 
is significant.<P>
It is our hope that through reading some of the articles written by families people will come 
to a better understanding of how they feel, have compassion for their pain, respect for their 
decisions and join in their successes.<P>
We welcome contributions from anyone. If you are a parent your experiences living with 
FAS/E, what worked and what didn't, how you feel about it all are extremely valuable to 
others. Please write.  If you have FAS/E yourself, your thoughts and feelings are always 
valuable to everyone. If you would like to write something for the newsletter, please send it 
in.<P>
We also encourage contributions to Life in FASOPOLIS - true anecdotes on the lighter 
side of FAS/E.<P>
So please, everyone write in with your own stories or if you have articles that were helpful

Women still are underrepresented in alcoholism treatment.  Recent national surveys 
estimated that 25 to 30 percent of people with alcohol problems are women (Wilsnack in 
press). Yet according to Government surveys in the late 1980's, women made up only 
about 20 percent of patients in alcoholism treatment programs (Blume in press).  Women 
face many gender-specific barriers that may limit their access to alcoholism treatment (see 
box).  These barriers can be  both internal (i.e., reflecting the woman's own perception of 
her drinking problem) and external (i.e., exerted by the woman's environment). The latter 
can be differentiated further into interpersonal and structural barriers.<P>
<B>Internal Barriers</B><P><B>
</B>Alcohol-abusing women often have a different perception of their problem than do 
alcohol abusing men. Women frequently do not believe that drinking is their main problem 
but instead perceive alcohol use as a coping response to a specific crisis or to problematic 
social situations (Reed 1987; Thom 1986). Gomberg (1993) reported that the most 
frequent reasons given by women for seeking treatment were depression; medical problems 
related to alcohol use; problems with partner, spouse, or children; and, especially among 
middle age women, "empty nest" situations related to children leaving home.<P>
Because of this different perception, women are less likely than men to seek help initially in 
alcoholism or other chemical dependency services. Instead, women prefer consulting 
physicians or mental health clinics staff, setting sin which their primary problem is less 
likely to be diagnosed as alcohol abuse (Reed 1987; Thom 1986). It is critical that the 
women's alcohol problems be identified correctly in these settings and that appropriate 
interventions be initiated.<P>
There still is greater social stigma associated with alcohol abuse for women than for men 
(Reed 1987). The resulting reluctance to be labeled as "alcoholic" may cause women to 
deny or minimize their drinking problems and to delay seeking treatment (Wilsnack in 
press).<P>
Women may avoid treatment because they do not want to leave their children or do not 
have the resources to arrange for independent child care. They also may fear that their 
children would be taken away from them because of the addition (Wilsnack in press).  
Finally, women often delay entering alcoholism treatment because of feelings of guilt and 
shame. They consider admitting to an alcohol problem as an indication of their failure to 
fulfill adequately the roles of mother, wife and/or sexual partner (Beckwith and Amaro 
1986).<P>
<B>External Barriers</B><P><B>
<U></B>Interpersonal Barriers</U>. Women with drinking problems generally seem to 
experience more barriers in their social environments than do men. According to one study, 
family and friends are more likely to oppose the treatment entry of  white women than of 
white men (Beckwith and Amaro 1986). Social stigma, economic concerns, and perceived 
conflict with family roles may be reasons underlying this lack of support.<P>
The opposition of family members to treatment and, consequently, the disruption of family 
relationships are part of the "social costs" associated by many women with alcoholism 
treatment. Other factors, such as avoidance by friends or coworkers and feelings of 
loneliness, also may discourage women from seeking help.<P>
<U>Structural Barriers</U>. Women's entry into alcoholism treatment also can be 
hindered by their referral patterns, which are different from those of men. (Duckert 1987). 
Women are less likely than men to be referred through conventional routes, such as 
physicians, the legal system, and employers. More often, they are referred by family or 
friends and learn about specific programs through advertisements or word of mouth 
(Beckman and Kocel 1982).  Physicians would seem an excellent source of referral, yet at 
least one large study found them to be less effective in identifying alcohol abuse in women 
than in men (Moore et al. 1989). This highlights the need to train health care providers to 
diagnose, treat, and refer competently women with alcohol problems.<P>
Women may be kept from seeking treatment by the lack of women-sensitive treatment in 
existing programs. Studies have shown that the proportion of female clients is greater in 
programs that provide services for children and follow-up care and that have more women 
on their professional staff than in program without these characteristics (Beckman and 
Kocel 1982).<P>
Some women also experience economic barriers to treatment. These barriers include low 
income (which may not allow them to arrange for independent child care) and inadequate 
insurance coverage for alcoholism treatment services.<P>
<U>Subgroup Differences</U>. The predominant barriers can vary for different 
subgroups of women. For example, for white women the personal and social costs 
associated with treatment entry are an important factor (Beckwith and Amaro 1986). 
African-American women, on the other hand, are more influenced by structural 
(particularly economic) than by interpersonal factors (Beckman 1994).  <P>
<B>How Can Treatment for Women Be Improved?</B><P><B>
</B>To remove the barriers that restrict women's access to alcoholism treatment, several 
measures can be taken:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Educate the general public. Such education is essential for removing individual and 
interpersonal barriers based on the stigma against alcohol-abusing women.
<LI>Increase the knowledge about women's drinking problems to improve detection and 
referral by physicians, the legal system, and employee assistance programs. Informal 
referral networks, such as friends and family members, also should be used more 
efficiently.
<LI>Implement routine alcoholism screening programs in pregnancy and family planning 
clinics and obstetrician/gynecologists' offices to aid in the identification of women with 
alcohol problems.
<LI>Improve the availability of services for children. These services may include 
supervision while the woman is participating in treatment activities, diagnosis and treatment 
for children with behavioural problems, and education about the mother's alcoholism.
<LI>Increase the availability of other women-sensitive services that address gender-specific 
problems and treatment issues and that consider women's social contexts. It also is 
important for outreach efforts to highlight such characteristics when they are present in 
treatment services.
<LI>Improve the outreach to women at risk for drinking problems. Known risk factors 
include a family history of alcoholism; a heavy-drinking partner; drinking patterns that are 
discrepant from those of the partner; cohabitation; lack of social rules, loss of social roles, 
or involuntary social roles; depression and anxiety; childhood sexual or physical abuse; 
physical violence or sexual assault in adulthood; and sexual problems.

<H3><A NAME = have></A>I Have FAS/E - An Alcohol 
Affected Adult's Perspective</H3>
<I>The following is an article written by a very "high functioning" adult with FAS/E. She 
talks about what its like having FAS/E and what she feels is needed in the way of support 
and services.</I><P><I>
</I>Two years ago I was assessed and found to be affected by alcohol my mother had 
consumed while she was pregnant with me. At forty-five years old this was quite a 
revelation for me. Up to that point, I had considered many plausible explanations for the 
difficulties I had experienced in everyday life.<P>
Some of the reasons for my dysfunction which I considered were as follows. I seriously 
pondered the possibility I was multiple personality, at would have accounted for the 
memory lapses I have experienced throughout my life. Many times family and friends 
have-reminisced about the past, and try as I might I could not recall the event, often the 
whole time-frame. It was simply not there. So, I thought maybe I lived those events as a 
different personality. The huge gap in the level of my performance from day to day, 
sometime, moment to moment, prompted me to seek psychiatric care and while they had 
difficulty, they did find a slot for me. I then was treated as a manic depressive. Atypical 
was the adjective they used and indeed I was. For five years I took medication such as 
lithium and antidepressants until quite literally I'd find myself forgetting what city bus I was 
on or even where I was going, if ever I attempted to go anywhere. Those five years are my 
nightmare years. But the result of my description of the vast difference in a good day 
versus a bad day, led them to believe this was due to mood swings. They tried to help, but 
it became worse.<P>
Since my assessment, I no longer muse about what may be wrong with me. I now know. 
My time is now spent just coping with it. And reading about it. My aim in life is to be as 
productive, responsible and independent as I can be.<P>
deficits and attention deficit disorder problems to use on a day-to-day basis specific to the 
individual would be most helpful. I have discovered that some techniques such as 
visualization of tasks before I attempt to perform them, meditation and many other tactics 
improve the quality of my performance and in turn my life. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome can 
be prevented and many and resources need to be invented in these areas. Early childhood 
intervention and modified teaching and behavioural approaches must be delivered. But, as 
an adult, I know after all of that we are out here, it is not going away, and we need 
practical and moral support on an ongoing basis.<P>
Because of my age, it was not possible to determine for sure whether I have full syndrome 
or FAE. Personally I expect the former, with as good an upbringing as two loving parents 
could provide, taking up some of the slack.<P>
As an adult who is coping with the deficits of this syndrome I wish to share my perspective 
on the current literature I have been exposed to. I guess you could call them my sore points 
regarding the presentation of 'support' to individuals dealing with FAS/FAE.  My first 
concern is almost everything being produced at the moment is professional and caregiver 
directed. Certainly, this is essential; however, individuals do grow up, some are adults when 
we discover the problem and the vast numbers since 1975 will need practical strategies and 
some clear understanding of their individual shortfalls and, as importantly, their strong 
points to be as productive and independent as possible. Are there any studies being 
undertaken from an occupational therapy approach? Developing strategies regarding 
memory<P>
My second concern is the lack of information regarding exactly what is happening when a 
person with FAS/E displays, for lack of a better term, inappropriate behaviour. More often 
than not the behaviour itself is addressed as if it came from a fully functional individual. 
And obviously it hasn't. What I mean is if a blind person bumps into an object, no one 
would call him clumsy. However, if a kid living with FAS is disruptive because he's 
unaware that his pencil's tapping is annoying, why is he called obnoxious. To my way of 
thinking, this is inappropriate.  Another example I take issue with is the manner in which 
the problems regarding cause and effect are addressed. The ways I have seen the 
phenomena explained is the individual has difficulty understanding the concept itself. I 
don't agree. From personal experience, I have often found<P>
that indeed I did think an action through and fully understood the consequences natural or 
otherwise - I simply did not consider one scenario. My clarity looking back is perfect - I 
understand how what I did resulted in what happened. My brain did not present me with 
crucial information I needed. I know right from wrong and morally, in terms of intention, 
would hold myself up against anyone. I think it would be more fair to assume I lacked 
information when I decided on a certain action, than to view a mistake from a value 
judgment perspective.<P>
Last, my difficulties have usually arisen through the world's perception of me. Not the 
reverse. I am fully aware of my deficits, and I would give anything to be able to translate 
my vision and my knowledge to perform as well as is my intention. But often I am unable 
to. At the very least assume this when dealing with us. <P>

<H3><A NAME = fase2></A>The FAS/E Support 
Network</H3>
The purpose of the FAS/E Support Network is to encourage the provision of information, 
support and services for families, professionals and the broader community around 
prevention, intervention and treatment issues relating to alcohol related birth defects, 
including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Effect and other disabilities caused by drug use during 
pregnancy.<P>
Its mandate is to specifically aid in, and advocate for, the development of home, school and 
community based services which will better meet the needs of affected individuals, their 
families and professionals working with them.<P>
In working towards these objectives, the Network recognizes the strengths inherent in birth, 
foster and adoptive families, and their commitment to these children and adults. Facilitation 
of parent support is strongly encouraged; the opportunity for parents to talk, on a regular 
basis, to other parents who are also caring for children and adults with FAS/E is invaluable. 
Often it is only other parents, who are also coping with the complexities of parenting these 
multifaceted people, who can understand and empathize with the problems being faced. 
Parents can often learn different methods for working more successfully with an affected 
individual by brainstorming with other parents who have "been there" before. At the very 
least, they will find understanding, acceptance and support.<P>
A telephone "warm line" exists to facilitate this process, and to provide both parents and 
the professional community with current and specific information. It provides a 
knowledgeable "on call" person who can be reached at any time. These services are 
currently provided at no cost to the recipient.<P>
As part of its advocacy work, the Support Network seeks to act as a voice with 
Government, both locally, provincially and federally. Members sit on various committees 
whose mandates are as diverse as specialized educational programming and criminal justice 
issues. If you have concerns you would like to make committee members aware of, please 
leave a message on the "warm line."<P>
The Network is also active in the research, design and development of resource material 
for FAS/E and the provision of a broad range of training programs.<P>

My daughter has FAS. She is 11 1/2 years old. <P>
Recently her school class was doing a project on ancestors and had spent some time 
learning about this topic.  One day, she came home after school all excited and asked me to 
phone my friend Anne right away. When I asked her why  she said "Because I have to 
know who Anne's sisters are in school tomorrow".<P><B>

<H3><A NAME = developmental></A>Developmental 
Timelines and FAS/E</H3>
People with FAS/FAE may present a complex portrait of competencies and delays. It is not 
uncommon to encounter a mix of abilities and lags in any one person. The profile of 
maturation and strengths varies significantly between people with FAS/E. This chart is 
intended to provide a visual cue for gaps which may be masked by abilities (i.e., emotional 
dismaturity may be hidden by strong expressive language skills.)<P>

A gradual catch up is noted in young adults with FAS/E. Rather than being able to leave 
home at 18, a more realistic timeline may be 25 to 30. Ask yourself what responsibilities 
would be reasonable to expect from a 10 year old when confronted by a tall, verbal 16 year 
old with FAS/E. Expectations should be adjusted accordingly.<P>

concept of cause and effect or behaviour and consequence
</UL>
<LI>The pain of frustrated siblings whose plans are constantly disrupted. Parents can't put 
the child with FAS/E "on hold" because without supervision children with FAS/E can 
generate serious safety hazards in a very short period time. Consequently, the demands of 
the child with FAS/E usually come first. Siblings will eventually either erupt in rage at the

<LI>The exhaustion from the lack of physical rest, sleep and recreational activities. By the 
time our toddlers reach childhood, our extended family members and close friends are fed 
up and burned out. Or parents say, they  are just too embarrassed by the child's disruptive

<LI>The panic of knowing that your child is growing older and has a serious behaviour 
problem. Parents describe the cold fear that grips their hearts because they realize by the 
time the child reaches 9 or 10 that he/she is in desperate need of an appropriate treatment 
direction. As feelings of panic wash over parents, hope often dies because <U>no</U> 
one will listen.  Everyone jumps to conclusions that the chaos is caused by the parents'

<B>Celebration</B><P><B>
</B>We are celebrating our 11th anniversary in September - eleven years since we became 
adoptive parents of "Andy", a 5 month old, healthy boy, our first child.<P>
The next 4 years flew by as 3 more children were born into our family. Those years were 
busy, tiring and joyful as our dreams of a family were fulfilled. But, as those years went 
by, we became more and more aware of "Andy's" delays and difficulties. He had his own 
special language - we interpreted his words and gestures for others outside our family. His 
younger sibling taught him new words (Mama, Dada) that "Andy" hadn't learned by his 
second birthday. His hearing tested normal. So began our quest to find the answers to 
"Andy's" problems and how best to meet his needs. Special needs preschool plus 
physiotherapy and occupational therapy were advised and undertaken to meet his severe 
developmental delays. <P>
Over the next few years, medical tests followed by psycho-educational tests defined some 
of the problems "Andy" faced but gave us few answers to our questions "why", and "how 
to maximize" our son's potential. We heard "learning disabled", "attention deficit disorder", 
"hyper-activity", "autism-like mannerisms". We joined the Learning Disabilities Association 
of B.C. and then the Society of Special Needs Adoptive Parents and met many families 
like ours. We listened to "professionals" - doctors, teachers, more doctors and therapists. 
By chance I came across an article outlining the criteria found in children handicapped by 
prenatal exposure to alcohol  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. I couldn't believe what I was 
reading - description of our son! Several months later, at 7 1/2 years of age, "Andy" was 
diagnosed as having F.A.S. <P>
We thought we had reached the end of our quest - but this "answer" brought even more 
questions and challenges. Advocacy became our theme as we worked with the education 
"system" to create a plan for "Andy's" education. We worked with the social services 
"system" and the health care "system" to obtain respite care for our struggling family and 
appropriate medical care for "Andy's" various needs. Our marriage was tested and our 
family bonds were stretched to the limits. We joined a Fetal Alcohol Syndrome parent 
support group and shared our tears, our fears and eventually our joys and our victories. We 
tried to support other families, to feel successful and to learn whatever we could that would 
benefit our family members. We managed to survive and even laughed now and then. But, 
by "Andy's" 10th birthday we had run out of energy - energy to advocate, energy to parent, 
energy to cope. We had to face "impossible" choices. We chose to place "Andy" in foster 
care (by agreement with the Ministry of Social Services). We struggled to convince "the 
system" of "Andy's" need for a caregiver experienced in working with a child suffering 
such severe brain damage.<P>
Four months later, "Andy" moved out of our home. We felt as though a death had 
occurred in our family. We cried, we screamed, we became ill (in turn, so someone was 
left to hang on to what was left of the rest of our family!). We survived the next 
months.<P>
Now, a year later, "Andy" continues to live an hours drive from our home. We see him 
several times a month and speak with his foster Mom ("Barb") between visits. «Andy" 
comes "home" for some weekends and this summer spent two 10 day visits with us. He is a 
loving  boy who tries so hard to figure out his environment. "Barb" provides the structure 
and routine life that we could no longer give and which is crucial for "Andy" to feel safe 
and to prevent his behaviours from escalating out of control. "Andy" still explodes verbally 
and physically when he feels stressed. A simple change in routine (a sandwich instead of 
soup for lunch) can precipitate hours of crying and screaming. "Barb" plans frequent 
respite for herself, something essential for caregivers of challenging children. Sometimes I 
wonder . . . . could we have maintained our son in our home longer if only we had known 
his diagnosis sooner? If only we had had more respite, more support from the beginning, if 
only.... ?<P>
We have suffered a loss and still grieve. The pain is less some days now. We try to dwell 
on the positives. Our love for "Andy" continues, as does his for us, his parents, siblings and 
extended family. We intend to do whatever is necessary to safeguard "Andy" and provide 
for his well-being. After all, he is our son, no matter what, irrevocably. So we celebrate 
eleven years, celebrate parenthood, celebrate SUCCESS because we are successful, even 
though our family is not the one we envisioned eleven years ago.<P>
<P>
<B>It Happened to Me</B><P>
"How could you be so stupid?" How often does one hear that in day to day life? I'm the 
birth parent of a child with Fetal Alcohol Effect. I think that every day of my life, past, 
present and future. It will take me a long time to forgive myself.<P>
We all have great expectations for our child, that they become famous or renowned. We 
want the best to shine out, the things we didn't or couldn't do to be brought forward 
through our children. When you have a child with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Effects, that 
dream or expectation is totally shattered. The irreversible damage that has been done to the 
child is devastating for the child, his family and friends. The effects are disabling beyond 
comprehension.<P>
What is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effects? It's a birth defect which causes 
brain damage as well as physical problems. It is caused by women drinking when they're 
pregnant. I am middle-class, Caucasian and have a high school education. It happened to 
me, it can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.<P>
There is no cure, just hope, patience and lots of love.<P>
What happens when you drink during pregnancy? You literally pickle your child in alcohol. 
It's like a soaked, porous sponge absorbing all the alcohol to the brain. The child suffers for 
life and the parents for all you've done. I did not deliberately set out to do this. I knew the 
effects of alcohol use during pregnancy. I was single at the time, living the good life, not 
knowing I was pregnant. I thought I might be pregnant, but when I went to the doctor he 
said my test was negative so I kept drinking. I stopped around 4 months later when a test 
finally came back positive. So, it's not my fault? Yes, it is. If you have the slightest doubt 
that you might be pregnant, stop drinking.<P>
My son has attitude, learning and behaviour problems. He'll never be a physicist but at least 
he's not disfigured. I was lucky. He is now 11 years old. His disability will become more 
visible because as his friends are maturing, he is still acting goofy and eventually his friends 
will notice the difference.<P>
As a parent one has high hopes of their child reaching full potential and above. My son will 
never be academic or a financial wizard but he is pretty good at hands on work. He may 
never become fully independent and may live with us the rest of his life. He may never be 
able to explore, to feel, to love. We may never be grandparents. These are a lot of 
"maybes" and it does give you a lot to think about.<P>
Please don't drink during pregnancy. Don't do this to your child or your family. Every life 
deserves a fair chance. FAS/E children don't even get past the starting gate.<P>
Don't drink during pregnancy. I cannot express how important this is not to do! The affects 
are just too devastating to comprehend and they are for life.<P>
FAS/E is 100% irreversible, but it is also 100% preventable.<P>

</B>HELP, HELP! I keep screaming. But no one seems to understand. Some days it feels 
like all I'm doing is asking for understanding. I sit and talk, cry for hours sometimes, but no 
one has a clue what I am crying about.<P>
I love my baby so much. But how much can you be loving and still hang on to that 
happiness? That's how my life has been for ten years. I stand, he sits; l walk, he stops; I 
sleep, he's awake; I'm nice, he's mean. But I love him now and always. My F.A.E. baby.

<I>Reprinted from Alcohol, Health and Research World, vol. 18, #1, 1994</I><P><I>
</I>Research on the nutritional, hormonal and cellular events regulating fetal development 
may help guide early intervention in children with FAS<P>
The condition known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was first described in the late 
1960's. FAS consists of a characteristic pattern of abnormalities resulting from exposure of 
the human fetus to alcohol during early development. These abnormalities include growth 
deficiency; a pattern of malformations affecting the head, face, heart, and urinary tract; and 
abnormalities within the brain that lead to various intellectual and behavioral problems in 
early childhood (Jones et al. 1974; Clarren et al. 1978; Shaywitz et al. 1980).<P>
Many factors play a role in the development of FAS. Among these are the frequency and 
quantity of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the timing of alcohol intake 
during gestation, the stage of development of the fetus at the time of its exposure to 
alcohol, the nutritional status of the mother and her intake of other drugs, the genetic 
background of the mother and of the fetus, and the mother's overall state of health. This 
article discusses the effects of alcohol on the cellular and molecular development of the 
fetus that may underlie the appearance of FAS in the newborn.<P>
<B>Stages of fetal development</B><P><B>
</B>Human gestation is divided into two major periods: the embryonic period (up to 8 
weeks of gestation) and the fetal period (from 8 weeks to delivery). It is during the 
embryonic period that malformations are readily produced by various drugs introduced 
directly into the maternal bloodstream or administered through the maternal diet. Chemical 
or physical agents that produce fetal malformations are called teratogens, from <I>teraton, 
</I>the Greek word for monster. Most teratogens show selectivity's for certain organs, 
based on the timing of exposure of the embryo to the teratogen, the dose of the teratogen 
taken by the mother, and the sensitivity of the dividing cells of each primordial organ to the 
teratogen's effects (Larsson 1973).<P>
Organs and limbs of a developing embryo are formed from collections of specialized cells. 
Exposure of an embryo to a teratogen during the period when primordial cells of an organ 
are actively proliferating may have devastating effects on the formation of that organ.<P>
Malformations of the head and face are the most common malformations in FAS and are 
correlated with exposure to alcohol during the embryonic stage and with the dose of 
alcohol consumed by the mother (Jones et al. 1974; Emhart et al. 1987).<P>
The first stage of events is cell division and proliferation. The second stage is cell growth 
and differentiation, by which cells become specialized in structure and function. For 
example, an embryonic nerve cell begins to develop the spines and branches that 
distinguish it, in part, from other types of cells. The final stage is the migration of maturing 
cells to their ultimate locations in the developing embryo, where they remain and adhere to 
the surrounding matrix of cells. Nutritional, hormonal, and cellular factors direct each of 
the above stages. Alcohol can affect many of these factors, thereby influencing organ 
formation and growth.<P>
<B>Mechanisms of alcohol's embryonic effects</B><P><B>
</B>Scientists have relied heavily on the use of experimental animals and in vitro models - 
whole embryos or cells grown in a test tube or petri dish-to help them determine the 
molecular and cellular events affected by exposure of embryonic tissues to alcohol. Such 
models are not ideal for studying how alcohol affects the human fetus, in part because 
other animal species do not metabolize alcohol exactly as humans do However, such 
models enable scientists to study the effects of alcohol on fetal cells in the absence of 
confounding factors such as malnutrition, disease, or concomitant abuse of other 
drugs.<P>
Although it has been suggested that the primary metabolic product of alcohol, 
acetaldehyde, could produce some damaging effects, all descriptions in this article of 
molecular and cellular mechanisms of alcohol-induced malformations are presented as 
direct effects of the alcohol on cells. The reasons for placing the focus on alcohol rather 
than acetaldehyde include the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol is distributed rapidly and nearly equally in maternal and fetal tissues (Ho et al. 
1972; Brien et al. 1983).
<LI>Alcohol applied directly onto embryos in vitro under conditions in which no 
acetaldehyde is formed causes growth retardation (Snyder et al. 1992).
<LI>Inhibition of the conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde has no effect on the embryonic 
damage produced by alcohol
<LI>Measurable quantities of acetaldehyde are not present in the blood of alcoholics unless 
there is a genetic defect in the enzyme that breaks down acetaldehyde
</UL>
<B>Nutritional Factors</B><P><B>
</B>Children suffering from FAS commonly have low birth weight and remain small for 
their age (Jones et al. 1974). Normal growth and development during the gestational period 
requires the transfer of a constant supply of amino acids and glucose from the mother to 
the fetus across the placenta. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, the basic 
structural and functional elements of cells. The sugar glucose is the cell's major fuel source, 
providing energy for the synthesis of proteins and the cell's genetic material, or DNA.<P>
Several studies with human placental tissue have shown that alcohol directly inhibits the 
transport of both amino acids and glucose (Snyder et al. 1986; Schenker et al. 1989). In 
experimental animals, the alcohol-exposed fetus suffers from selective amino acid 
deficiencies (Lin et al. 1990). Rat embryos exposed to alcohol in vitro exhibited marked 
growth retardation, decreased glucose metabolism, and diminished protein synthesis 
(Snyder et al. 1992). Thus, alcohol ingested by the mother deprives fetal tissues of the 
energy sources and materials needed for cell proliferation, growth, and differentiation.<P>
In what may appear as a paradox, some organs of the developing fetus, such as the brain, 
are relatively protected during early periods of development against the damage caused by 
malnutrition, unless the malnutrition reaches very severe levels (Dobbing 1974). This 
points to the importance of the timing of exposure of fetal organs to alcohol; for example, 
Bonthius and West (1990) described the damaging effects of binge alcohol intake on 
different populations of nerve cells during later stages of development of the brain.<P>
Supplemental glucose can partially reverse the developmental delays and metabolic 
abnormalities seen in embryos following alcohol exposure in vitro (Snyder et al. 1992). 
However, in experimental situations in which high protein diets were administered to rat 
mothers together with high amounts of alcohol, there was no diminution of fetal growth 
retardation associated with alcohol (Weinberg 1985). Therefore, nutritional 
supplementation may have only marginally beneficial effects on the fetus exposed to 
alcohol unless there are specific nutrients whose metabolism is blocked by alcohol.<P>
Other nutritional deficiencies reported in either human alcoholic mothers or their infants 
include those of trace metals, such as zinc, and vitamins. As described in a review by 
Schenker and colleagues (1990), the presence of trace metal deficiencies during gestation 
in experimental models of FAS is controversial (Beer et al. 1992). With respect to vitamin 
deficiencies, there is evidence for decreased transfer of a form of vitamin B6 from an 
alcoholic mother to her fetus through the placenta (Schenker et al. 1992); this vitamin 
functions in protein metabolism. In addition, a possible defect in the metabolism of folic 
acid has been identified in some tissues of a fetus exposed to alcohol during gestation (Lin 
et al. 1992) Folic acid plays an important role in the synthesis of new DNA, and folic acid 
deficiencies during gestation produce malformations in the fetus. It is-hypothesized that 
alcohol leads to a state of relative folic acid deficiency, which may account for some of the 
organ malformations seen in FAS.  There is no evidence of vitamin A deficiency in the 
liver or blood of fetuses from experimental animals fed alcohol through the gestational 
period. Instead vitamin A appears to accumulate in the liver of the alcohol-exposed fetus 
(Leichter et al. 1991), suggesting that the vitamin is not being metabolized normally. This 
may be significant, be  cause vitamin A is metabolized to a substance stance called retinoic 
acid. In many developing cells, retinoic acid functions as a chemical signal for the 
activation of DNA transcription, the first step in the synthesis of new proteins. Therefore, 
the lack of retinoic acid may be responsible for some of the developmental delays and 
malformations seen in FAS (Duester 1991; Pullarkat 1991).<P>
<B>Hormonal Factors</B><P><B>
</B>The processes of cell proliferation and differentiation are controlled by many internal 
stimuli, both chemical and physical, emanating from the milieu of the developing- tissues. 
The production and release of hormones from both maternal and fetal glands and from the 
placenta influence the formation and development of tissues as diverse as the brain and the 
palate. For example, in experimental animals exposed in the uterus alcohol, there is a 
decrease in blood and brain concentrations of corticosteroid hormones during the newborn 
period (Kakihana et al. 1980, Taylor et al. 1982). These hormones regulate various aspects 
of metabolism and influence the organism's response to stress. The deficiency in 
corticosteroid hormone production leads to deficits in the response of the newborn to 
stress. There are also deficits in the synthesis of a chemically related group of hormones, 
the sex steroid hormones. These hormone deficits may lead to the abnormal development 
of the brain, especially those specialized regions of the brain that differ between male and 
female and that control sex-related behaviour (Rudeen 1992).<P>
Thyroid hormone deficiencies during pregnancy also have been identified in the fetus born 
to human alcoholic mothers (Hernandez et al. 1992): these deficiencies may have a 
deleterious effect on the development of some tissues, in particular the brain (Hannigan 
and Bellisario 1990). In the cerebellum, a region of the brain that controls balance and 
posture, derangement's in the maturation and migration of nerve cells to their appropriate 
locations caused by thyroid hormone deficiencies are similar to those observed when 
experimental animals are exposed to alcohol at or shortly after birth (Kornguth et al. 
1979).<P>
Recent advances in molecular biology have provided new insights into how apparently 
disparate influences such as nutritional and hormonal factors may act in a coordinated 
manner to produce growth retardation and malformations. Hormones and other chemical 
messengers exert their effects on cells by binding to specific receptor proteins on the cell 
surface or inside the cells. It is now known that the receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid 
hormones, and retinoic acid are all members of a specific family of receptor proteins that 
regulate the transcription of DNA in a cell (Evans 1988). Under the influence of the 
appropriate hormones or other chemical messengers, these receptors can alter the rate of 
synthesis of proteins, thereby regulating the growth and differentiation of a cell. In 
addition, both thyroid hormone and retinoic acid regulate the synthesis of another 
hormone, growth hormone (Bedo et al. 1989). A relative reduction in growth hormone 
formation and release may contribute significantly to growth retardation in human 
FAS.<P>
<B>Local Growth Factors</B><P><B>
</B>In addition to nutritional and hormonal factors, whose effects are widespread, various 
chemical substances regulate cell development locally in the region where they are 
produced. Some of these substances affect cell proliferation, growth, and differentiation, 
whereas others modulate cell migration and adhesion. There is evidence that continued 
exposure of the fetus to alcohol may interfere with the function of at least some of these 
chemicals.<P>
Among these chemical substances are a group of proteins known as growth factors. 
Growth factors acting through surface receptors on cells powerfully stimulate the 
transcription of the genetic material and the synthesis of any proteins. This leads to the 
growth of cells as well as to differentiation, such as the branching of nerve cells or 
development of contractile fiber in muscle cells.<P>
Dow and Riopelle (1985) were the first to suggest that alcohol could diminish the effects of 
growth factors on nerve cells. Since then, studies have demonstrated reduced synthesis and 
release of a <I>nerve </I>growth-promoting factor in newborns exposed to alcohol during 
gestation (Heaton et al. 1992). Diminished protein synthesis by a newborn or fetus exposed 
in the uterus to alcohol has been repeatedly documented, especially in the brain (Tewari et 
al. 1992). Such diminution in protein synthesis may be the result of blunted action of 
growth factors in the fetus.  The brain regions of the hippocampus and cerebellum are 
particularly vulnerable to alcohol's inhibitory effects on protein synthesis (Peters and Steele 
1982). The hippocampus is a key brain area for human intellectual function and memory 
formation. Children with FAS have mild to severe deficits in these areas, with many of 
them exhibiting low intellectual functioning as determined by IQ tests, whereas others 
appear to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Shaywitz et al. 1980). Many of the 
children exhibit poor coordination of fine muscular movements. Some of these cognitive 
deficits and learning disabilities may be related to hippocampal damage produced during 
fetal alcohol exposure, whereas some of the movement disorders may result from damage 
to the cerebellum.<P>
<B>Prostaglandins</B><P><B>
</B>Prostaglandins are local tissue chemicals derived from fatty substances, especially 
from arachidonic acid. Prostaglandin activity is markedly increased during exposure of the 
fetus to alcohol in the uterus (Schenker et al. 1990; Anton et al. 1990). These chemicals 
have powerful effects on the blood vessels of the uterus, placenta, and fetus Their 
overproduction may be responsible for tissue hypoxia (lack of oxygen) brought about by 
prostaglandin-induced constriction of blood vessels<P>
Lack of oxygen functions as a trigger for cells in different tissues, such as the heart, to 
convert more arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (Kukreja and Hess 1992). This process 
would aggravate the preexisting hypoxia and, in the fetus exposed to alcohol, could lead to 
further tissue damage and growth retardation. This vicious cycle can be stopped by 
inhibiting the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin. Medications that can 
accomplish this include the anti-inflammatory drugs aspirin and indomethacin. These 
medications have been tested in experimentally induced FAS in animals and are of 
potential benefit for preventing some of the malformations caused by fetal alcohol 
exposure (Randall et al. 1987).<P>
<B>Oxygen Effects</B><P><B>
</B>Diminished oxygen delivery to fetal tissues during maternal drinking may result either 
from the local release of Prostaglandins as described above or from a direct action of 
alcohol on blood vessels of the placenta and umbilical cord. Alcohol has been shown to 
constrict these blood vessels, (Mukherjee and Hodgen 1982), possibly by inducing the 
release of substances (endothelins) produced by cells lining the inner walls of the blood 
vessels (Tsuji et al. 1992). The increased production and release of these substances can 
markedly diminish blood circulation to tissues, inducing hypoxia and setting the stage for 
cessation or delays in cell proliferation, growth, or migration.<P>
Following exposure of the fetus to alcohol during early gestation, the primordial cells that 
will form part of the nervous system and those that will form the tubules of the kidney 
show signs of damage or impending death (Gage and Sulik 199 1; Petkov et al. 1992; 
Assadi and Zajac 1992). Some of these changes are similar to those observed in cells 
injured by hypoxia in adult animal tissues (Siesjo 198 1 ). Hypoxia may therefore, be the 
common mechanism that brings about developmental delays and malformations in several 
types of tissues.<P>
Hypoxia also causes the formation of free radicals, toxic by-products of oxygen 
metabolism. Alcohol itself also induces free radical formation in some embryonic cells 
(Davis et al. 1990). Free radicals can damage-e the cell surface, allowing calcium to leak 
into and accumulate in the cells (Kukreja and Hess 1992). The abnormal accumulation of 
calcium in nerve cells may cause them to release neurotransmitters, chemicals by which 
nerve cells communicate. Some of these neurotransmitters may have toxic effects of their 
own on certain cells.  An organ that is particularly sensitive to hypoxia and that is most 
frequently damaged by alcohol abuse by the pregnant mother is the brain. The most 
common brain abnormalities in FAS are a decrease in the overall size of the brain and a 
diminution in the thickness of the outer layers of the brain (cortex). The decrease in size of 
the cortex is due to decreases in the total numbers of cells. Nerve cells depend on a 
continuous supply of oxygen and glucose to meet their energy needs. When nerve cells are  
stressed by decreased oxygen and glucose supplies, as may happen in FAS, they release 
large quantities of glutamic acid (Choi 1992). Glutamic acid is an amino acid that functions 
as a neurotransmitter. When this chemical is released from the branches of one nerve cell, 
it acts on the surface of another nerve cell, causing a transient electrical pulse. An excessive 
amount of this electrical activity can produce swelling and damage to nerve cells, primarily 
through entry into the cells of excessive sodium and calcium.<P>
<B>Impaired Cell Migration and Adhesion</B><P><B>
</B>During brain development, certain types of cells are programmed to move to precise 
locations so that they can serve a specific role in the overall coordinated activity of the 
brain. In many FAS children, these nerve cells have failed to migrate to their appropriate 
sites. Scientists have reproduced these abnormalities in experimental animals and have 
referred to these clumps of misplaced cells as "braid warts" (Kotkoskie and Norton 1988; 
Miller 1993). It is assumed that these misplaced cells are not fulfilling their normal roles 
within the brain; therefore, this phenomenon may contribute to the observed mental deficits 
in FAS.<P>
Very complex molecules in the local environment surrounding the maturing cells promote 
appropriate cell movement and adhesion. Alcohol apparently interferes with the cellular 
response to these molecules (Gatalica and Damjanov 199 1). If the maturing cell does not 
detect the subtle gradients of these chemicals, then it will not initiate migration or will fail to 
complete it correctly. This is apparently what happens with various types of brain cells 
(Miller 1993).<P>
The incorrect migration of some nerve cells within the brain also may be linked to the 
abnormalities in calcium regulation and the release of glutamic acid described earlier 
(Komuro and Rakic 1992. 1993). Gradients produced by small differences in local levels 
of glutamic acid or other neurotransmitters may be what orients these cells as they migrate 
toward their final destinations. If they are bombarded by excessive amounts of the 
neurotransmitters from all directions, as may occur during oxygen or glucose deprivation 
caused by maternal alcohol, these developing nerve cells may stop their migration and form 
a brain wart.<P>
<B>Conclusions</B><P>
Many crucial biochemical and cellular events are affected by exposure of the fetus to 
alcohol during gestation. It is too early to speculate whether any one of alcohol's effects on 
molecular or cellular function is more significant than others. Considerable experimental 
effort will be required simply to validate that alcohol disrupts some of the same 
biochemical and cellular processes in humans as it does in experimental animals. Perhaps 
one day such information can be used to guide early interventions with FAS children
interventions that may help to reverse or minimize some of the deleterious effects of this 
widely consumed drug on the developing fetus.<P>

<H1>First HEALTHY BABY 
MONTH<BR>
an Overwhelming Success</H1>
The first annual Healthy Baby Month Campaign took place February 14 to March 15, 1996.  It was a province 
wide effort to highlight prenatal care through a coordinated public awareness campaign.  Many organizations and 
individuals took part in the campaign, each developing their own initiative with a primary emphasis on 
FAS/FAE<B>.  </B>The campaign was coordinated by the Committee on Alcohol and Pregnancy, a coalition 
representing more than thirty associations and agencies concerned with FAS/FAE.<P>
"Our objective was to raise awareness of the key issues surrounding Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal 
Alcohol Effects" say Clarence Nepinak and Barbara Nepinak, Co-chairs of Healthy Baby Month.  "More 
importantly," they continue, "we wanted the community to undertake its own initiatives and seek out ways to 
focus attention on FAS/FAE.  We have been tremendously pleased at the efforts that were made throughout the 
province."  Over sixty (60) agencies took part in hosting various Healthy Baby Month activities.  "Given the level 
of inter-agency support that was achieved on this project, there is no doubt that we will repeat Healthy Baby 
Month in 1997," concluded  Mr. Nepinak.  "A great deal of concern and awareness has been generated and this 
must continue!"  For further information contact Clarence Nepinak at 983-4605 or Dale Kendel at 947-1118.<P>
<H1>WARNING LABEL BILL C-
337</H1>
A bill, introduced by Paul Szabo, Liberal MP for Mississauga South, has gone to the Standing Committee on 
Health for public hearings prior to returning to the House of Commons for third and final reading.  Bill C-337 
will require health warnings on labels of alcoholic beverages.  The warning would focus on fetal alcohol 
syndrome and on birth defects caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy.  Mr. Szabo is calling for public 
support to help the bill pass.  A petition to the House is available for circulation, or individuals are asked to write 
or fax their MP.  "Warning labels have been mandatory in the U.S. since 1989 and it's time Canada moved 
forward to bring greater attention to the risks of alcohol consumption, particularly as it relates to pregnant 
women",  stated Mr. Szabo.<P>
<P>
<H2>WHAT IS FAS</H2>
FAS stands for <B>fetal alcohol syndrome</B>, the condition some babies are born with when their 
mothers drink alcohol while pregnant.  These babies are smaller than normal, they have a variety of physical 
abnormalities, and serious, permanent brain damage.  The tragedy is that FAS is not curable, but it is entirely 
preventable.  If a mother does not drink alcohol while pregnant, her baby will not be born with FAS.<P>
<HR>
<H2>FAMILY SUPPORT</H2>
<H3>MEALS ON WHEELS</H3>
Meals on Wheels has started a new program targetted at prenatal and postnatal women and their children.  
The program provides meals to mothers who can not meet their own nutritional needs due to lack of resources or 
support.  Women are accepted on six-week terms by referral.  The program runs from April to September.  
Contact Dvorka Kirasic at 786-2273.<P>
<P>
<H3>WINNIPEG PRENATAL INITIATIVE</H3>
The Winnipeg Prenatal Initiative (PIN) is a flexible resource for low income women, and women with high 
risk pregnancies.  Recently, PIN held a "Food Bingo" to promote healthy nutritional choices during pregnancy.  
Bingo cards were based on food groups, and food was given out for prizes.  A free lunch of soup and bannock 
was served.  FAS information and posters were also on display.  The "Food Bingo" was well received, and plans 
for further drop-in programs are planned.  Call Gayle Wylie at 945-5150 or Donna Weiten at 787-3327 for 
info.<P>

<H3>ACL TAKES POSITION ON FETAL 
ALCOHOL</H3>
The Association for Community Living - Manitoba announced their position statement on FAS.  The paper 
states that FAS/FAE is not curable but is preventable by abstaining from alcohol during the entire nine months of 
pregnancy.  Emphasis is placed on a call for better home, school, and community based services that more 
effectively meet the needs of FAS/FAE individuals, their families, and the professionals working with them.  For 
info, call Dale Kendel at 947-1118.<P>

<H3>MMA announces prevention information package for 
physicians</H3>
<IMG SRC="/fashand.gif" WIDTH=185 HEIGHT=189 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>
The Manitoba Medical Association (MMA) was a key player in launching Manitoba's first Healthy Baby 
Month Campaign.  Dr. Oscar Casiro, Chairman of the Committee on Alcohol and Pregnancy, stated:  
"Physicians can play a crucial role in education leading to healthier lifestyles.  This includes actively 
promoting the best environment for a developing fetus. The MMA wants to explore models of intervention 
for women who are abusing alcohol, or may be at risk. We want to offer physicians some tools for 
identifying these patients and assisting them whenever possible." The MMA has developed a resource 
package to assist physicians in detecting and discussing alcohol issues with patients. The package includes 
a questionnaire for screening/diagnosis and lists referral resources throughout the province. The resource 
package has been distributed to all physicians in Manitoba.  For more information contact the MMA at 
786-7565.<BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
<H3>City Health Department</H3>
The City of Winnipeg's Department of Health provided a five week series on FAS/FAE for public health 
nurses. The series offered a community perspective to issues on women's substance abuse and treatment.  
An "FAS Quiz Board" was created for use in discussing FAS issues with community groups and schools. 
To book the Quiz Board, or for information on FAS, contact Elizabeth Arychuk at 985-5680.<P>
<H3>Fort Alexander Health Centre</H3>
The Fort Alexander Health Centre is addressing the issues of FAS and addiction through the school 
system. Focussing on Grades 7 to 12, teachers provide classroom discussions, poster and pamphlet 
information. A community seminar is being planned. Contact Corrine at 367-2208.<P>
<IMG SRC="/faces.gif" WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=208 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT><H3>Manitoba Liquor Control Commission paper bag

The Manitoba Liquor Control Commission (MLCC) has printed over 300,000 liquor bags for the recent 
Healthy Baby Month with the message "FAS/FAE - A Preventable Birth Defect". The paper bags are 
being used in liquor marts all over the province. Derek Smith, CEO of the Liquor Commission, stated: "It 
is important for the liquor industry to help people make informed choices about alcohol." The MLCC also 
distributes pamphlets on FAS/FAE and displays copies of the MB. FAS NEWS. For information contact

<H2>Native Physicians produce video</H2>
The Native Physicians Association (NPAC) with funding from the Brewers Association of Canada 
have launched a campaign titled "<I>Caring Together</I>".  The campaign focusses on health 
education, healthy pregnancies, and responsible consumption of alcohol.  Dr. Judy Bartlett of 
NPAC explains that "support, strength, spiritual preparation and teachings all play a balanced role 
in a healthy pregnancy.  We are taking a proactive approach to advance and improve the 
community involvement in pregnancies.  When you are pregnant, not drinking at all is one way you 
can care for yourself and your baby - and caring is a responsibility we can all share."  NPAC has 
designed a series of posters and display material which depict a pregnant lady, her family, 
physician, and members of the community joined together.  Over 12,000 posters and 2,000 
displays have been distributed to Band Offices, nursing stations and Friendship Offices.  They 
have also created a 31 minute video following a pregnant woman through her community.  The 
video is broken into sections and comes with a discussion guide to allow it to be used as a teaching 
product.  For more information about the video, contact Dr. Bartlett at 983-4960.<P>

<H1><BR>CAP calls for comprehensive 
prevention campaign to keep babies 
sober</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/fasbaby.gif" WIDTH=226 HEIGHT=313 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10><BR><BR>On March 4th, 1996, The Committee on Alcohol and Pregnancy (CAP) called for public understanding of the 
risks of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects in children whose mothers drink alcohol while 
pregnant, at a press conference at the Manitoba Medical Association.<P>
"<I>Recent studies have shown that children born to mothers who consumed an average one to two drinks 
per day or occasionally up to five drinks at a time, are at increased risk for learning disabilities and other 
cognitive and behavioural problems (Streissguth, 1990; Day, 1994; Jacobson, 1994),"  </I>stated Dr. Oscar 
Casiro, Chairperson, Committee on Alcohol and Pregnancy.  <I>"No safe level of alcohol intake during 
pregnancy has been established (Finnegan &amp  Kandall, 1992) and a recent study from the University of 
Minnesota indicated that the risk of developing leukemia is increased 10 times in children born to women who 
drank alcohol during pregnancy."</I><BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
The Committee stated the following FACTS :<P>
<UL>
<LI>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a pattern of birth defects that results from drinking alcohol during 
pregnancy.  It occurs in one out of every 750 births.
<LI>Children born with FAS may be small in size, have abnormal facial features and brain damage.  
<LI>FAS symptoms are irreversible. Children with FAS never 'catch up' mentally or physically.
<LI>FAS has been called the most common, best known, most preventable cause of mental retardation in 
the western world.
<LI>FAS is totally preventable.  No alcohol = No FAS
<LI>Alcohol in any form is alcohol.  A can of beer, a <BR>
glass of wine/wine cooler and a mixed drink all contain some amount of alcohol.
<LI>Every time a pregnant woman drinks, the alcohol passes through the placenta to the unborn baby.
<LI>Alcohol is more harmful to the fetus than the mother because of the unborn baby's small size and 
rapid <BR>
growth rate.
<LI>There is no 'safe' drinking level.
</UL>
In a more aggressive effort to promote the best possible environment for an unborn child the Committee on 
Alcohol and Pregnancy supports and recommends:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The legislation of warning labels on alcoholic <BR>
beverages
<LI>Senate Bill C-337 to ammend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act
<LI>Changes to CRTC regulations regarding alcohol advertising on television and radio to include 
preclearance by public health agencies
<LI>Changes to CRTC regulation to include a balanced view of issues which in the case of beverage 
alcohol means broadcasting messages about the potential dangers associated with drinking. 
</UL>
" Based on the information available today, the choices are elementary.  One can choose to place an unborn 
child (who has no choice in the matter) at risk <I>for alcohol related birth defects; or one can choose to provide 
the best possible environment for that child. Our advice is to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy,"</I> 
stated Dr. Casiro.<P>
<P>
<H4>Work In Progress</H4>©	A five-day training program for parents is being

<H3>Schools launch FAS awareness program</H3>
Valentine's Day took on special meaning for the students of Edmund Partridge Junior High and Marymound 
School.  It was the kick-off for an FAS awareness program, in which a group of students worked alongside their 
teachers to bring FAS information to their peers.<P>
An FAS poster contest for students in the two schools proved so successful, the committee was inspired to 
coordinate a contest in Manitoba.  In March, schools throughout the province will receive a package of 
information about FAS, with an invitation for students to enter the provincial poster contest.  Submissions on 18" 
X 24" white paper can be hand done using any material other that computer generated images.  Posters will be 
judged for content and originality, and prizes will be awarded. For more information contact:  <BR>

<H3>'Birth to 3 Project' Featured at<BR>
Women  Alcohol  Pregnancy Symposium</H3>
The Committee on Alcohol and Pregnancy was thrilled to invite 'Birth to 3 Years' Project Director, Ms. Therese 
Grant, to Winnipeg as a Visiting Speaker during Healthy Baby Month.  Ms. Grant, PhC, works with the Fetal 
Alcohol and Drug Unit at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, Washington.  She shared her 
knowledge about prevention and intervention strategies for women abusing alcohol in pregnancy - in particular, the 
"Birth to Three" advocacy model.<P>
"<I> The model is novel:  pairing mother and newborn with a paraprofessional advocate who would stand by 
them for three years. These are the years most critical in a child's development,</I>" reported Dr. Oscar Casiro.<P>
The Birth to 3 Project was initiated to develop a system for intervening at delivery with high risk mothers who 
have been abusing alcohol and drugs during pregnancy, have had little or no prenatal care, and are not successfully 
involved with other community agencies.  The intervention involves recruitment at delivery, pairing with an 
advocate/case manager who helps each mother address the problems she perceives as the most pressing, and 
comparing outcome at three years with an untreated comparison group. <P>
" <I>The purpose is ultimately to prevent fetal alcohol and drug effects in our community's children,"</I> said 
Ms. Grant.  " <I>Our aim is to help these children be raised in a healthy environment by their families, and to help 
these mothers resolve alcohol and drug problems and develop healthy productive life styles."</I><P>
Ms. Grant presented formally at the Auditorium of the Faculty of Medicine on March 5th to an audience of 
physicians, students, nurses, social workers, and parents.  Other smaller group sessions took place for field workers, 
agency and government representatives from the Child Special Services, Department of Manitoba Health, the AFM 
and the Interagency FAS/E Clinic.  Local Faculty participating included Dr. Oscar Casiro, Department of Pediatrics 
and Child Health, UofM; Dr. Ab Chudley, Departments of Pediatrics and Child Health and Human Genetics, UofM; 
Dr. Morag Fisher, Women's Treatment, AFM; Dr. Lawrence Hoeschen, Department of Internal Medicine, UofM; Dr. 
Nichole Riese, Graduate Studies, Department of Community Health Sciences.<P>
Dr. Oscar Casiro commented after the sessions: "<I>Now that we've seen a model which exists to teach 
communities how to respond through advocacy and outreach, it is time 
to make such programs available here in Manitoba."</I><P>
The Healthy Baby Month Campaign of the Committee on Alcohol and Pregnancy is grateful for financial support 
from the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba, Manitoba Medical Association, Health Sciences Centre and the 
Interagency FAS/FAE Program 
to enable the Therese Grant Lecture Series. <P>

<H1>ANNOUNCING . . .  HEALTHY 
BABY MONTH<BR>
FEBRUARY 14 to MARCH 15</H1>
The Committee on Alcohol and Pregnancy (CAP) is an interagency committee focussed on 
promoting FAS/FAE initiatives in Manitoba.  As part of a broad awareness strategy on FAS, a 
Healthy Baby Month initiative has been created.  The promotion is targeted for  February 14 - 
March 15, 1996 to encourage organizations and individuals interested in FAS/FAE to become 
involved in a coordinated public awareness campaign.<P>
Many groups throughout the province are volunteering their time and expertise to help raise public 
awareness of FAS/FAE and to make Healthy Baby Month a success.  Representation in various 
communities includes health care workers, schools, youth leaders, physicians and concerned 
citizens.  Individuals or groups are encouraged to get involved in the fight against FAS/FAE.  
Remember . . . Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is 100% preventable if alcohol is not consumed during 
pregnancy.<P>
Some organizations have already developed and organized activities such as:  panel discussions 
and workshops; announcements of planned activities; the development of a series of television 
public service announcements; a poster campaign with prizes; high school essay contests; and 
many other activities.<P>
If you wish to initiate an activity in your community or require further information on FAS/FAE

</I><H1>PSA TO AIR IN NORTHERN 
MANITOBA</H1>
With production of the public service announcements nearing completion, the Committee on 
Alcohol and Pregnancy has taken one step forward in making northern Manitoba residents 
aware of the impact of alcohol on pregnancy.  A focus group was tested, a script developed 
and filming in both English and Cree completed at the Children's Clinic, Health Science Centre 
in September.  Dr Marlyn Cook and Ivan Spence, RN volunteered their time and services to 
deliver the message of the Committee on Alcohol and Pregnancy on film.  Mr Larry Krotz of 
Karante Productions with assistance from Frontier School Division, and the Program 
Development Branch - School Programs Division - Manitoba Education and Training, will edit 
and prepare the material for airing between December 10th and February 14th.<P>

<HR>
On March 12, 1996, the Honourable Clay Serby, Minister Responsible for SGI, 
introduced in the legislature new legislation dealing with drinking and driving, and new 
drivers.<P>
The recommendations in the proposed legislation are based on the Report of the Allparty 
Select Committee on Driving Safety, which was presented in the legislature and received 
all-party consensus on March 16, 1995.<P>
The Select Committee's report followed recommendations made by the Saskatchewan 
Interagency Committee on Impaired Driving in its report <B>A Strategy to Reduce 
Impaired Driving in Saskatchewan</B>. The Interagency Committee included 
representatives from SGI, Saskatchewan Justice, Saskatchewan Highways &amp  
Transportation, Saskatchewan Education, Training &amp  Employment, Saskatchewan 
Health, and the Saskatchewan Liquor &amp  Gaming Authority.<P>
<H2>Background</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The Interagency Committee on Impaired Driving presented its report to government 
in the fall of 1992. In June 1993, the report was released to the public, and government 
asked the Interagency Committee to consult with the public on its recommendations. In 
July and August 1993, twenty-two public meeting were held across Saskatchewan. Over 
8,000 copies of the report and a questionnaire were distributed to the public and to groups 
with an interest in drinking and driving. Over 900 questionnaires were returned. A question 
on blood alcohol content (BAC) was included in an omnibus telephone survey in August 
1993, in which 989 individuals were polled.
<LI>Consultations were held with youth in February and March, 1994 on the issue of a 
lower BAC for new drivers. Over 2,200 youth provided their input on is topic through 
school meetings and questionnaires.
<LI>In October of 1994, the Select Committee on Driving Safety, an all-party committee 
of the legislature, was formed and given a mandate to consider and report on safe driving 
practices and driving without impairment.
<LI>The Select Committee held sixteen public hearings and nineteen school visits 
throughout the province, as well as receiving written submissions. The committee 
distributed questionnaires to 2,500 stakeholders and over 6,800 questionnaires were 
returned.

drivers?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>the probationary period will be two years from the date they validate their first 
driver's licence, regardless of class (other than a learner's licence).
<LI>licensing actions (restrictions, suspension, revocation) may result based on 
convictions and accidents.

No fines, convictions or criminal charges will result from a violation of the .04 
requirement unless the driver is over .08 or is considered impaired by the police officer 
and a conviction results.<P>
Note: Under the Criminal Code, a driver can be charged with "Impaired Driving" even 
with a BAC under .08. Hence, a new driver who has a BAC: between .04 and .08 could 
still be charged under the Criminal Code for impaired driving.<P>
<H3>Drinking &amp  Driving Initiatives</H3>
<H4>1.  Under the new drinking and driving countermeasures, 
what will happen to someone who is convicted of having a BAC

<LI>the driver will also be required to undergo an addictions screening and complete the

<H4>2.  Are there any restricted licence or early reinstatement 
options?</H4>
<B>Restricted licence option:</B><BR><B>
</B>Individuals with a 1st, 2nd or 3rd offence who have served less than 50% of their 
statutory suspension, but have completed an addictions screening and the prescribed 
education or recovery program, may apply to the Highway Traffic Board for a restricted 
licence.<P>
The driver must prove to the board; <P>
<UL>
<LI>the absence of any driving privileges would cause them extreme hardship;
<LI>the granting of a restricted licence would not l)e contrary to the public interest.
</UL>
<B>Provisional licence option</B>: <BR>
Individuals with a 1st, 2nd or 3rd offence who have served 50% of their statutory 
suspension, and have completed an addictions screening and the prescribed education or 
recovery program, are eligible for a provisional licence. The provisional licence holder will 
have their original suspension term reinstated if they violate the .04% BAC. <P>
Note: Individuals with a 4th or subsequent suspension are not eligible for early 
reinstatement options, but must complete all addictions screening and the prescribed 
education or recovery program prior to licence reinstatement.<P>
<H4>3.  Can someone who is currently suspended get their licence 
back early?</H4>
Yes, everyone who is currently suspended will be eligible for the new program providing 
they undergo screening and prescribed education or recovery program. Letters will be sent 
to all drivers who are currently suspended to advise them of the new program and their 
options.<P>
Note: Drivers who are currently suspended for a fourth or subsequent offence will be 
given a one time option to participate in the program.<P>
<H4>4.  Will the new drinking and driving laws affect someone 
who is charged with drinking and driving before the new laws 
become effective?</H4>
The laws will apply to convictions for criminal code, failing to stop and driving while 
disqualified which occur after the effective date of the new legislation. A person who is 
charged before the new legislation comes into effect, but is convicted after will also be 
subject to new laws. <P>
<H4>8.  Why wasn't the .04 BAC requirement made a conviction 
that would result in charges or fines?</H4>
The legal BAC is set out in the Criminal Code, which is federal law and cannot be changed 
by provincial legislation. Therefore, the .04 BAC for drivers was established as a 
provincial provision.<P>
The .04 provision is intended to be preventive and encourage formation of the right habits 
in drivers, rather than punitive.<P>
<H3>Vehicle Impoundment</H3>
<H4>1.  Will a person who is stopped for drinking and driving 
have their vehicle impounded?</H4>
No, the impoundment provision relates to individuals who drive while disqualified or 
suspended, or without a driver's licence. Impoundment will not result after being stopped 
for drinking and driving, unless the person is also driving while disqualified.<P>
Persons caught driving while disqualified will have the vehicle they are driving impounded 
for 30 days. A second or subsequent occurrence of driving while disqualified will result in 
a 60 day vehicle impoundment. <P>
<H4>2.  Vehicle impoundment will occur when a person is caught 
driving while disqualified. Does this include all kinds of licence 
suspensions?</H4>
Vehicle impoundment will occur when a person is caught driving while disqualified due 
to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>a Criminal Code offence;
<LI>an administrative suspension (with some exceptions, listed below);
<LI>the driver has completed a suspension period and has not renewed his license,
<LI>the driver has a previous conviction of driving without a licence in the last 5 years 
and currently has no valid licence.
</UL>
Does not include suspensions resulting from the following:<P>
Consent and undertaking; (Money owed to SGI as a result of an accident where the driver 
was responsible for the accident but did not have insurance cover (i.e. impaired driver)<P>
<UL>
<LI>NSF cheque;
<LI>delinquent driver points;
<LI>refusal to renew due to unpaid fines.
</UL>
<H4>3.  What if the disqualified driver is operating a vehicle that 
does not belong to them?</H4>
The vehicle the disqualified driver is operating will be impounded, regardless of who the 
owner is. However, the owner of the vehicle can apply for early release of the vehicle.<P>
The criteria for early release are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the vehicle was reported stolen; 
<LI>the owner could not have reasonably known the driver was disqualified; 
<LI>the driver could not have reasonably known of their disqualification; 
<LI>continued impoundment would pose serious threat to the health of any person; 
<LI>extreme hardship for person(s) other than the driver; 
<LI>the 60 day impoundment term should have been 30 days.
</UL>
If the vehicle is released early for grounds 2 or 3, the vehicle's licence plate may be zebra 
striped. If released on grounds 4 or 5, zebra striping is mandatory.<P>
Zebra striping is a sticker placed on the licence plate of a vehicle released early from 
impoundment. It serves as an indicator to law enforcement that the vehicle was driven by a 
disqualified driver, and gives police the authority to stop the vehicle and check if the driver 
has a valid driver's licence.<P>
<H4>4.  Where will vehicle be impounded?</H4>
The vehicle will be impounded at the nearest approved garage to where the vehicle was 
stopped. The enforcement officer can issue a Notice of Seizure and Direction when there 
is an authorized driver to transport the vehicle to a specific location before a specific 
time.<P>
<H4>5.  Is there a cost for impoundment?</H4>
Yes, the vehicle owner is required to pay towing and storage costs to the garage keeper, 
as well as a release administration fee.<P>
<H4>6.  What happens if the impounded vehicle is not 
claimed?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>15 days after the end of the impoundment term, the garage keeper can apply to the 
administrator to transfer the ownership of the vehicle to the garage keeper's name.
<LI>the garage keeper may then dispose of the vehicle to cover the costs of towing and 
storage.
<LI>if there are any outstanding costs, the licence plates (if any) will be canceled and 
applied to the amount owing. Any- excess will be returned to the vehicle owner.
<LI>if SGI is required to cover any of the costs, the amount paid out will be applied as n 
receivable on the vehicle owners file. Person's who owe money to SGI cannot register a 
vehicle or obtain a drivers licence until the money <I>is </I>paid.
</UL>
<H4>7.  Can the licence plates of an impounded vehicle be 
transferred to another vehicle?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>No, the licence plates on an impounded vehicle cannot be transferred or canceled. 
</UL>
<H3>General</H3>
<H4>1.  How will these initiatives improve the drinking and 
driving problem in Saskatchewan?</H4>
There are two primary targets for the strategy over 5 years;<P>
<UL>
<LI>a 20% reduction in deaths on Saskatchewan roadways attributed to alcohol;
<LI>a 20% reduction in the incidence of impaired driving in Saskatchewan
</UL>
<H4>2.  Are there new programs overly complicated?</H4>
The Interagency Implementation Steering Committee has taken great pains to simplify the 
programs for the users. The programs are computerized wherever possible to simplify and 
reduce errors.<P>
<H4>3.  When is SGI implementing the medical program 
change?</H4>
We are moving as quickly as we can to implement this change. SGI has consulted with the 
medical community on the legislation itself and now that it has been introduced, will begin 
consultation and negotiation on the details of the program, such as the fee structure.<P>
<H4>4.  Is the government moving to a single licence plate?</H4>
This legislation simply moves the rules concerning licence plate into regulations to 
facilitate change, should a decision be made to go to single plates. A decision has not yet 
been made. In 1996, SGI will look at the costs of various alternatives and will work with 
law enforcement agencies to address any concerns they may have. <P>

</HEAD><BODY><FONT COLOR=FF00FF><H1>Problem Gambling Across Canada</H1>
<HR></FONT>
The last several years have seen increased prevalence of various gambling activities in Canada.  
A consequence of this increase is a significant increase in the number of individuals experiencing 
problems.  Most jurisdictions in this country have begun to give greater attention to studying and 
addressing these problems.  A number of groups, including gaming commissions, university 
researchers and provincial health departments are beginning to work together to coordinate a 
response.<P>
To support networking and communication amongst those groups across the country, the 
CCSA is presenting a snapshot of gambling issues and activities in a number of Canadian 
jurisdictions.  For further information, contact Gary Roberts (<A HREF="mailto:groberts@ccsa.ca">groberts@ccsa.ca</A> or 613-235-

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
The North American Think Tank on Youth Gambling Issues was convened April 6-8, 1995 at Harvard 
Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. Co-sponsored by the Harvard Medical School, Division on 
Addictions, and the Minnesota Council on Compulsive Gambling, with assistance from the Massachusetts 
Council on Compulsive Gambling, the event brought together key leaders from throughout the United 
States and Canada who represented diverse fields including government, education, the gambling industry, 
finance, law enforcement, the judiciary, health care and research.<P>
The purpose of the North American Think Tank was to develop a blueprint for responsible public policy to 
address the issues associated with youth gambling. It was intended to remain gambling neutral, neither 
supporting nor opposing gambling. The event was funded by donations from private business and tribal 
governments.<P>
The Think Tank process was a highly structured and tightly managed format incorporating both small and 
large group discussion as well as presentations by various experts on the topic of gambling and youth.<P>
<H2>Recommendations</H2>
North American Think Tank participants developed recommendations in seven key areas of concern. They 
are:<P>
<H3>Policy development recommendations</H3>
The U.S. and Canada create a binational task force to coordinate the development of a North American 
response to youth gambling and solicit the funds necessary to pay for needed programs.<P>
<H3>Funding recommendations</H3>
The task force be structured as a not-for-profit organization to attract funding from public and private sector 
sources.<P>
<H3>Law enforcement recommendations</H3>
The gambling industry establish industry standards for enforcement of underage gambling prohibitions, 
support tougher penalties against vendors who fail to enforce legal gambling age limits, and aggressively 
promote policies that prohibit payment of prizes to minors gambling illegally.<P>
<H3>Research recommendations</H3>
An international research effort be undertaken to determine the prevalence of youth gambling and the 
effectiveness of prevention and treatment programs, findings to be disseminated via an electronic 
"information superhighway" through a national or international clearinghouse.<P>
<H3>Treatment and training recommendations</H3>
Treatment methods in North America be inventoried and evaluated for clinical efficacy, and that 
professional training for youth gambling treatment providers be tailored to meet training needs.<P>
<H3>Education recommendations</H3>
Curriculums and programs be developed to educate children, parents and teachers about the issue of youth 
gambling.<P>
<H3>Public awareness and media recommendations</H3>
The public and policy makers be educated about youth gambling through the media and various other 
strategies, and that the gambling industry develop and promote a voluntary standards program to 
discourage the targeting of gambling advertising to young consumers.<P>
Participants recommended that an interim task force be established to draft a plan for establishment of a 
permanent binational organization. The Harvard Medical School, Division on Addictions, and the 
Minnesota Council on Compulsive Gambling were asked to serve as convenors of that interim task force. 
With the completion of this final report, that process is ready to begin.<P>
It should be emphasized that the North American Think Tank was only the first step in what must be a long-
term effort to respond to the issue of youth gambling. While additional approaches may surface, or details 
of implementation may change, Think Tank participants, with this report, have helped to create an outline a 
blueprint - from which to proceed.<P>

Benefit Problem Gamblers</H1>

<HR>November 8, 1995
HALIFAX-The Department of Health announced today plans to enhance its province-wide prevention and 
treatment programs for problem gambling.<P>
"We are now in the position to implement more comprehensive programs to help Nova Scotians with 
gambling problems," said Health Minister Ron Stowart.<P>
The introduction of video lottery terminals brought attention to the issue of problem gambling in Nova 
Scotia. Acknowledging gambling's increasing popularity, the province mandated Drug Dependency 
Services to provide treatment for problem gamblers and their families. In 1993, a budget of $462,500 was 
set aside for treatment for the first time. Video lottery terminals are still the most common outlet.<P>
It is estimated the new treatment programs will benefit approximately 4,000 to 8,000 people with 
gambling problems, including their families.<P>
The enhanced provincial treatment program for problem gamblers will feature a toll-free 1-800 telephone 
number staffed by professional counsellors 24 hours a day. It will offer confidential counselling and 
information on problem gambling. It will also provide a direct referral to treatment programs and to 
Gamblers Anonymous groups. Prevention and education programs will generate widespread awareness of 
problem gambling to help increase the support network available for people needing assistance. Research 
programs will try to determine the causes of problem gambling, who it affects and how it can be 
prevented. The Department of Health will also work with the Department of Education and Culture to 
include prevention programs in the curriculum at schools.<P>
"The majority of Nova Scotians will never develop a problem with gambling," said Dr. Stewart. 
"However, we do want to emphasize prevention and educational programs to reduce the risk of people 
developing problem gambling in the province, while at the same time offering quality treatment for people 
who currently need assistance."<P>
The Department of Health is injecting $1.2 million of new money into the prevention and treatment of 
problem gambling in Nova Scotia. This money is in addition to the $462,500 spent annually in this area. 
The new funding will come from revenues generated by casino operations and video lottery terminals.<P>
Funding for prevention and treatment programs in other provinces ranges from $400,000 in Quebec to 
$l.5 million in Saskatchewan.<P>
The new funding from casino operations and the video lottery terminals will be allocated as follows: 
$460,000 will be spent on prevention/education/information; $665,000 for treatment; and $250,000 on 
research and evaluation. The previously allocated money, totaling $462,500, will be spent on treatment 
services. The department will oversee the development of the programs. They will be implemented by the 
private and not-for-profit sectors.<P>
In developing the newly strengthened program, The Department of Health consulted with many groups 
including: Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation, Nova Scotia Gaming Control Commission, the Department 
of Education, members of Gamblers Anonymous, Canadian Foundation on Compulsive Gambling, 
National Council on Problem Gambling (US) and the Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission.<P>

Most people who gamble never develop a problem. But for those who need help, treatment is available in 
Nova Scotia.<P>
Treatment is based on an assessment by therapists employed by the Department of Health's Drug 
Dependency Services. A typical treatment plan identifies key issues in a client's lifestyle and helps the 
client to develop coping mechanisms to address problems.<P>
Family involvement is also encouraged, Often families receive treatment to help them cope.<P>
Clients treated by Drug Dependency come from all parts of Nova Scotia. They are served through a 
community network as well as regional Drug Dependency offices. Clients come from all walks of of 
life,<P>
The substantial new funding for the prevention and treatment of problem gambling will be directed to 
several areas including youth, community action and public awareness.<P>
Education programs directed at youth will help them to avoid the behaviours that lead to problem 
gambling. Problem gambling will be added as an issue to school curriculums, in much the same way as 
substance abuse and cigarette smoking are discussed today.<P>
Since more needs to be learned about problem gambling, funds will be allocated for research and 
evaluation.<P>

<H1>Albertans Present Views on Lotteries 
and Gaming Reform</H1>
<HR>
Edmonton -- The Lotteries Review Committee today released their report, <B>New 
Directions for Lotteries and Gaming. </B>The report is a result of ten months of extensive 
review and contains 45 recommendations to set a new direction for lotteries and gaming in 
Alberta.<P>
"This report echoes the views of thousands of Albertans who participated in the consultation 
process," said Committee Chair Judy Gordon, MLA (Lacombe-Stettler). Overall, the report 
recommends a fundamental change in the way lotteries and gaming operation in Alberta, while 
removing unnecessary restrictions on legitimate gambling and gaming activities. Through these 
recommendations we have strived to maintain a well-regulated and streamlined system, to return 
substantial benefits to communities, to respond to serious concerns with VLTs, and to ensure 
that lotteries revenues continue to be used for the benefit of Albertans."<P>
"I recognize the efforts of the Committee members in reevaluating the present system of lotteries 
and gaming in Alberta. It has been a tremendous task and I would like to thank the Committee 
for their report and recommendations on these important issues," said Dr. Stephen C. West, 
Minister responsible for Lotteries and Gaming. "Consultations such as this form an integral part 
of the government decision-making process."<P>
The broad range of recommendations include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>communities should share directly in VLT and lottery revenue and would have a direct role in deciding 
how lottery funds will be used to meet local needs and local priorities.
<LI>establishing a new Provincial Lotteries Foundation to streamline administration and maintain a high 
priority on lottery support for arts and culture, sports and recreation, enrichment programs in education, 
health and wellness and historical resources.
<LI>establishing a new endowment fund for expanding technology in health and education would bring 
direct benefits to students and to all Albertans.
<LI>a substantial portion of lottery revenues should benefit not only current Albertans, but generations to 
come through paying down Alberta's debt.
<LI>the number of VLTs in bars and lounges should be capped, with surplus machines reallocated to reduce 
the backlog of current applications, and moved to charitable casinos where they would become a source of 
revenues for charitable groups and organizations.
<LI>communities should be able to decide by plebiscite if they want to prohibit VLTs in their community 
and government would honour the outcome of the vote.
<LI>problem gambling should be a first providing a solid research base and effective treatment programs for 
those who need them.
<LI>casinos in Alberta must be government regulated and retain their non-profit status.
<LI>charitable organizations should have increased access to casino licences in Edmonton and Calgary; 
casino hours should be extended and revenues pooled over a three month period.
</UL>
The Lotteries Review Committee, established by Premier Ralph Klein in October 1994, was 
charged with the task of consulting with Albertans about future directions for lotteries and 
gaming. Through public consultation that commenced in January 1995, a total of 22 public 
meetings were held in 14 locations across the province, with over 2,200 Albertans in 
attendance. The Committee heard 462 oral presentations and received over 18,500 written 
responses in the form of letters, discussion papers, and petitions. The Committee's review 
focused on seven key issues:<P>
<UL>
<LI>What should lotteries be used for? 
<LI>Are there better ways of allocating lottery revenues? 
<LI>How can we improve accountability? 
<LI>What is the impact of VLTs on community organizations? 
<LI>How should casinos operate? 
<LI>How do we address problem gambling? 
<LI>Should lottery funding go to support professional sports teams?
</UL>
"I would like to thank the thousands of Albertans who participated in the review and provided 
valuable advice and insight," added Mrs. Gordon. "This input is an integral part of the new 
direction for lotteries and gaming in Alberta. Together, the Committee members feel that these 
new directions will maintain Alberta' s strong reputation for having a well-regulated gaming 
industry and also ensure that lottery funds are used to fulfill their original purpose -- to enrich the 
quality of life for Albertans,"<P>

Directions for Lotteries and Gaming, </B>are available through local MLA constituency

</HEAD><BODY>
<H4>CCSA comments to the Canadian Radio Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on proposed revisions to the regulatory framework governing the broadcast of 
alcohol beverage advertising</H4>
<HR>
November 16, 1995<P>
Mr. Allan J. Darling<BR>
Secretary General<BR>
CRTC<BR>
Ottawa ON<BR>
K1A 0N2<P>
<I>Re: Public Notice CRTC 1995-142</I><P>
Dear Mr. Darling:<P>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse is pleased to respond to the CRTC's request for comment on 
proposed revisions to the regulatory framework governing the broadcast of alcoholic beverage advertising. 
The CCSA is a semi-autonomous agency, created by Parliament in 1988, which operates with funding from 
Canada's Drug Strategy and revenues generated through its own initiatives. It has a broad mandate to 
promote awareness of the harms associated with substance abuse, and to stimulate the participation of 
Canadians in reducing or eliminating those harms. The brief comments that follow are informed by our 
understanding of alcohol-related problems and the many countermeasures used to try to mitigate those 
effects. We claim no expertise in the area of broadcast regulation and will confine our remarks to statements 
of general principle.<P>
We believe the cumulative effect of repeated exposure to beverage alcohol advertising is to create a climate 
of acceptability around drinking, particularly among young people, and that this leads ultimately to 
increased consumption, and attendant health and social problems. We consider this to be an intuitive truth, 
but it is also supported by some recent scientific evidence which we would be pleased to make available to 
you. Viewed in this light, the increased exposure to beverage alcohol advertising that could result from new 
players entering the field--distillers and  retailers, for example--is naturally of deep concern to us. We 
strongly believe that rules now in place to regulate the broadcast advertising of beverage alcohol should 
not in any way be dismantled, and that in fact such measures should be extended and strengthened.<P>
Our first recommendation, therefore, is that the pre-clearance of broadcast advertising must continue. We 
recognize the desire of the CRTC to assign this responsibility to the Canadian Advertising Foundation. We 
support this delegation of authority, if and to the extent that public health agencies are given a strong voice 
in the pre-clearance process. With due respect, the CAF's experience in pre-clearing food advertising does 
not fully qualify it to deal with the complex interaction between beverage alcohol and society. Further, we 
strongly urge that the CRTC retain ultimate responsibility for enforcing the excellent advertising code it has 
produced (Public Notice, Appendix A), and as a way of underscoring this responsibility, we propose that 
the CRTC meet with beverage alcohol advertisers once a year to review the content of their advertisements 
and their educational messages.<P>
We are impressed by the quality of some educational messages produced by the beverage alcohol industry 
and we would like to see these continue. Based on the conservative assessment that the negative economic 
consequences accruing from beverage alcohol are at least equal to the benefits to Canadians, an argument 
could be made for dedicating as much time and money to these types of messages as to commercial 
inducements, particularly at a time when governments are cutting back on countermeasure expenditures. We 
accept that a 50/50 ratio may be impractical, and that generally a spending level of at least 10-15 per cent of 
the overall beverage alcohol advertising budget is the norm. We endorse this ratio to the extent that the 
industry continues to demonstrate increased social responsibility through investment not only in 
preventing alcohol misuse, but in mitigating the consequences of that misuse.<P>
 We hesitate to demand that certain sectors of the beverage alcohol industry pour more money into 
countermeasure advertising because we fear that these additional amounts will be siphoned away from other 
worthwhile initiatives supported by the industry in the areas of secondary and tertiary prevention. More 
educational messages will not take the place of these important activities which we would like to see 
increased. We are left, then, with the hope that more air time might be freed up by broadcasters for existing 
educational messages in exchange for some form of regulatory "carrot" that might help compensate 
broadcasters for revenue losses.<P>
Although some sectors of the industry have already invested a considerable amount in educational 
messages, we are concerned about potential newcomers to broadcast advertising, such as distillers and 
retailers. They should be expected to produce or sponsor a significant portion of educational messages 
about the harms associated with the products they sell. Obviously some of the new players will not have the 
resources necessary to produce and air high quality educational messages, but this cannot be seen as an 
argument for exempting them from the requirements. These potential advertisers should be advised to seek 
the help of public health agencies in identifying existing educational resources, and they should be 
encouraged to negotiate with broadcasters to achieve the required ratio of countermeasure advertising.  
Here again our support of a ratio of at least 10-15 per cent is contingent upon advertisers investing in a 
broad spectrum of measures aimed at preventing alcohol misuse and mitigating the consequences of that 
misuse.<P>
A final point about educational messages: The CRTC must spell out clearly in its regulations and guidelines 
not only the amount of air time required, but also the hours during which messages must be broadcast. It is 
self-evident that a balanced view of beverage alcohol will not be achieved if commercial inducements are 
aired in prime time and countermeasure messages are shown at three o'clock in the morning.<P>
We are keenly aware that to some extent we are simply suggesting a re-arrangement of deckchairs on the 
Titanic. With the huge US market to the south of us and the ready access by Canadians to dozens, if not 
hundreds of broadcast channels from around the world carrying endless advertisements for beverage 
alcohol, there appears to be little we can do to present a balanced view of drinking in our society. For this 
reason, we suggest the CRTC consider initiating discussions with its counterpart organizations in the US 
and overseas with the objective of developing an international code of beverage alcohol advertising. Such a 
code would fit comfortably within the framework of ISO 9000 which was established as a set of  generic 
guidelines for ensuring that products and services meet the needs of consumers.<P>
If you would like more information on the ISO 9000 protocols or on any of the other issues I have raised in 
this letter, please do not hesitate to contact me. The CRTC has a difficult task ahead of it as it seeks to 
balance a number of divergent interests. Our view is that through the good will and cooperation of all 
concerned, that balance can be achieved.<P>
Sincerely,<P>
<P>

<H2><A NAME = reducing></A>Reducing 
Problems Through Municipal Alcohol Policies:  
The Canadian Experiment in Ontario</H2>
Toronto, October 2, 1995 --- Municipalities that have a formal alcohol policy experience 
fewer alcohol related problems, such as under age drinking, fighting and vandalism. This is 
one of the findings in a study released by the Addiction Research Foundation (ARF).<P>
The study, <B>Reducing Problems Through Municipal Alcohol Policies:  The 
Canadian Experiment in Ontario</B>, is part of an ongoing effort to evaluate the 
effectiveness of municipal alcohol policies (MAPs) in reducing alcohol problems in 
municipally-owned or managed facilities. These facilities include: arenas, community 
centres and halls, senior centres, parks, beaches, stadiums, and sports fields, where alcohol 
may be served at specially licensed events.<P>
The study, which was based on information received from 477 Ontario municipalities 
between October 1994 and January l 99S, found that about two-thirds of them did not 
have a formal policy governing alcohol use in their facilities. One hundred and seven 
municipalities (22.4 per cent) had a formal written policy and 55 ( 11.5 per cent) were 
developing one.<P>
On average, it took communities about 10 months to develop a policy and 46.7 per cent of 
those with a policy had had it in place for a year or less. The increase in the number of 
policies that have been recently developed is the result of efforts by public health units and 
the ARF, and an increase in municipal awareness and receptivity to these initiatives.<P>
The study also found that it took longer for larger communities to develop a policy. The 
reasons for this include: a large number of public facilities, a large bureaucracy, the need 
to consult with several stakeholders and to accommodate the ethnic diversity of the 
community.<P>
Municipal officials indicated that they had developed a formal written policy for a variety 
of reasons, including safety, the fear of possible liability and because it was recommended 
by recreation staff. Of the municipalities that had a formal policy, 48.6 per cent of them 
experienced no decline in the number of requests to rent their facilities.<P>
In the early l 990s, the ARF and local public health units helped develop MAPs across 
Ontario. During this time, communities were encouraged to: prepare a list of facilities at 
which alcohol can and cannot be served, set restrictions on serving patrons to intoxication, 
provide rides home for the intoxicated, enforce rules against serving alcohol to under age 
participants, and require low alcohol-content drinks and food to be made available.<P>
ARF's evaluation of the effectiveness of MAPs will also include a controlled and more 
detailed study of the process and effects of introducing a MAP in selected communities. 
The main results of this study will be available in the fall of l997.<P>

<H2><A NAME = tobacco></A>News Release 
from the Addiction Research Foundation:  
Tobacco Advertising </H2>
The Supreme Court of Canada's decision to strike down the federal law banning tobacco 
advertising is a giant step backwards, said Dr. Perry Kendall, president of the Addiction 
Research Foundation (ARF).<P>
"Over 40,000 Canadians die each year from tobacco-related causes such as cancer, 
emphysema and heart disease. That's three times the number of people who die from 
alcohol, illicit drugs, car accidents, suicide, murder and AIDS combined," said 
Kendall.<P>
"The most effective strategy for reducing these numbers is a coordinated one made up of 
taxation, legislation, enforcement, health promotion and prevention initiatives. 
Unfortunately today, an important cornerstone was dismantled," added Kendall.<P>
"Today's Supreme Court ruling and the federal government's decision last year to lower 
the tax on cigarettes will increase the number of smokers in Ontario. And every rise in 
tobacco consumption raises the social costs of tobacco use, including the high economic 
costs and the toll in terms of pain, suffering and death," said Kendall. Tobacco-related 
illness costs the Canadian government about $9.5 billion a year.<P>
"In the last few years, research has shown that nicotine is an addictive drug. As a result, 
new regulations for tobacco products are needed. The government must classify cigarettes 
as a drug, which will help reduce the harmful effects of tobacco use, especially among 
children and youth," said Kendall.<P>

<CENTER><H1>Tromsø College</H1>
<H2>Department of Health Care Sciences</H2></CENTER>
<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
On 29 May 1990 the Board of Colleges in the county of Troms appointed a committee to work out a proposal 
for a one-year diploma course in substance-related problems.<P>
The committee submitted its report on 30 June 1991.<P>
Since 1 January 1993, Tromsø College, Department of Health Care Sciences, has been responsible for further 
development.<P>
The curriculum is largely in line with the committee's proposals, and will in our opinion serve as a useful 
model for organising a course of study with strong multiprofessional objectives.<P>
Consequently, the course should be open to several occupational groups.  This can be achieved through 
flexibility in the construction of the programme and admission procedures, without lowering the academic 
level.<P>
The diploma course is not intended as a specialisation for certain definite categories of the many 
professions working in the field of alcohol and drug abuse.  Problem identification and early intervention are 
emphasised rather than traditional treatment in institutions, which is dealt with only under Areas of 
concentration in course IV (see below).  <P>
The course will focus on particular problems in North Norway.<P>
<H5>Main objectives</H5>
The course has three main objectives:<P>
<OL>
<LI>contribute to build up a <B>common knowledge base</B> to provide a basis for increased 
interdisciplinary effort in dealing with substance-related problems 
<LI>develop a holistic approach and ability to co-operate
<LI>develop <B>competence</B> to identify, evaluate and implement adequate measures against the 
various manifestations of substance abuse
</OL>
<H4>Target group and admission requirements  </H4>
The diploma course is primarily designed for students who have already completed three-year programmes 
in the fields of health care, social welfare, education or relevant university studies.<P>
Applicants lacking the necessary qualifications for meeting the requirements mentioned above, may be 
admitted on the basis of a separate evaluation.  This quota should not exceed 10 % of the total number of 
students.<P>
Applicants who can document a background from recognised and comprehensive up-grading courses, may 
apply for permission to complete the course in a shorter period of time.<P>
<H4>General framework and duration</H4>
The diploma course comprises four courses each carrying 5 credits, with a total of 20 credits, which is a 
normal workload per year at Norwegian colleges and universities.  The programme is offered on a part-time 
basis over two years with 5 credits per semester.<P>
The four courses are:<P>
I  : Introductory course - 5 credits<P>
II : Individual effects and measures - 5 credits<P>
III: Community-based measures and legal aspects - 5 credits<P>
IV: Areas of  concentration - 5 credits<P>
It will be possible to leave the programme after completion of 10 credits.  <P>
A 10-credit unit may consist of either courses I+II or I+III, while the remaining courses may be taken at a 
later time to complete the 20-credit programme.  The area of concentration (IV) should always be studied 
last.   <P>
Units carrying less than 10 credits cannot be used as elements in a cand. mag. degree, and will not be 
recognised as independent units of continuing education.<P>
<H4>Examination/grading system</H4>
<B>1) Criteria for passing courses I+II (or I+III) - 10 credits</B><P>
After completion of the second course a report on an approved theme is to be submitted.<P>
The report should cover about 10 typewritten pages (A4) and will be assessed according to a grade scale 
from 1-6, including half grade points, where 1.0 is the best and 4.0 the lowest pass grade.<P>
The paper may be worked out by a group of maximum 3 students, in which case 20 typewritten pages (A4) 
are required.<P>
<B>2) Criteria for passing courses III+IV (or II+IV) - 10 credits</B><P>
Individual, written project report related to the area of concentration chosen.<P>
The report should cover about 20 typewritten pages (A4), and will be given a numerical grade as under 
1).<P>
The grade will be subject to adjustment in an oral examination.<P>
The topics/questions for the papers are to be given/approved 1 month prior to submission date.<P>
<H4>Instruction and course work</H4>
The strong emphasis placed on an interdisciplinary, holistic approach and practical training evident both in 
the objectives and design of the programme, should also be reflected in teaching methods and didactics.<P>
The methodical basic units will be made up of multi-professional groups, and the course work will largely be 
based on current issues related to alcohol and drug abuse.<P>
Consequently problem-oriented learning will constitute the natural pedagogical basis on which the work is 
to be organised.<P>
For this purpose the course descriptions are formulated so as to function as an aid for students in the 
learning process:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the objectives serve as guidelines for important problem areas  
<LI>the descriptions are given in detail to help students in their independent work and preparation of 
papers
</UL>
The aim of the course is to provide students with a basis for their activities in which knowledge, skills and 
attitudes are integrated.<P>
This will be achieved through interaction between theoretical studies and  practical experience.<P>
In order to stimulate learning by experience, practical work will be emphasised.  Possibly this will be carried 
out at the places where the students are employed.<P>
In addition, instruction will be given in the form of case work, group work, role play, project work, lectures 
and independent study. <P>
In order to provide a possibility for differentiation, students from the various professions will in connection 
with each topic studied, be given an opportunity to concentrate on problems related to their particular fields 
(areas of concentration, parts of law and topics related to specific subjects).<P>
<H4>Reading lists</H4>
A total of about 3,600 pages are required, of which approximately 1,200 pages constitute the common core 
material.  The rest is spread over resource lists where the students chose approximately 1,200 pages in 
connection with papers related to problem-oriented learning, and approximately 1,200 pages independently 
chosen literature for project work and the areas of concentration. <P>
All reading material is subject to course leader's approval.<P>

The <B>1996 PEI Student Drug Use Survey</B> is part of a coordinated Atlantic Canada initiative, using a standard protocol. The surveys in PEI, NS, NB, and Nfld are providing comparable information throughout the region for the first time.<P>
In total, 3062 randomly sampled PEI students in grades 7, 9, 10, and 12 completed the survey in April, 1996. <B>This report provides the best estimates currently available to describe the size of drug-use in the adolescent PEI student population</B>. All 
percentages in this report are likely to be under-estimated, since under-reporting is a larger
problem for self-report surveys than over-reporting.<P>
The drugs most commonly used by adolescent students in PEI are alcohol, tobacco, and 
cannabis.<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Alcohol</B> is the drug of choice, with over half of adolescent students reporting its 
use in the past year. This rate is similar in the other Atlantic provinces. Drinking rates climb from 
19% of Grade 7 students to 73% of Grade 12 students. Peer pressure plays a very large role in 
student alcohol use. If half or more of their friends drink alcohol, 80% of students also drink.
<LI>About one in three students smoked <B>cigarettes</B> in the past year. This rate is 
similar in the other Atlantic provinces. In Grade 7, one in four students smoke and by Grades 
10 and 12 more than half the students smoke. Girls are smoking more than boys in all grades. 
Across all grades 1 in 6 smokers has tried to quit. Peer pressure has less influence on student 
smoking compared to drinking. If half or more of their friends smoke, 43% of students also 
smoke.
<B><LI>Cannabis</B> use in the past year was reported by about one in four students in 
PEI and Nfld, compared to about one in three students in NS and NB In PEI, the other Atlantic 
Provinces, and Ontario, cannabis use has doubled over the past 5 years. Rates of use in PEI 
climb from 5% of Grade 7 students to 37% of Grade 12 students. Peer pressure plays a very 
large role, similar to alcohol. If half or more of their friends use cannabis, 80% of students also 
use cannabis.
<LI>The most popular <B>hallucinogen</B> in PEI is Magic Mushrooms, followed by LSD. 
This pattern is similar in Nfld, but reversed in NS and NB In PEI, rates of use for both drugs 
climb from 3% in Grade 7 to 13% in Grade 12.
<LI>From 5% to 9% of Atlantic students report using <B>inhalants, stimulants, and 
tranquilizers</B>. The remaining drugs are reported by less than 5% of adolescent students. 
Proportions are generally similar in all four provinces.
<LI>Many students are unaware of the <B>consequences</B> of alcohol and drug use. 
Compared to alcohol users, DRUG USERS are more likely to drive a car while under the 
influence, have less money to buy other things, disagree with family or friends, and affect school work. However, compared to drug users, ALCOHOL USERS are more likely to be in trouble 
with police, cause injury to themselves or cause damage.
<LI>The most common behaviour of concern with alcohol and drug use is 
<B>unplanned</B> sex. Across all grades, of the students who have had sex, HALF report 
unplanned sex while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The rates of sexual activity climb 
from 8% of Grade 7 students to 53% of Grade 12 students.
<LI>Although small numbers of alcohol and drug users seek <B>help</B>, many of their 
friends are asking for help. Many students want to help their peers, but do not know how.
<LI>The most common forms of <B>gambling</B> are cards, lotteries, and sport activities, 
with about one in three students reporting gambling.
<LI>Student's recommendations for <B>drug education</B> followed three themes: start 
early, provide more information on consequences and how to help peers, and use real victims instead of stories.
<LI>Students are receiving mixed messages on smoking policy. This is reflected in the poor 
student awareness of school smoking policy.

The 1996 Nova Scotia Student Drug Use survey provides information about alcohol, tobacco, 
other drug use, problems resulting from use, gambling and other risk behaviours among 
adolescent students across the province. The estimated prevalence of those behaviours is based 
on a randomly selected sample of 3,790 students in grades 7, 9, 10 and 12.<P>
Based on the 1996 survey, more than one-third of Nova Scotia students in grades 7, 9 10 and 
12 smoke cigarettes and about 7% smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day. About one in every 
three adolescent students uses cannabis and about 12% use cannabis more often than once per 
month. Psilocybin/mescaline, non-prescribed stimulants and LSD are used by 8% to 12% of 
adolescent students. About one in every five students uses alcohol and tobacco and 
cannabis.<P>
The survey revealed a marked increase in the prevalence of cigarette smoking, and the use of 
hallucinogens and stimulants, from 1991 to 1996. In particular, compared with 1991, cigarette 
smoking is 1.3 times more widespread, cannabis use has nearly doubled, the use of cannabis 
more than once per month has nearly tripled, and multiple drug use involving alcohol and 
tobacco and cannabis has increased 1.8 times. On a positive note, the overall prevalence of 
alcohol use and of the use of seven other drugs remained relatively stable from 1991 to 
1996.<P>
The upswing in drug use is not unique to Nova Scotia. The situation in Newfoundland and 
Labrador, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick is similar to that in Nova Scotia. 
Furthermore, an increasing trend in substance use among adolescents has been noted recently in 
other places, including Ontario, British Columbia, the United States and the United 
Kingdom.<P>
A special situation may exist in the case of prescribed and non-prescribed stimulants. The 
increased prevalence of prescribed stimulants found through the 1996 survey is corroborated by 
information from the Nova Scotia Prescription Monitoring Program. The utilization of Ritalin®, 
a stimulant sometimes prescribed as part of the management of Attention Deficit Disorder, 
increased from 1993 to 1995. The numbers of Ritalin® scripts and pills prescribed to patients 
20 years of age or younger nearly doubled during that three-year period. Ritalin® is a controlled 
drug sometimes diverted from the licit to the illicit drug market. There is cause for concern, 
particularly because students on Ritalin® for medical purposes may be coerced into giving up 
their medication.<P>
About 20% of Nova Scotia adolescents with a driver's license report driving within one hour of 
consuming two or more drinks of alcohol. More than 40% of sexually active senior high school 
students engage in unplanned sexual intercourse because they are under the influence of alcohol 
or drugs. About 15% engage in unprotected sexual intercourse because they or their sexual 
partner are under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Unplanned and unprotected sexual activity 
are particularly worrisome because of the high risk of unintended pregnancy and sexually 
transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, among adolescents. <P>
The majority of students who consume alcohol have at least one alcohol-related problem. 
About 15% of students who use drugs have at least one drug-related problem.<P>
About two in every three adolescent students participate in at least one gambling activity in the 
course of a year, and about one in every three students does so at least once per month. The 
two top-ranking gambling activities are playing lottery other than the Sport Select lottery and 
playing cards for money. Males are more likely than females to play cards for money, bet on 
sports activities, play video lottery games, and play the Sport Select lottery. About 3% of 
adolescent students have had problems as a result of gambling and 2% feel they would like to 
stop gambling but do not think they can.<P>
The vast majority of students are aware of school rules regarding alcohol and tobacco on school 
property. However, some students see inconsistencies in the enforcement of school rules. About 
80% of junior high and 50% of senior school students recall having received classes on alcohol, 
tobacco and other drugs. Some students see a need for more sex and drug education and for 
different approaches to drug education.<P>
Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick 
collaborated in developing a standardized protocol for student drug use surveys. The benefits of 
the 1996 Standardized Student Drug Use Surveys in the Atlantic Provinces include comparable 
epidemiological information about adolescents' drug use, a high level of confidence in the 
findings, and an enhanced ability to address adolescent drug use in each province and in the 
region as a whole. <P>

The 1996 Student Drug Use Survey is the first of its kind to be administered in Newfoundland and Labrador. Its purpose is to monitor the use of alcohol and other drugs among Newfoundland and Labrador students in grades 7, 9, 10 and 12 and to obtain information regarding key issues surrounding adolescent drug use (for example, risk factors, high risk behaviours, student awareness of programs and policies). Through successful monitoring, educational and prevention programs as well as support services can be targeted toward specific groups of students, ensuring a higher success rate for these programs and services.<P>
The survey was administered to 3613 Newfoundland and Labrador students across all health regions providing a representative sample of the adolescent population. In total, 184 classes in 106 schools participated in the survey. This report describes the findings and provides some comparisons between the Newfoundland and Labrador data and data collected from other provincial and national reports.<P>
Alcohol is the most commonly used drug by Newfoundland and Labrador students. Over 56% of students reported consuming alcohol in the 12 months prior to the survey. Approximately one third of students report getting drunk or drinking more than five drinks on one occasion in the month prior to the survey. Drinking and driving still appears to be widespread with nearly one third of students saying they had been a passenger with a driver who was under the influence of alcohol.<P>
Tobacco is the second most popular drug among students with 36.7% of students stating they had smoked cigarettes in the previous 12 months. Students note two main reasons for 
continuing to smoke: it is enjoyable and it is too hard to quit. This admission that smoking is too hard to quit and the fact that most students have unsuccessfully tried to quit in the six months prior to the survey demonstrates the addictive nature of the habit.<P>
Consistent with other studies across the country, cannabis is the third most popular drug among adolescents. Nearly one quarter (23.9%) of students report using cannabis either regularly or on an experimental basis in the 12 months prior to the survey. As with alcohol and tobacco use, cannabis use tends to increase with age placing older students in a higher risk category for substance use.<P>
Other drug use studies in previous years identified a gender gap between male and female drug use with males reporting higher use than females. Although the current study does show that males still tend to report more frequent and heavier use patterns for most drugs, it is also apparent that the gender gap is narrowing so that use among females is becoming more comparable to that of males. In fact, the present results show that female smokers outnumber male smokers. This decrease in differences however, is not due to an overall decrease in male use but to an overall increase in female use.<P>
With tighter economical resources, educational and prevention programs need to be more streamlined and targeted towards specific groups. Focusing on student views and monitoring substance use among adolescents is an effective means of identifying high risk groups and of determining the needs of the student community as a whole.<P>

</UL><P><B>Conclusions</B>
<P>Alcohol and tobacco were the most popular used drugs among students in the four Atlantic provinces. The use of alcohol and tobacco was the highest in Newfoundland. The use of Cannabis and cocaine was higher in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick than in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. In 1996 there was an increase in the percentage of New Brunswick students who used most types of drugs compared to 1992. A similar finding was observed in Nova Scotia.
<P>The 1994 Canada's Alcohol and Other Drug Survey also reported increases in Cannabis use by young Canadians. The use of drugs by this age group in New Brunswick is comparable to that obtained in Ontario (the 1995 Ontario Student Drug Use Survey). An increasing trend in the use of Cannabis was also observed in Ontario. In British Columbia (the 1995 Student Survey Report), rates for the use of some substances (alcohol, tobacco, Cannabis and LSD) were reportedly higher than those found in the Atlantic provinces. Differences in the availability of some drugs could account for the pattern of use of these drugs in the Atlantic provinces.

</UL><P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<P>L'alcool et le tabac ont été les deux drogues les plus souvent consommées par les élèves dans les quatre provinces de l'Atlantique. La consommation d'alcool et de tabac était plus élevée à Terre-Neuve. La consommation de cannabis et de cocaine était plus élevée en Nouvelle-Écosse et au Nouveau-Brunswick par rapport à l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard et à Terre-Neuve. En 1996, il y eu une augmentation du pourcentage d'élèves Néo-Brunswickois qui ont consommé la plupart des genres de drogues par rapport à 1992. Des résultats semblables ont été signalés en NouvelleÉcosse.
<P>En 1994, <I>Canada's Alcohol and Other Drug Survey</I> signalait aussi une augmentation de la consommation de cannabis parmi les jeunes canadiens. La consommation de drogues dans ce groupe d'âge au Nouveau-Brunswick est comparable aux résultats obtenus en Ontario (le <I>1995 Ontario Student Drug Use Survey</I>). On a aussi remarqué une augmentation de la tendance à consommer du cannabis en Ontario. En Colombie-Britannique (le <I>1995 Student Drug Survey</I>) les taux de consommation de certaines substances (alcool, tabac, cannabis et LSD) étaient plus élevés que ceux des provinces de l'Atlantique. Les différences dans la disponibilité de certaines drogues pourraient expliquer l'usage de ces drogues dans les provinces de l'Atlantique .

Bringg . . . the sound of happy voices and lockers slamming entered the halls.  School had 
finished for the week and a long weekend lay ahead.  Jill McGrady loaded her books into 
her bag and started home.  She couldn't wait to get home and veg out in front of the TV 
for a couple of hours.  Jill was in the door and getting a pop from the fridge when the 
phone rang.<P>
"Hello, McGrady residence."<P>
"Hey Jill, this is Steph.  Are ya doin' anything tonight?"<P>
"Nope, why?"<P>
"Well, I was wondering if you could come to this party at Jon's tonight?  It starts at eight, 
and it's going to be awesome!"<P>
"Sure why not?"<P>
Steph picked Jill up at seven forty-five and they arrived at Jon's by eight fifteen.  The 
music was blaring and people were dancing when Steph and Jill walked in.  Steph 
introduced Jill to a couple of guys she had never met before, and Jill was having a great 
time getting to know them better.  Jill was getting thirsty when one of the guys (Bob) said 
he was thirsty and asked if anyone wanted a drink.  They all said yes.  When Bob returned 
he handed out the beer.  Jill took one and was about to open it when realized what she had 
just agreed to drink.  She couldn't believe it, they were all drinking.  She looked at Steph 
for some support, but she was so engrossed in conversation that she hadn't even realized 
what she had in her hand.  Finally Jill got up the courage and asked Bob if there was any 
Coke or other nonalcoholic drinks that she could have instead.  "Why?  Don't you want a 
beer?"  Bob asked.<P>
"No thanks I'll have a Coke or something instead."<P>
"O.K.  I'll go ask Jon if he's got any in the fridge."<P>
Steph had realized by this time what she had in her hand and had asked Bob to bring her a 
Sprite.  While Bob was gone, Steph and Jill talked.  Steph told Jill that she was grateful 
that she stood up and said "NO."  Otherwise Steph probably wouldn't have been able to 
say NO.  Jill and Steph drank their pop and had a great time, even though they said NO to 
the beer.<P>
In this situation Jill's friends respected her enough to let her make her own decisions about 
whether or not to drink.  Jill was lucky, but there have been others who haven't been able 
to say no, or once they did, have lost friends because of it.  To gain those friendships back 
they have bent their own value system and therefore lost their self-esteem.  Jill did not 
impose her values on her friends and she did not preach at them, telling them that she 
didn't believe what they were doing was right.<P>
The respect that Jill had from her friends is sometimes hard to find in groups.  A teen I 
interviewed says that "respect should play a big part in the friendships you choose," it will 
make it easier to say 'no' to your peers if they respect the decisions you make.  It will also 
make it easier for your friends to say no to something they don't want to do if you respect 
them.  The respect from your friends will not make it a cinch to say no, but it will help you 
keep those friendships you may have otherwise have lost.<P>
In any class you take where they teach about drugs and alcohol, they make it seem that it 
is enough to say NO and you'll never have another problem with both drugs and alcohol.  
This doesn't always work, but it seems to be the best philosophy.  The teenage girl says 
that the best way to say NO to both drugs and alcohol is to do just that, say no thanks, 
"don't impose your values, that makes them feel pressured."  If your friends and the people 
around you don't respect you enough to leave you alone, you should maybe choose some 
new friends.  This may sound harsh and not called for, but if they don't respect you enough 
to let you keep your values, then they are not really your friends.  I'm not saying dump all 
your friends and go find new ones because that would almost be impossible.  I'm just 
saying have a few close friends who respect your values or even have the same values as 
you, so that when the drinks are passed around or you are offered some dope it will be a 
lot easier to say NO because there are people who will support you.<P>
When you say NO, be sure about what you are saying, say it with confidence.  When you 
say "NO thanks," say it as if you mean it "NO THANKS!!"  Don't be shy and say it as if 
you are insecure, "no thanks."  Find the point between being rude, and being shy and 
insecure.  If you are rude and push your values on them, then you will lose your friends 
because they will feel pressured by you.  Whereas if you are shy and insecure, you will be 
scoffed at, laughed at, and made fun of, and they may pressure you to the point, where 
you end up saying 'yes' to the drugs or alcohol and then regret it.  BE SURE, NOT 
INSECURE, knowing you have the right to choose for yourself.<P>
These are the things you need to remember most when you are trying to say NO to drugs 
and/or alcohol and keep your friends.  Be sure, not insecure.  Surround yourself with 
people who respect you and will back off when you say NO.  If your friends don't respect 
you, they aren't your true friends.  Remember it is always easier to say NO when you are 
surrounded by people who respect you and even have the same values.<P>

alcohol and keep your friends!<BR>
By Lisa Mandrusiak</H3>
Peer pressure is a force that teenagers have to live with everyday.  It influences us in all 
aspects of our life--from friends to school work to social life--although it also includes 
heavy duty pressure about things like drugs and alcohol.<P>
During the teenage years, having and keeping friends is one of the uppermost things in 
your mind.  Your social status becomes so important that you would be willing to do 
whatever it takes to be accepted, even if it isn't something that you agree with.  Some of 
the most difficult decisions you have to face may involve the use of illegal substances like 
drugs or alcohol.<P>
If your friends are all trying drugs for the first time and you don't want to, it can be very 
difficult to stand up for yourself.  Your sound reasons, such as drugs are just plain stupid, 
can be easily brushed aside with comments like "all the cool people are trying it," or 
"there's no harm in just trying it once."  The key is to be able to defend yourself and your 
reasons.  If your "friends" try to pressure you into something that you don't want to do, 
they probably aren't the kind of friends that you want or need.<P>
One approach is to simply avoid situations where you know drugs and alcohol could be in 
use.  Instead, spend time with other friends who share your logical feelings that drugs and 
alcohol are illegal and not the "cool" thing to be doing.  It is not difficult at all to find 
people who are against these habits.<P>
Something that everyone should realize is that your social standing is not the most 
important thing in your life.  It is difficult to understand this until you become older and 
impressing friends becomes much less essential, but you can start to realize that quality is 
much more important than quantity where friends are concerned.  If you find that your 
friends are constantly putting you in tough situations where you have to resist peer 
pressure about drugs and alcohol, perhaps it is time to find some other friends.<P>
However, finding new friends isn't always that simple.  It is usually more desirable to find 
a way in which you can "coexist" with your friends who want to use drugs or alcohol.  
First of all, it is probably easier to discuss your feelings with one close friend rather than a 
whole group.  That way, you will not feel the pressure involved when you don't go along 
with the clique, and there is a better chance of making your reasons understood if your 
friend is not trying to act "cool" as well.  Discuss thoroughly all the reasons you have for 
being against drug and alcohol use, and chances are your friend will be on your side one 
hundred percent.  Together, you may find it easier to defend yourselves in front of your 
other friends, than on your own.<P>
If you would rather explain to your whole group at once your feelings about drug and 
alcohol use, make sure to explain yourself clearly.  Also, make sure you stick to your 
story--there is nothing less convincing than a person preaching about the problems of drug 
and alcohol use with a beer in his or her hand!  If you are able to defend yourself well, 
chances are that you will be left pretty much alone where drug and alcohol decisions are 
concerned.  Once your friends who use alcohol or drugs are clear about your reasons for 
being against it, they will probably respect you for being so strong.<P>
Another aspect to consider is how to keep your non-substance using friends.  The simple 
way to do this is to not go back on your word, to not try drugs or get drunk.  They will 
respect you for having the strength and courage to stand up for yourself, but would easily 
lose that respect if you disappointed them.  Believe me, gaining respect back, that was 
lost, is a lot more difficult than gaining the respect in the first place.<P>
The key element in standing up to peer pressure is to be true to yourself.  It is always best 
to do whatever you think is right, rather than simply going along with the crowd.  By 
trying to do the right thing all the time and listening to yourself, you should be able to deal 
with any peer pressure that comes your way.<P>

<H3><A NAME = patricia></A>Keeping the path 
clear<BR>
By Patricia Haydon</H3>
Picture it.  Any hospital ... in any town, Canada ... at any time of the year.  Things are 
going quite routinely here, (if life in a hospital is routine at all).  All of a sudden though, all 
hell breaks loose and chaos reigns.  We are rushing to the door, the muscles in our legs 
begging for mercy from the constant tension.  I can hear the ambulance all the way down 
the street, its piercing red siren and smoking tires telling us with no words the grave 
nature of your situation.  No, you didn't fall off your bike.  You weren't even in an 
accident as such.  All of this came about because you chose to delve into something not 
even the devil himself could handle with success.  That's right, I'm talking about the 
cesspool that is drug use, and you, John Q. Teenager, have fallen into the whole stinking 
mess.<P>
When the doors swing open, you are a dusky grey colour, your eyes devoid of any 
recognition.  You are also not breathing, and you don't have any pulse to speak of.  Many 
people like myself have seen this many times, and you couldn't possibly know how 
depressing it really gets.<P>
We are working on you constantly now, and the monitors tell us that we're not 
succeeding.  The tension in the room is unbelievable; our knuckles are growing whiter and 
our brains growing more and more numb.  After 20 minutes of nothing but our maximum 
effort, we lose hope and concede our defeat.  The drugs in your system were the enemy, 
and this time, they won.<P>
What went on here was sad.  I mean, you looked like a nice enough kid; at one time you 
were probably every parent's dream.  What breaks my heart is a double edged sword.  I 
couldn't save you tonight.  But the nightmare has just begun.  You see, I won't be able to 
save your parents either.  A part of them will die when they have to go down to the 
morgue to identify your now cold body, and they will have to make plans for a funeral that 
is much before its time.  This kind of pain never goes away.<P>
As I turn my attention towards cleaning things up in the emergency room, the reality of 
the situation hits me like a hammer, and I have to sit down.  When I get up, I pick up my 
stethoscope, and then head out the door.  I walk away from the carnage, as the door thuds 
to a close behind me.  It is then that I know that the door to your life has been closed 
forever.  I think to myself, "Was it really worth DYING for?"<P>
This is an entirely fictional story.  I'm no doctor, in fact, I'm just your average teenager.  In 
reality, the things that I wrote about DO go on in hundreds of hospitals across the country 
every year, every day of the week.  The fight against teenage drug abuse is often a life and 
death battle, and unfortunately, many times the drugs emerge the victors, claiming the 
lives of those who use them, and claiming other lives in a more subtle, yet just as 
devastating ways.  These people make a choice, and they wind up paying the ultimate 
consequence.  To be totally honest, I really don't get all that teary eyed anymore when I 
hear of another O.D. somewhere.  In reality, it makes me madder than Hell itself.<P>
Why, you ask?  It is really quite simple.  Kids out to have fun or to be cool like their 
friends all too often wind up stone cold in the morgue, waiting for their families to claim 
them.  Did they think of what it might do to someone they loved if they weren't around 
anymore?  Probably not.  A high price to pay just to be cool.<P>
Now, what can I do as part of a peer group to keep kids like me on the right path?  Right 
from the beginning, I don't believe that the path starts with anyone in society at the head of 
the pack.  Rather, I believe that the path to drug free begins with each individual person 
setting a positive example for themselves and others around them.  After all, it is much 
easier to get kids to pay attention to the right example if you ARE that example.<P>
The motivation that keeps me going is twofold.  First off, I have dreams for my future that 
I want nothing to hold me back from.  Secondly, I have four sisters at home, all of whom 
are younger than myself.  The shame that I would feel in not living up to the responsibility 
of being a positive example would probably cut me in two.  That's the one key word here 
that I've been looking for: responsibility.  Do yourself a favour.  If you don't think it is 
your responsibility as a young adult to keep the new generation on the right path, think 
again.  Just look into the eyes of a young child who thinks the world of you and try to tell 
him you're going to let him lose his way.  If you can do that and not feel any guilt, then in 
reality, you have a lot of growing up to do yourself.<P>

and alcohol free, the way to be<BR>
By Tara Baxter</H3>
The thoughts of a drug addict ...<P>
The wind is bitterly cold and howls past me as I huddle in this corner.  There is no place to 
go on such a desolate night as this and nothing to do, but think.  All I can think of and 
want is the next "fix" that sends me soaring above my problems, my worries and my 
dismal life!  All that I am focused on is getting high.  Only a few hours ago, I achieved the 
single goal of my life, to get high and escape.  But now, the high is over and I must face 
reality ... my reality.  My reality is a life on the streets and every moment is a fight for 
survival.  All I used to want was the basics - food to eat and a roof over my head.  That 
means nothing to me now.  The only things that matter to me now are the drugs and the 
high.  I sometimes forget to eat when I'm high or I just don't care.  Where you sleep means 
nothing to a drug addict, only the drugs are important.  My life is pathetic now, but it 
wasn't always this way.  I used to be a normal teenager, with hopes and dreams.  Who 
ever would have thought that my life would turn out this way?!<P>
My great descending spiral into the abyss of drug addiction all began quite innocently.  I 
was 15 years old and felt I owned the world.  Nothing could harm me and I only wanted 
to have fun.  My idea of fun included going to wild parties and hanging out with friends 
my parents hated.  I wanted to be "cool" and fit in with my peer group.  Being cool meant 
that I must do certain things such as smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol.  It all 
seemed normal to me because my friends always said, "Everybody else does it, why 
shouldn't you?"  Real friends wouldn't pressure you into doing something you know is 
wrong.  If only I had known then what trouble alcohol can start.  Alcohol is a drug and no 
matter what you tell yourself, you will always know that.  The pleasurable experience 
caused by alcohol is heavily outweighed by the disadvantages.<P>
After a few beers I was ready to try anything and that was my problem.  I was soon 
introduced to the experience of smoking marijuana and all my worries seemed to melt 
away.  The truth was that ignoring my problems only made them worse.  The worse my 
problems got, the more drugs I had to take to escape from them.  The progression from 
marijuana to harder drugs now came easily to me.  As I slipped deeper into the cold, cruel 
world of hard drugs, I became more separated from the existence I once knew.  Friends 
and family I loved seemed like strangers as I became more alienated and self-involved.  I 
was so very selfish and only thought of what I wanted ... the drugs.  I never thought about 
the suffering I caused my loved ones.<P>
If I had a choice now, I would never have gotten involved with the seamy underworld of 
narcotics.  Drugs change your life for the worse and you are never the same again.  I have 
become someone I never wanted to be thanks to the monster of addiction.  Like so many 
other drug addicts, I live on the streets and have no real home.  Homelessness is often a 
direct result of drug addiction.<P>
I would be content with the mess that is my life, if I could accomplish one good thing.  I 
would want to warn everyone about the dangers of drugs.  Drug free is the way to be 
because it insures you clarity of mind and a future.<P>
I don't know what my future will be, but if I stay on drugs it will be worth nothing.  I may 
die of or become permanently brain damaged, and drugs are not worth that price.  I want 
to get better and stay drug free.  There are people out there who care and want to help.  I 
shall break the circle of drug addiction and become part of another circle.  This drug free 
circle leads to a new, healthier life and a brighter future.  Someday I can return and help 
someone in my present condition, thus renewing the circle.  But, that is tomorrow and I 
must get through today.  Always remember, one small step is a step closer to success.<P>

<H3><A NAME = lindsay></A>How to say no to drugs 
and alcohol and still keep your friends<BR>
By Lindsay Grisdale</H3>
It is hard to fit in today.  Kids are all trying to dress, act, and even talk alike in order to be 
accepted.  In today's society people tend to ridicule and exclude anyone who is even 
remotely different.  It's hard to be different and stand up for what you think is right.  
However, it is not impossible.  With communication, the help of others, self-control, and 
self-belief, you too can say no to drugs and alcohol and keep your friends.<P>
Communication is a big aspect in saying no to drugs and alcohol while still maintaining 
your friendships.  People will become offended if all you ever say to them is no.  Explain 
to them briefly why you don't want to drink or do drugs and they may understand or 
relate.  In this way, you may be able to strike up some conversation and possibly make a 
new friend.  If they don't agree or understand where you are coming from, at least you 
have made your point and they will be less likely to pressure you further.  Communication 
also allows you to let people know that you can still be a good friend and fun to be 
around, even though you don't drink or do drugs.  Communication is the best way to meet 
new people, get your message across, and say no to drugs and alcohol.<P>
By relying on the help of others, it can be easier to do what you feel is right.  You can get 
support from other friends who feel the same way about drugs and alcohol as you do.  
This crowd will be more accepting of your choice because they can relate.  You can also 
rely on friends who do drink, but respect your decision not to.  They are less apt to 
pressure you when you go out and they are more apt to help you "fend" off someone who 
is pressuring you.  However, there are some people that you can't rely on.  These are the 
people who are continually pressuring you to drink or do drugs.  They also get upset and 
call you down if you refuse.  These people are definitely not your friends.  By getting help 
and acceptance from friends who stand by your decision, it is easier to say no to drugs and 
alcohol.  You can still have a good time and keep your friends and your self-respect.<P>
True friends will stick by you, only if you stick by yourself.  In order to stand strong, you 
must have self-control and self-belief as an individual who chooses not to drink or use 
drugs.  Self-belief comes from the fact that you believe that saying no to drugs and alcohol 
is the right thing to do.  People will see how strongly you stand against it and some will 
respect you for being so persistent.  Self-belief helps you to convince yourself and the 
others that your decision to remain drug-free is the right one.  Self-control is the voice 
inside of you that enables you to resist the "head on" temptations at parties and gatherings.  
It allows you to face the temptation of a friend or a bottle and say no.  Self-control enables 
you determine for yourself whether you want to fit in or whether you want to do what is 
right.  Self-control may also involve staying away from places and people involved with 
alcohol or drugs.  You may have to go to a movie instead of a drinking party just because 
it is easier to say no and the people there are more accepting of your choice.  Self-belief 
and self-control allow you to stand up for what you believe in and show others that you 
really mean what you say.<P>
By using your resources such as communication, friends, your self-belief, and your self-
control, you can accomplish a major task.  This task is saying no to drugs and alcohol and 
still keeping your friends.  In today it takes a lot of courage to go against the crowd to do 
what you believe in your heart is right.  To anyone reading this who has made this decision 
and has had the strength to follow through with it, I commend you.  You, as an individual, 
have done something of utmost importance.  In our society, you have become a model 
individual which is a highly honored role and you are an incredible person for doing what 
you have done.<P>

drug and alcohol free, the way to be!<BR>
By Rebecca Harrison</H3>
Drug abuse has become one of most serious health problems North American society 
faces.  This modern day plague is responsible for thousands of deaths, and impoverishes 
and destroys the lives of many more.  It is of such magnitude that in 1986 alone, its 
victims spent over seven hundred million dollars for illegal drugs.  To eradicate this 
scourge we must educate, support and care for those of our brothers and sisters it claims.  
WE MUST KEEP THE CIRCLE STRONG!<P>
Educating ourselves and others must be the first step.  Drugs which can be abused are 
classified into five groups: stimulants, depressants, narcotics, hallucinogens, and others.  
Stimulants are drugs that cause alertness and arousal.  When taken in large doses they can 
cause excitability and inhibit fatigue and sleep.  Among stimulants are found 
amphetamines, cocaine, caffeine and nicotine.  Drugs that induce relaxation and lower 
anxiety are depressants.  In high doses, depressants may cause drowsiness and sleep or 
even coma.  This group includes sedatives for example barbiturates, methaqualone, and 
alcohol.  Narcotics are a distinct type of depressant.  These drugs make pain less intense 
and give a sense of well-being.  In medicine, narcotics are used as painkillers.  Narcotics 
include heroin, morphine, opium and codeine.  Hallucinogens produce unusual mental 
states.  They can cause the user to fantasize and experience illusions.  Hallucinogens 
include LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin.  The final group includes other drugs which can 
affect the mind, for example marijuana and Ritalin.<P>
Secondly, so that we can support those who are unable to confront their drug abuse, we 
must understand the power of their habit.  People usually abuse drugs because they are 
pressured by peers to use them, because they are in a time of crisis and want to escape 
reality, or because they are bored and want more to life.  Frequently they are ignorant of 
the side effects of these powerful, but illegal, drugs and do not know how deadly they can 
be.  A common reason for people to begin using these drugs is experimentation.  They 
plan to stop after one encounter but they are unable to stop taking the drug.  Eventually 
drug dependence occurs and can be perilous.<P>
The first stage of drug dependence occurs when users take the drug over an extended 
period of time.  When the second stage is reached they are impotent and cannot quit.  The 
users may drop out of school, steal, leave home and perhaps go to jail.  All this so they 
can continue taking their drugs.  To make things worse, if the user stops taking the drug, 
agonizing physical and mental distress may ensue.<P>
To prevent people from taking illegal drugs, we must keep the circle strong.  Keeping the 
circle strong means teaching others about the dangers of different drugs and drug abuse, 
but it also means letting people, especially teenagers, realize that they have the power to 
say NO to drugs.  Their confidence can be built up by seeing people they admire, for 
example sports stars, actors and actresses publicly talking about the dangers of drug 
abuse, and that drug abuse causes more problems than it solves.  Finally, they can be 
assured that there are facilities for those who cannot fight overwhelming drug addiction on 
their own.<P>
In conclusion, drug abuse is a major problem in our society.  Keeping the circle strong 
means all of us being aware of what dangers drug abuse can bring.  It means supporting 
our friends who are tempted by drugs.  It means helping those organizations who support 
those battling drug dependency.<P>

<H3><A NAME = melanie></A>How to say no to drugs 
and alcohol and keep your friends<BR>
By Melanie Caines</H3>
Drugs are defined as chemical substances used to alter a person's body and mind.  But 
drugs are not always beneficial to their users, especially if one abuses them.  There can be 
many harmful effects to an abuser of drugs.  There may be emotional, physical, and social 
distress to the abuser, their family, and friends.<P>
People who abuse drugs take them for recreational reasons, not medical.  Many people 
use drugs such as alcohol, marijuana and cocaine to gain a sense of well being.  This 
process is known as "getting high."  But there are serious consequences of using drugs for 
recreation.  Some drugs cause people to be violent, to lose control of themselves and their 
behavior, or they may develop a mental illness.  Sometimes taking too much drugs can be 
fatal.<P>
Now, after reading these facts, why would anyone ever desire to use drugs?  Well, perhaps 
some young people use drugs because they were told not to.  Young people don't like to 
be told what to do, so they rebel.  They want to be independent and make their own 
decisions.  Another reason why young people may take drugs is to escape from reality, 
and their problems at home and school.  But taking drugs may only worsen the situation.  
Young people should realize that taking drugs doesn't make you grown up, or look cool.  
It does just the opposite.  Drugs damage your life and make you look stupid.<P>
One extremely common reason why young people take drugs is because of peer pressure.  
They think, "Everyone else is doing it so why shouldn't I?" or, "All my friends take drugs 
and I want to be with them and do what they're doing."  These reasons are probably the 
dumbest of them all.  If all of your friends decided to take a gun and commit suicide, 
would you?  Of course not.  You wouldn't kill yourself with a gun just to be with your 
friends and do what they are doing, right?  So why would you kill yourself by using drugs 
to be with your friends and do what they do?<P>
It may be easy to rationalize it this way now, but when the situation occurs in your life, it 
may not be as easy to solve.  Everyone wants to have friends and do what they do, but 
you may find yourself cut off from them because you don't want to use drugs.  Young 
people have to be strong and stand up for themselves when put in this situation.  They 
have to realize that it's okay to say "no" and not to be like everyone else, even if it means 
losing their so-called friends.<P>
Another way young people can avoid using drugs is to keep themselves occupied so they 
don't get so bored that they have to resort to drugs.  Getting involved in "natural highs" - 
doing things they enjoy doing.  This may include sports, hobbies, exercise, social clubs, or 
after-school activities.<P>
Just as you have a responsibility to yourself not to get involved in drugs, you also have a 
responsibility to your friends that are involved in drugs.  If you don't want to get involved, 
even at the risk of losing your friends, you have to make them choose between your 
friendship and drugs.  You should talk to them and let them know that what they are 
doing is wrong; but don't push them.  You may even have to confide in an adult about the 
matter, but remember, you would be helping them, not hurting them.<P>
It doesn't matter how many people get involved with drugs, it still doesn't make it right to 
take them.  Nothing is cool about getting stoned, or being labelled a "stoner."  People 
have to be strong and learn to make their own decisions.  They should not let others make 
their decisions for them.  They have to realize that it's okay to say "no," and it's the right 
thing to do.  Anyway, true friends would not ask you to ruin your life using drugs and 
alcohol.  Remember, using drugs is like committing suicide, only it is a painful, lengthy 
process which will haunt you for the rest of your life.<P>

<H3><A NAME = kendra></A>Drug free the way to 
be<BR>
By Kendra Kramer</H3>
DRUGS!!  That single word will take away everything that has any importance in my life!  
Piece by piece it will pull away friends and family and anything else that has any value to 
me.  It could even take away a life.  The question is why?  Why, would you want to risk 
losing family, friends, your appearance and your health?  What specifically do you want to 
get involved in?  The gangs?  The abuse?  The danger?  Those are questions you have to 
answer by yourself.  The reason that I'm here is to give you a little information on 
them.<P>
My main reason for not getting involved is the fact that I have never been able to find a 
reason to.  Sure, there are plenty of excuses out there.  Peer pressure.  Relieving stress.  
Excuses is all they are though.  How can taking drugs relieve stress?  I think it creates 
stress.  What is more stressful?  A good job, a happy family, a loving spouse, and a busy 
social life or a broken family, no job, welfare, and the law on your back?  The choice is 
yours!<P>
Speaking of the police, how would you like a whole police force chasing you?  Drugs are 
illegal!  I'll say that again to make sure it is pounded into your head.  Drugs are illegal!  
So, if you plan on getting involved with drugs you also better plan on police.  Then again, 
if you're the type who enjoys jail cells, go for it.  It's your choice!<P>
When you get involved with drugs it is usually because you have a connection or source to 
them.  That connection is most often an acquaintance of some sort.  Before you decide on 
whether or not you want to get involved you may want to take a good look at not only 
your life but also your "acquaintance's" life.  Analyze and decide if you'd like to spend the 
rest of your life like that.  Do you want to be involved with gangs?  You may not think 
they are very dangerous but they are.  Gangs are extremely dangerous.  Many gang 
members are killed each year.  And, what about innocent victims who just happened to be 
at the wrong place at the wrong time?  Do you want to be responsible for taking a 
person's life?  It's your choice!<P>
Since we are on the topic of life what about your own?  The physical effect of drugs is 
devastating.  So many different things could go wrong.  You could overdose on them or 
mix the wrong drugs together.  Try to find a few people who enjoy having their stomach 
pumped or their liver replaced.  If you overdose it not only ruins your physical health but 
also your mental health.  If your drug intake is too high you can lose millions of brain cells 
but if you decided to take drugs I doubt you had very many to begin with.  Overdoses can 
lead to violence and abuse.  But, it's your choice!<P>
Violence and abuse is becoming an all too common thing.  You don't even realize what 
you are doing.  You could be mauling somebody and think it is hilarious.  These people 
are very dangerous.  Stay far away from them.  The abuse isn't always physical, though.  
What if you said something foolish to your spouse?  What if your spouse files for a 
divorce?  It will probably be something you'll regret for the rest of your life.  For no 
logical reason you've ruined your relationship with the person you had planned on 
spending the rest of your life with.  Hey, it was your choice!<P>
Drugs not only affect your physical and mental health but also your social health.  Those 
are the three main components of your health.  I hope this is worrying you because it sure 
scares me.  Who is going to want to hang out with a drug addict?  You'll probably lose all 
your friends that truly care about you.  Then you'll have to make new "friends".  What do 
you plan on doing when your "friends" die or get busted?  What happens when you get 
busted?  Do you honestly think they are going to hang around to see if you are O.K.?  
They don't want to get busted so don't ever plan on seeing them again.  Where does that 
leave you?  I'll tell you.  That leaves you all alone with nobody that cares.  Once again, it's 
your choice!<P>
Since we are on the topic of social life, what about your reputation?  So, you have decided 
that drugs are the right thing to do.  What about others?  I, for one, don't want to be 
associated with drug addicts.  They are too dangerous.  You might not believe it but there 
are a lot of people who love being drug free.  It's your choice.<P>
Another thing is employment.  Not many employers are going to want to hire somebody 
with a police record a mile long.  And, yes, you'll have a police record.  You won't get 
away with beating on people, stealing, and all of the other irrational things you'll do.  It's 
your choice!<P>
Where are you getting your money from?  Money doesn't grow on trees and as I've 
already said jobs for drug addicts don't either.  You've got a low employment rate and a 
fried brain to work with.  That won't take you far if it takes you anywhere at all.  That will 
leave you with one choice.  Using money that isn't yours.  Whether you borrow it from a 
friend or stoop to stealing it, it is doubtful their money will ever be returned.  Robbery, 
another federal offense that will put you in jail.  It's your choice!<P>
There are only two things that I want you to remember.  One, if you are seriously 
considering drugs take the time to sit down and write all the negatives involved.  Then try 
and think of some positives, if there are any.  My final point is that your decision on drugs 
is your choice.  Not mine, not your friends, not your parents, but yours.  Life is important.  
Drugs ruin your life.  Imagine being cut off from your friends and family.  Imagine your 
health and your appearance.  And worst of all imagine living without a future.  Living 
without ambitions and goals.  Living without dreams.  With drugs you have nothing to 
look forward to except a life of pain and misery.  Is it worth it?  When it came time for me 
to make a choice, I decided that ... DRUG FREE IS THE WAY TO BE!!<P>

drug and alcohol free, the way to be<BR>
By Briana Banico</H3>
Almost every Saturday night, my mom and my little sister meet my dad for dinner 
downtown.  We take the bus and the closest stop to my dad's office, is at Hastings and 
Pender Street.  Many people call this area "Skid Row".  Looking around, all you can see 
are empty alcohol bottles and garbage.  People of different ages, who have been drinking 
or using drugs, sitting on the sidewalks or leaning against shop-fronts.<P>
When we get off at this stop, the first thing I can smell is alcohol, and in small corners of 
the street, the strong stench of urine.  I see people fighting, yelling and falling over.  I see 
lots of ambulances and police almost every time I pass this area.  It's very dirty and there is 
trash cluttering the bus stop.  Sometimes we see used plastic syringe packages on the 
ground.  One time we saw a needle exchange van, distributing and collecting needles to 
drug users.<P>
As we walk through the street, my mom says to walk quickly and with a purpose.  She 
says to keep our heads up, look straight ahead and to hold hands with each other.  We are 
safe when we travel together.<P>
It scares me to see these people who are out of control.  They don't seem to care about 
anything or anybody.  They are young and old, men and women, of many different 
backgrounds and cultures.  I wonder how they ended up there.  Do they have jobs?  
Where are their families?  One time a man came up to me, as we were walking, and asked 
if I wanted to buy some drugs.  I was so shocked that he would approach me - I am only 
eleven years old!  I realized then, that drugs were not just things adults used.<P>
I have heard stories about drugs in high schools.  I have seen empty beer bottles hidden 
under bushes on school property.  I have seen lots of students smoking cigarettes.  
Children younger than myself lighting up cigarettes and blowing rings in the air.  They 
think they are so "cool".  I know the day will come, when I will be challenged or pressured 
by peers to try drugs.  I know my answer will be, "NO!".<P>
Drugs are everywhere, in every city, from "Skid Row" to nice homes in nice 
neighbourhoods.  People who use drugs share a common feeling about themselves - they 
lack confidence, courage and self respect.  Drugs rob people of opportunity.<P>
I find my strength to say no to drugs from my family and friends.  They are the circle that 
surrounds and supports me.  The circle, for centuries, has represented strength, honour, 
and a magical unity of a common interest.  I have many plans for my future.  I look 
forward to the opportunities ahead.  I keep my circle strong by believing in myself, 
remembering what I want to do, and respecting myself and others.  I share my feelings and 
my dreams with my family.  My circle has room for anyone who wants to join me.<P>
I guess my mom was right - walk with a purpose, hold hands for support, and stay 
together.  My hand in yours, we can keep the circle strong.  Drug and alcohol free, the 
way be!<P>

<H3><A NAME = lindsay2></A>Together we can make a 
difference in my community<BR>
By Lindsay Campbell</H3>
"Our town is drug-free and proud of it!"  This statement is something we would all like to 
use for our communities, but we know it's not true.  Teenagers using drugs and alcohol 
has become such a common occurrence that something needs to be done.  If people can 
come together and create a wall between drugs and teenagers, maybe some day we really 
can use this statement.  "Our town is drug-free and proud of it!"<P>
Sam used drugs and alcohol throughout his teen years.  He was abusive as a father and got 
a divorce from his wife of almost twenty years.  At the age of forty-five, Sam realized he 
had lost the most important part of his life to drugs.  He slowly gathered the broken pieces 
of his life and put it back together.  Sam got his community to start a clinic for troubled 
teens, which now has a group of forty teens.  Sam has a success story to tell; because he 
was willing to help his community, which helped him.<P>
Joy, like Sam, was a drug and alcohol abuser.  She grew up in a bad family, turning to 
drugs for comfort.  Her children, because of her drug abuse, also grew up in a bad home.  
One of her children died at birth from infant alcohol syndrome.  Joy also divorced from her 
husband of twenty years, abandoning her four children.  There were no support groups in 
Joy's town.  Her community pushed away those who had problems.  Now Joy lives on 
well-fare, doesn't have a job, and takes several different kinds of medicine just to keep 
alive.  She has been driven to suicide once or twice, but couldn't bring herself to do it.  If 
Joy's community had been able and willing to help her, she could be happy today.<P>
Teenagers need to be able to talk to someone they look up to about drugs and alcohol.  
Learning the risks and effects of alcohol and drugs can make them stop and think.  A 
person who doesn't do drugs or alcohol can be very good for young teenagers.  The most 
effective people in the community would be an older teenager, someone younger teens can 
look up to.  Someone who seems "cool" to the younger teens.<P>
An effective community group should have outgoing, enthusiastic people for leaders.  If 
the group has young adults helping, teenagers would open up better.  Most teens feel 
uncomfortable being open around older "parental" figures, so the people involved should 
never scold or lecture.  Everyone in the group should have a say in discussions.  Groups 
need to do activities that take their minds off the pressure from peers.  Physical activities 
are the best stress releasers, and can be done in large community groups.<P>
Communities should find out what activities teenagers enjoy.  All physical activities may 
not be pleasing to every person.  Forcing a teenager to do what everyone else is doing is 
just what we're trying to get them away from.  Finding out what each individual wants to 
do can make them feel very important, something teenagers need; to feel important.  To be 
able to call the shots, just like an adult.<P>
A large group, like a community, has more effect than one person, like a friend.  When a 
group of people can talk to each other about drugs and alcohol, they can stand up for each 
other.  If one person talks to a teenager about drugs and alcohol, the teenager could still 
feel afraid of their peers.  There would only be one person to back the teenager up.  A 
large group can stand up to pressure far better than two people.  If a teenager feels 
pressure from anyone to take drugs or alcohol, they should gather as many community 
members as they can.  Having a good time within a community may show drug and/or 
alcohol abusers fun can be had without drugs or alcohol.<P>
To lessen the amount of drugs and alcohol at parties, a community could have parties at a 
hall every third week or once every month.  People who plan on drinking or smoking pay 
ten or fifteen dollars at the door, and sit in a small corner of the room when they do 
drink/smoke.  Those who stay clean get in for free and can sit wherever they please.  If 
anyone is caught drinking or smoking without paying, they shouldn't be allowed to the 
party for the next month.  This method could empty these young people's wallets very 
quickly, and maybe clue them in too.<P>
Teenagers are at a confused stage in life, they can't drink or smoke, yet so much is 
expected of them.  So many adult things; large reports, tests, and to act mature.  They 
think that if they have to do the work like adults, why not be able to drink and smoke like 
adults.  Community people need to prove to teenagers that they don't always drink to have 
fun.  They need to treat teenagers with respect of adults, and teenagers will respect the 
adults.  Maybe teens will even listen better if they can earn the trust of adults.<P>
Making a difference in a community can take as little as one person or as much as an 
entire community.  Working together is the key to success, young and old alike can help 
each other understand more about drugs and alcohol.  Having fun and setting a good 
example for teenagers is the job of the adults in a community.  Being responsible and 
learning to have fun without drugs and alcohol is the teenagers job.  This shows that we 
can make a difference, but only when we work together, as a community.<P>

<H2><A NAME = reducing></A>Réduire les 
problèmes à l'aide des politiques municipales en 
matière d'alcool: l'expérience canadienne en 
Ontario</H2>
Les municipalités qui ont officiellement adopté une politique municipale en matière 
d'alcool constatent moins de problèmes liés à l'alcool comme la consommation par les 
mineurs, le grabuge et le vandalisme. C'est là l'une des conclusions d'une étude rendue 
publique aujourd'hui par la Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie (ARF).<P>
L'étude, intitulée <B>Réduire les problèmes à l'aide des politiques municipales en 
matière d'alcool: l'expérience canadienne en Ontario</B>, s'inscrit dans un processus 
continu d'évaluation de l'efficacité des politiques municipales en matière d'alcool. 
Réduisent-elles vraiment les problèmes liés à l'alcool dans les établissements appartenant à 
la municipalité ou gérés par celle-ci? Les établissements municipaux sont, entre autres, les 
patinoires, centres et salles communautaires, centres pour personnes âgées, parcs, plages, 
stades et terrains sportifs, là où l'on servira, éventuellement, de l'alcool, surtout lors des 
activités spéciales.<P>
L'étude est fondée sur des renseignements obtenus de 477 municipalités ontariennes entre 
octobre 1994 et janvier l995. Les deux tiers des municipalités ayant participé à l'étude sont 
dépourvues de politique officielle réglementant l'usage d'alcool dans leurs établissements. 
Cent sept municipalités (22,4 p. 100) ont adopté une politique officielle et 55 (ll,5 p. 100) 
en ont entamé le processus d'élaboration.<P>
En moyenne, les municipalités élaborent une politique en 10 mois. Aussi, 46,7 % des 
municipalités dont la politique est en place, l'ont adoptée moins d'un an avant la tenue de 
l'étude. L'accroissement du nombre de politiques adoptées récemment est le fruit des 
efforts des services de santé publique et de la ARF. La plus grande sensibilisation 
municipale et la réceptivité à ces initiatives ont aussi contribué à cette hausse.<P>
L'étude a également révélé que les municipalités de taille prennent plus de temps pour 
élaborer une politique. Cela s'explique par un nombre élevé d'établissements municipaux, 
une bureaucratie multipliée, une obligation de consulter plusieurs interlocuteurs et 
d'accommoder la mosaique ethnique de la collectivité.<P>
La sécurité, la crainte d'une poursuite éventuelle et les recommandations du personnel des 
services récréatifs sont, selon les autorités municipales, les raisons qui poussent les 
municipalités à adopter une politique municipale en matière d'alcool. Parmi les 
municipalités qui ont adopté une politique officielle, 48,6 p. 100 n'ont observé aucun 
déclin de la demande de locations de leurs établissements.<P>
Au début des années 1990, la ARF et les services de santé publique ont contribué à 
l'élaboration de politiques municipales en matière d'alcool partout en Ontario. Pendant 
cette période, on encourageait les collectivités à: dresser la liste des établissements où 
l'alcool peut, ou ne peut pas, être servi; établir des restrictions en ce qui concerne le 
service de l'alcool jusqu'à l'ivresse; reconduire les clients ivres à la maison; mettre en 
application les règlements en matière du service d'alcool aux mineurs; et exiger un choix 
de boissons à faible teneur en alcool et de nourriture.<P>
L'évaluation de l'efficacité des politiques municipales en matière d'alcool de la ARF 
comportera également une étude contrôlée et détaillée sur le processus d'adoption d'une 
telle politique dans les collectivités choisies et ses répercussions. Les résultats seront 
rendus publics à l'automne 1997.<P>

<H2><A NAME = tobacco></A>Communiqué 
de la Fondation de la recherche sur la 
toxicomanie:  La publicité sur le tabac </H2>
Toronto, le 21 septembre 1995 -- «La décision de la Cour suprême du Canada qui a 
déclaré inconstitutionnelle la loi fédérale interdisant la publicité sur le tabac est un 
gigantesque pas en arrière», déclare le Dr Perry Kendall, président de la Fondation de la 
recherche sur la toxicomanie.<P>
«Chaque année, plus de 40 000 Canadiens succombent des suites de maladies liées au 
tabac comme le cancer, l'emphysème et les maladies cardiaques.  Cela représente trois fois 
le nombre de personnes dont la mort est liée à l'alcool, aux drogues illégales, aux accidents 
de la route, au suicide, au meurtre et au sida réunis», poursuit-il.<P>
«La stratégie la plus efficace visant à réduire ce nombre doit coordonner des facettes 
touchant les taxes, la législation, l'application de la loi, la promotion de la santé et les 
initiatives de prévention. Malheureusement, aujourd'hui, la pierre angulaire de cette 
stratégie a été retirée», ajoute le Dr Kendall.<P>
«La décision prise par la Cour suprême aujourd'hui, combinée à la décision du 
gouvernement fédéral, l'an dernier, de baisser les taxes sur les cigarettes auront pour effet 
d'accroître le nombre de fumeurs en Ontario. La hausse de l'usage de tabac fait grimper le 
coût social du tabagisme, y compris une facture élevée et un énorme fardeau de douleur, 
de souffrance et de pertes de vies», commente le Dr Kendall. Les maladies liées au tabac 
coûtent au gouvernement canadien quelque 9,5 milliards de dollars chaque année.<P>
«La recherche menée au cours des dernières années a démontré que la nicotine est une 
drogue accoutumante. En conséquence, de nouveaux règlements en matière de produits 
du tabac sont nécessaires. Le gouvernement se doit de classer les cigarettes dans la 
catégorie des drogues. Cela faciliterait les efforts de réduction des effets néfastes du 
tabagisme, particulièrement chez les enfants et les jeunes», conclut le Dr Kendall.<P>

At this writing, psychiatrists have been the only professionals dealing with alcoholism in 
developing countries.  Primary involvement in treatment; secondary, in research.  Psychiatry is a 
new, not-understood profession.  Much ignorance of alcoholism.  Psychiatrists should raise 
awareness of alcoholism among other medical professionals, in the community, and in 
government.  Epidemiological research is needed to demonstrate need for services.  
Cooperation with international intergovernmental and NGO agencies essential.<P>

Emphasises importance of sound research to policy and programme development, 
especially in countries where resources are limited.  Case in point is cannabis-related psychosis.  
Next: khat use in East Africa.  Also amphetamines, sedatives, opioids.  How dependence 
develops, is uncovered, and controlled.  Note that cocaine and heroin have begun to be used 
locally, byproducts of Nigeria being used as a transit point for product to Europe and North 
America.  Reemphasizes in-patient treatment, involuntary commital, detoxification within the 
treatment regimen, and opposition to methadone maintenance in Africa.<P>

One important social function of scientific research is to provide decision makers with an 
explicitly structured rational basis for policies they would tend to make.  A prerequisite for any 
programme, irrespective of its substantive content, whether firected towards one particular 
service, or intended to manipulate the drug situation as presenting in the community as a whole, 
is to have some kind of assessment of the main dimensions of the problem.  Assessment of 
dependence-producing potential of a drug is an area where epidemiology presents an important 
approach.  Applied exploitation of functional relationships uncovered through epidemiological 
research is a third area to be emphasized.  Utilization of some descriptive findings at their face 
validity.  More epidemiological research should be encouraged to explore areas that are still 
relatively untrodden.  Examples: health problems associated with drug abuse among pregnant 
women; the role of different psychosocial variables in moderating long-term drug effects; and 
factors associated with the nontaking of drugs.<P>

Apart from cannabis abuse in northern and southern Africa and khat chewing in northeastern 
Africa, the history of drug abuse in Africa is relatively short.  The abuse of drugs in Africa is 
nevertheless escalating rapidly from cannabis abuse to the more dangerous drugs and from 
limited groups of drug users to a wider range of people abusing drugs.  The most common and 
available drug of abuse is still cannabis, which is known to be a contributing factor to the 
occurrence of a schizophrenic-like psychosis.  The trafficking in and abuse of cocaine and heroin 
are the most recent developments in some African countries that had had no previous 
experience with these drugs.  Efforts should be made to design and implement drug abuse 
assessment programmes to determine the real magnitude and characteristics of the problem and 
to monitor its trends.  A lack of funds and a shortage of adequatly trained personnel have made 
it difficult to implement drug abuse control programmes.  In addition to formal drug control 
involving the implementation of legislation, there is an informal system of drug abuse control 
operating through the family, church, school, neighbourhood, and work environment, as well as 
healthy recreational activities.  It is suggested that efforts in African countries should be directed 
towards strengthening not only the formal drug control system but also informal control in order 
to compensate for the insufficient funds and the shortage of personnel trained in implementing 
formal drug control measures.  It is very likely that the drug problems in African countries will 
worsen in future unless more effective measures are implemented to arrest the current 
situation.<P>

Main focal points:  (1) A historical review of the liquor trade.  (2) An account of the 
international conferences convened to devise its control and the work of the League of Nations 
body which came to supervise such control.  (3) A sketch of the local circumstances and 
consequences of alcohol control in three of the African territories themselves. Alcohol was used 
as currency for many transactions, first in the 18th century slave trade, then in the 19th century 
palm oil trade.  In one case, an African king gave sovereignty over his kingdom to France for a 
pittance in trade goods, including four cases of liquor.  European missionary activity led to 
agitation against the liquor trade; the missionaries were seconded by colonists exploiting African 
labor.  Nonetheless, trade persisted until after WW1.  Heavy drinking condoned among 
European colonists.  The French and German governments established separate colonies in 
West Africa for alcohol producers in their countries, primarily to allow those producers to escape 
English colonial tariffs.  Alcohol revenues provided crucial means of repatriating profits from 
colonial investments; impaired trade during WW1 and reductions after the St. Germain 
Convention (1920) vastly reduced profitability of colonies.  Home brews indigenous across the 
continent, but distillation was introduced by Europeans.  In cultural history, most drinking was as 
social lubricant, not for intoxication; outward drunkenness was considered shameful.  Indigenous 
beers and wines have 3-7% alcohol content; imported distilled liquor, 45-50%.  Islam and some 
mission churches were sobering influences in cultural development.<A NAME = here></A><P>

There are signs that the traditional patterns of drug abuse in Egypt are changing.  Cannabis 
continues to be the main recreational drug, and the abuse of alcohol is uncommon.  Opium 
dependence remains largely confined to middle-aged opium-eating men from the lower 
socioeconomic groups, and, despite the increased production of opium in Egypt, there are as yet 
no notable changes in prevalence or in the characteristics of users.  However, in the past three 
years in Cairo, there has been a marked increase in the abuse of synthetic drugs such as 
methaqualone and amphetamines.  the increase in the number of persons using drugs by 
injection and the involvement of a younger age group in this type of drug abuse may portend the 
development of an urban epidemic of adolescent drug abuse.  There is clearly a need for 
continued and careful monitoring of this type of drug abuse and there are implications also for 
the planning of treatment services and preventive measures.<P>

This paper reports on the construction and administration of a standardized interviewing 
schedule, comprising about 240 items, to two groups of cannabis takers from the city of Cairo 
(204 Ss) and from Upper Egypt (49 Ss) and to two control groups (115 and 40 Ss respectively).  
To estimate the reliability of the schedule the retake method was followed and most of the item 
reliabilities were found satisfactory.  Items with low reliabilities were dropped from the analysis.  
As to validity, a number of methods were utilized.  A number of variables could reliably be 
established as meaningfully related to hashish consumption as practiced by Egyptian users.  The 
utilization of a control group helped obtain unequivocally meaningful results.  Methods of hashish 
use were described.  Volume of consumption and some correlates were specified.  The peak age 
for commencing the habit was found to lie between 16 and 18 years.  Main motives for starting to 
take the drug were the following: conformity to a group of friends; euphoria; curiosity; and trying 
to appear like "real men."  The motives for resuming the habit after interruption were mainly two: 
conformity to a group of old fellow-users; and trying to forget about one's personal problems.  A 
number of discrepancies between urban and rural Ss emerged in this area.  The structure of the 
group gathering for taking hashish was described and the personality characteristics of the group 
leader were specified.  Experiments and controls were compared with respect to socialization 
variables and personality traits.  A family history of the habit was more prevalent among 
experimentals.  They were more neglected by their fathers and more exposed to interparental 
conflict than controls.  Hashish takers were also more anxious than non-hashish takers.  No 
significant differences were found between the two groups in ascendancy, impulsiveness, 
suggestibility, or social shyness.  Temporary changes in a number of personality characteristics 
and cognitive functions under drug effect were specified.  Changes in personality traits when Ss 
felt deprived of the drug were also specified.  Productivity deteriorated when Ss were drugged 
and when they were craving for the drug.  Correlational analysis revealed a number of 
psychological variables contributing to this deterioration.<P>

This paper reports on the results of interviewing and testing 850 Egyptian cannabis takers 
and 839 controls all being male prison inmates.  Two standardized interviewing schedules, one 
for experimentals and one for controls, were administered to the respective groups together with 
16 objective test variables, speed and accuracy of psychomotor performance, initial reaction 
time, immediate memory, visuo-motor coordination, and time and length estimation.  Smoking 
was found to be the prevalent method of cannabis use.  The majority of hashish takers use the 
drug in the evening.  Most of the habitués use hashish in groups, yet more urban than rural 
dwellers are lone users.  Frequency of drug taking per month and of attempts at interruption of 
hashish use was found to be related to age at onset of the habit; the earlier the onset, the higher 
the frequency of drug taking and the fewer the attempts at interruption.  Comparison of heavy 
takers with moderates revealed the following: incidence of divorce was more frequent among the 
former than the latter; fewer attempts at interrupting hashish use were reported by heavy takers; 
more heavy takers than moderates take opium, alcohol, and coffee; more heavy takers than 
moderates stick to smoking as the preferred way for hashish use; more heavy takers than 
moderates take cannabis in the daytime as well as in the evening.  A positive relationship could 
be established between duration of hashish use and opium taking.  Early onset of regular 
cannabis consumption was found to be associated with exposure to influence of a drug-taking 
person as an example within the family circle, combined with the effect of the disappearance of 
father or mother, and the intrusion of a stepparent.  Regarding frequency of criminal offences, 
other than those dealing with pushing and/or taking narcotics, hashish takers were found to have 
a significantly lower record than controls.  Controls scored significantly better than hashish takers 
on most of the objective tests.  Only on Time Estimation did experimentals earn consistently 
better scores than controls.  The differences between hashish takers and controls on objective 
tests were positively correlated to the level of education of the comparable groups; the higher 
their educational achievement, the larger the discrepancies.<P>

The present paper reports on an epidemiological study of the nonmedical use of 
psychoactive substances among male secondary school students in Greater Cairo.  A 
standardized questionnaire was administered to 5530 male pupils constituting a representative 
sample of all male students in Cairo secondary schools.  The main aim of the study was to 
provide factual answers to questions pertaining to, (a) the extent of the use of psychoactive 
drugs, and (b) the etiology of such use among secondary school students.  Methodological steps 
undertaken to provide for representativeness of the sample and credibility of the tool are 
described.  Among the interesting results were the following: (1) consistently more arts students 
than pupils reading science and maths were immersed in the drug culture; (2) sizable numbers of 
young people get exposed to the drug culture through well-defined psychosocial channels; (3) 
the role of mass media in effecting this exposure seems to be quite serious, ranking in most 
cases after the role of personal friends; (4) a differrentiation between 'activists' and 'passivists' 
among subjects who 'ever used' drugs seems to be important in understanding more about drug 
use phenomena; and (5) some findings add a new dimension to the operational definition of high 
risk groups: a subgroup of nonusers could be labeled 'potential users.'<P>

This is the second of a series of studies planned to explore the epidemiology of nonmedical 
use of drugs among Egyptian youth.  A standardized questionnaire with well-established 
reliability and validity estimates was administered to a representative sample of technical school 
students in Greater Cairo, numbering 3686 male pupils.  The questionnaire was designed to shed 
light on the extent of use of nonmedical drugs plus the etiology of such use.  Among the 
interesting findings are the following:  About 5% of the students tried at least one type of 
synthetic drugs.  Slightly over 11% tried narcotics and 33% used alcohol at least once.  In all 
cases of 'ever using' drugs, those who stopped the practice were mainly motivated by fear of 
expected physical as well as psychological harm.  An attempt was made to shed light on 
psychosocial factors contributing to the actual initiation of drug use as well as to being prone to 
such use.<P>

The current work is part of a series of epidemiological studies on the extent and patterns of 
the nonmedical use of psychoactive substances by significant sectors of the Egyptian population.  
A standardized interviewing schedule was especially constructed for the present survey, and 
item retake reliabilities were established.  The interview was conducted on 5108 men working in 
the manufacturing industries.  Findings are discussed and comparisons made between these 
results and the corresponding data obtained in our previous investigations on other sectors of the 
society.  Egyptian industrial workers, compared with male university students, seem to have a 
rather late age of onset of drug use and to go for natural narcotics rather than prescription 
psychotropic drugs and alcohol.  Many more workers than students take alcohol as an analgesic.  
There were, however, a number of commonalities among workers and various types of students 
concerning drug-related behavior.<P>

Major drug problems are outside Africa, but international contacts might change that.  
Identifying drugs being abused by an individual.  Primary drug of current abuse in region is 
cannabis.  Barbiturates, amphetamines, and tranquillizers being misused somewhat; 
hallucinogens unknown.  No treatment facilities; such facilities would have little relevance to 
cannabis abusers.  Economic, social development likely to mitigate cannabis abuse problems, 
but might produce substitution with alcohol or other drugs.  There is not universal acceptance of 
international narcotics treaties in East Africa, nor is national narcotics enforcement administered 
uniformlysometimes, not at all.  The main stream of illicit traffic in opium, hashish, and the 
white drugs does not at present touch the East African region; the illicit traffic is mainly in 
cannabis locally produced, though in some cases there is an export of cannabis across frontiers 
within the region.  Drug penalties vary within the region.  No evidence that organized gangs are 
conducting the cannabis traffic in the area.  There is no exchange of drug-trafficking information 
within the region.  Law enforcement training, assistance needed.<P>

Restriction of drug cultivation may affect peasant economies.  Prohibition of drugs of 
longstanding indigenous use may prove futile.  In Africa, drug addiction and illicit trafficking in 
narcotics do not, at this stage, constitute a very significant problem; and we are fortunate in not 
having any pernicious abuse of drugs.  In spite of some degree of alcoholism and some abuse of 
cannabis in some countries in this region, we are yet far from the crisis through which other 
regions of the world are passing.  Why is the problem not yet acute in our African countries?  
Could it be that things are currently happening, of which we are not yet aware but which are bring 
us closer to it?  Africa's encounter with the 20th century is bringing us many boons; it will also 
bring us some woe.  It is possible that as the tensions of industrialization and economic 
development increase, other social problems, such as drug abuse, may come to the fore.

Rapid economic development in the 60s and 70s led to rapid expansion of cities and towns.  
Major agricultural projects quickly transformed rural areas into small towns.  The resulting urban 
migration brought disorganization and social change.  Traditional lifestyles, cultural influences, 
and family ties weakened.  Alcohol consumption increased markedly at all levels, and patterns of 
drinking changed completely, especially in rural areas.<P>

While no detailed study on use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs has been done in this 
country to date, preliminary investigations strongly indicate that the problem is widespread.  The 
major drugs of abuse are alcohol, cannabis (bhang), miraa (catha edulis, or khat), and 
tranquilizers.  Although alcoholism is more prevalent in adults, cannabis use is most widespread 
among the youth.  Miraa chewing is confined to a section of the community that does not 
normally drink alcohol.  Tranquilizers are being abused more by the more educated.  Detailed 
research into the problem is urgently needed.<P>

of drugs and alcohol by secondary school students in Kenya.  Out of 4450 students requested to 
complete the questionnaire, 2870 (63%) responded.  The results confirm the anecdotal reports 
that drug abuse may be prevalent among these groups.  It is recommended that a more detailed 
study should be carried out, not only to establish the prevalence, but also to investigate possible 
causes, attitudes of the students, their parents, and the community towards drug abuse with a 
view of identifying preventive measures.<P>

Alcoholism is now recognized all overr the world as a major health and socioeconomic 
problem.  Although exact figures on prevalence remain unknown in this country, several studies 
done in recent years strongly indicate that use and abuse of alcohol is very widespread.  As in 
many other developing countries, the problem is currently being handled almost solely by 
psychiatrists and other mental health workers, who are few in number compared with cases 
requiring treatment.  This is despite the fact that it has been shown that once detection of 
alcoholics has been made, treatment can be carried out equally well in most cases by general 
practitioners, social workers, and nonmedical personnel such as Alcoholics Anonymous.  In a 
country like Kenya, where the number of general practitioners is relatively large compared with 
psychiatrists, involvement of general practitioners in the treatment of alcoholism would be a 
positive step towards combating the disease.  It was with foregoing in mind that this preliminary 
study was undertaken.  The first objective was to find out how much doctors practicing in Nairobi 
knew about alcoholism and problems associated with the use of alcohol, steps which they 
considered could reduce the problem, if it was significant.<P>

people were interviewed on knowledge, attitude, and practice of alcoholism and alcohol-related 
problems.  140 people who admitted ever having drunk alcohol were subjected to a screening 
questionnaire for alcoholics.  Fifty of them were diagnosed as alcoholics.  There were 26 females 
and 24 males of ages 15 years upwards.  From the sample, 84% gave histories of at least one 
family member drinking alcohol and 32% of the homes brewed alcohol.  A high prevalence of 
alcoholism was found in the district, affecting 23.6% of the female and 26.6% of the male

Addiction a fairly recent phenomenon; relatively unknown before WW2, now widespread 
throughout Africa.  Relation to impairment of mature, responsible adjustment to family, social, 
and vocational problems.  Cannabis #1 drug of abuse; smoked in cigarettes.  Notes 7 cases in 
recent years of Nigerian medical personnel treated for pethidine dependence.  Amphetamine, 
barbiturate abuse incidence rising among students.  Alcohol abuse common in cities among 
lower socioeconomic strata.  <I>Apart from these cases, true addiction does not occur in the 
indigenous population of Africa.</I>  ". . . drug addiction strictly speaking is uncommon among 
primitive Africans, and where it is found (in the primitive setting) it is usually associated with 
ritualistic orgies."  Chronic cannabis abusers do not exhibit classic symptoms of dependence: 
continued presence needed for normal functioning, compulsive use of increasing doses, 
abstinence syndrome upon withdrawal of drug.  Operational criteria based on degree of 
impairment.  Various studies demonstrate reasons for incidence differences in different locales, 
based on effects of urban migration and the socioeconomic circumstances leading to increased 
exposure.  Drug addiction may reflect a response to the disintegration of the traditionally 
supported kinship groups giving rise to social isolation and economic deprivation.  Incidence is 
higher among young migrant workers, bachelors, and polygamous men.  Incidence very low 
among women; related mostly to stresses of urbanization (e.g. prostitution).  In 4 of 5 survey 
cities, 85-95% of cannabis addicts treated were from lower third socioeconomic strata.  Half of 
patients were under 25 and had used for 3-5 years.  Personality characteristics, social life of 
chronic hemp smokers in W. Africa considered.  Western psychotherapeutic methods, models 
considered irrelevant (at least in detail) to Africans because developed in different cultural 
setting.  Chlorpromazine (an antipsychotic tranquillizer) used to "treat" chronic, heavy cannabis 
users.  Psychiatric disorders of chronic cannabis users in Nigeria: disorders of behaviour and 
character [including crime, sexual promiscuity, violence] (29.3%), schizophreniform disorders 
(25%), symptomatic disorders (20.2%), psychoneurosis (13.5%), three others (12%).  Ages: 
under 30 (55%), 30-49 (35%), 50-69 (10%).  Crimes and offences in W. Africa in which cannabis 
was a factor were fourth on the list between 1962 and 1963.  Number of cannabis traffickers 
doubles yearly.  Addiction should not be considered a disease, though drug-using behavior 
usually is.  To manage the addiction problem in Africa: track the disease; institutional treatment; 
health and civic education; legal measures.  Unlike pethidine addiction, many cannabis users 
can be treated on an out-patient basis.  At this writing, there are no effective legal measures 
against addictioneither control or preventionin either West or East Africa.<P>

Summary of 1987 Francophone West African symposium on drug abuse.  Participants from 
health, social action, judicial and correctional administration, sociology, and journalism 
professions.  Multiple sponsorship, including ICAA and UNFDAC.  Fifteen nations participated.  
Session on the classification of drugs for practical and legal (international treaty) purposes.  
Session asking, what is addiction?  Session on the effects of cannabis.  Session on the effects of 
psychotropic medications (tranquillizers, hypnotics, analgesics, stimulants, hallucinogens).  On 
alcohol's effects.  On sociocultural factors.  Treatment issues addressed.  In Côte d'Ivoire, 
cannabis abused by the young, alcohol among older people, and some use of barbiturates, 
amphetamines, solvents.  Comparison of psychological treatment to family- and community-
oriented approach.  Need for addiction education as part of overall public health program.  
Smaller groups focussed on more specific issues (the region's drug problem, why drug problems 
arise, social and family consequences, etc.).  The second week of the course focussed on the 
formation of the individual, family, and community therapeutic relation.  Finally, a film was 
shown that had been made in the Côte d'Ivoire, "I Choose Life."  The symposium slogan: "Drugs, 
a global phenomenon, require a universal search for international solutions."<P>

ne reconnaissent pas toujours la même clientèle.  Les amphétamines ont le suffrage des 
étudiants: lycéens et collégiens devant affronter un effort soutenu mais limité dans le temps.  On 
comprend cette habitude lorsqu'on se rappelle notre civilisation de la vie.  Chez nous en effet, 
tous les phénomènes de la vie: maladie, mort, guérison, réussite . . . etc. sont le fait de forces 
extérieures à l'individu.  On a réussi parce qu'on a su se concilier les grâces des esprits.  Mais 
voilà que ces substances pharmaceutiques peuvent aider dans l'effort en retardant la fatigue et 
le sommeil.  On les sollicite pour forcer la décison.  Seuls les comprimés sont utilisés et 
seulement par les garçons et à l'approche des examens.  Les premiers signes d'intolérance 
entrainent un abandon du produit.  On recherche alors l'aide du médecin après les guérisseurs.  
Un seul cas de chronicité, motivé il est vrai, par d'autres considérations.  Le cannabisme nous 
introduit, quant à lui, dans le cercle de la vraie toxicomanie avec ses motivations et ses rituels.  
Les clients sont des jeunes gens, de sexe masculin, qui souffrent de perturbation du milieu 
familial.  Enfants naturels ou abandonnés, enfants affligés de complexes divers qui voudraient 
se hisser au niveau de leurs camarades.  Ils recherchent la compagnie et rencontrent quelqu'un 
qui leur propose l'expérience de la cigarette.  Le cannabisme ne trouve pas de justification dans 
le contexte culturel de ce pays.  Le peuple Ivoirien nést pas du tout porté à la contemplation.  
C'est donc une pratique introduite ici par des Etrangers.  Aussi suit-elle l'évolution de la mode 
internationale.  Ainsi assistons-nous au passage de la cigarette de feuilles exclusives à la 
cigarette composée (feuilles et graines).  Mais on reste toujours attaché à la cigarette en 
ignorant l'emploi de la résine qui nécessite du matériel dont le prix rebute les amateurs 
éventuels.  C'est aussi les mobiles financiers qui barrent encore la route aux drogues fortes.  Le 
chanvre indien est recherché comme un moyen d'évasion ou d'affirmation de soi.  Son usage 
tend à se pérenniser.  A ce titre, il représente un danger plus grand car il peut déboucher sur les 
drogues majeures.  Cependant, c'est aussi contre le chanvre qu'un programme de lutte est 
concevable.<P>

Observations were made for a period of three years (1974-77) on 462 Ghanaian university 
and secondary school students, aged 15 to 27, who had drug problems.  O fthe 462 cases, only 8 
(1.73%) were females.  The results showed an increase in the number of reported drug cases 
from 1974 to 1977.  The majority of the students had relatively high socioeconomic backgrounds.  
Polydrug abuse in combination with alcohol was the popular trend, influenced by contact with 
Western values.  Treatment including supportive therapy was encouraging.<P>

A survey of drug use, based on a sample of 990 students in their fourth and final year of 
secondary school in the Abeokuta local government area of the State of Ogun in Nigeria was 
conducted by means of a self-report drug-use questionnaire in September 1986.  There were 534 
male and 377 female respondents.  Their mean age was 16.4 and the majority (89%) were from 
the lower or middle socioeconomic levels.  The most commonly used drugs were salicylate 
analgesics, mild stimulants, alcohol, antibiotics, and diazepam [Valium].  Low use was recorded 
for barbiturates, cannabis, organic solvents, and cocaine, and there was no reported use of 
narcotic analgesics or hallucinogens.  Females used diazepam [Valium] significantly more than 
males.  Most users had their first contact with drugs in primary school.  The author stressed the 
need to develop a vialbe drug-abuse preventive programme and a comprehensive data base in 
Ogun.<P>

The views and knowledge level of 135 randomly selected secondary school teachers in the 
Abeokuta Local Government Area of Ogun State in Nigeria on drug abuse were sought through a 
self-report anonymous questionnaire.  The respondents were mostly male (59.3%) under the age 
of thirty years (89.6%).  The majority (59.3%) were never exposed to drug education as students 
while less than 20% have been exposed since qualifying as teachers.  Although the majority had 
a good concept of the definition of drug abuse, their views on the potential drugs of abuse and 
the concept of "drug dependence" were inadequate.  85.9% chose "guidance counselling" as the 
approach to the management of student drug abusers despite the dearth of this professional 
cadre in the schools.  The authors gave suggestions on the pattern and content of teacher-
targeted formal drug education program in light of the findings.<P>

Drug abuse has become a topical issue in Nigeria, particularly within the past decade, with 
the increasing involvement of youths and the incursion of hard drugs.  The paper addresses the 
general aspects of basic definitions, consequences of abuse, and possible causative factors.  
With particular reference to Nigeria, it examines the historical perspective and the changing 
trends.  It also attempts a forecast on future trends, critically examines the impact of 
governmental control efforts, and puts forward a few suggestions towards achieving a better 
control.<P>

This paper presents the results of two studies on drug abuse carried out among young 
people.  One study included a sample of 2,846 pupils from 17 secondary schools in Lagos, the 
other 300 patients admitted to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital for treatment of drug 
abuse.  Among the secondary school students the major substances used were alcohol, 
barbiturates, central nervous system stimulants, tobacco, Mandrax [methaqualone, or Quaalude], 
and cannabis.  The majority of hospital patients treated for drug abuse were cannabis users.<P>

Begins with generalities on differences between alcoholism in Africa and in the West.  Actual 
research based entirely on a study of the 60 psychiatric patients with alcoholic problems at the 
Aro Neuropsychiatric Hospital between 1964 and 1973.  Admissions rose steadily each year.  
95% male.  63.3% between 20 and 40 years old.  Only 28.3% engaged in "traditional 
occupations."  63.3% Christian, 31.7% Moslem.  18.3% mixed alcohol and cannabis use.  61.7% 
admitted because of drinking patterns, 36.7% for alcoholic impairment.  Treatment described.  
Treatment is exclusively in-patient.  Discharge after three months abstinence; relapse during 
hospitalization increases length of stay.  61.7% of discharged patients could not be followed up 
on.  Description of other drugs of dependence:  Pethidine [meperidine, a synthetic narcotic 
analgesic, sedative, and antispasmodic], by medical professionals.  Amphetamines by students 
for studying, by workers and peasants for endurance.  Amphetamines known as Lagos or 
Nigerian tablets in other West African countries, possibly because they get into those countries 
through Nigeria or Nigerians.  Mandrax [Quaalude] by students and soldiers for parties.  
Importation of Mandrax has ceased.  Marijuana is widely abused.  Heroin and cocaine hardly 
used at all.<P>

More on Aro Hospital: 100-150 outpatient clients daily, 100-120 beds in open unit, 300-400 
beds in closed unit (an old prison).  In 1974, 18 treated for psychiatric disorders associated with 
drug abuseall male, 4 readmissions, average age 21 (16-35 years old).  Nigeria has a tolerant, 
permissive social system.  Drug control is weak, and marijuana grows readily.  Principal drug of 
abuse is marijuana, followed by amphetamines, barbiturates, and pethidine.  There are no 
specifically designated addiction treatment programs; psychiatric services are general and 
include the treatment of drug abuse.  There are 30 registered psychiatrists in Nigeria at 15 
facilities: 6 university teaching hospitals, six government psychiatric hospitals, three military 
hospital psychiatric service centers.  Treatment:  In-patient detox; psychotic or other withdrawal 
reaction treated with drugs and electroconvulsive therapy.  Superficial psychotherapy is given 
and family therapy is undertaken where indicated and applicable.<P>

Traditional drug use briefly described: alcohol on ceremonial occasions and in religious 
rituals; Kola nuts (in the north); smoked tobacco in clay pipes by older men and women; some 
holding of shredded tobacco leaves or chewed Kola nuts in the mouth.  Today, alcohol use 
growing hugely.  Recap of amphetamine, barbiturate, pethidine use.  Mandrax [Quaalude] use 
almost eliminated since being withdrawn from market.  LSD, heroin, morphine use practically 
unknown.  Cannabis most common drug of dependence [before alcohol?].  Cannabis not native; 
introduced to Nigeria during and after WW2; smoked; not used for fiber.  Treatment described.  
Exclusively in-patient.  Involuntary admissions sometimes used.  "Cold turkey" withdrawal.  
Individual and group psychotherapy.  Discharged after not less than 6 weeks abstinence, with 
scripts for anxiolytic drugs.  Drug substitution (methadone) not advocated because of long-term 
maintenance expense.  Patient follow-up not possible at time.  Federal government proposing to 
set up drug dependence units all over the country, which might facilitate readier follow-up.  
Unclear role of traditional healers in addiction treatment.  Legislative, government control efforts 
increasing.  <I>Conclusion:</I>  Drug dependence is not of the same magnitude in Nigeria as it 
is in some other countries.  There is, however, evidence that it will increase with increasing 
affluence, disintegration of the family and other cultural systems which have had a supportive 
and restraining influence on the individual.<P>

The questionnaire devised by WHO as a standardized instrument for use across cultures, 
and modified to suit an African culture, was completed by 104 clinical medical students (male 
and female) selected at random.  After statistical analysis, the results were discussed regarding 
attitudes (approval/disapproval); perceived availability; social connotation; perceived 
harmfulness; perceived problems; perceived parental norms; religion, and exposure to use.  A 
significant finding was that 78% of the medical students disapprove of people using all the listed 
drugs, 11% disapprove slightly, and only 11% do not disapprove.<P>

This paper surveys the literature on drug abuse in Nigeria and attempts to delineate some 
sociocultural aspects of the problem of drug abuse frequently reported in Nigeria.  Changing 
patterns in age and sex showed that drug abuse now starts at an early age and sex variation 
depends on the substance of abuse.  Girls tend to abuse hypnosedatives more than boys, while 
the reverse is the case for stimulants.  Regarding occupation and social class there are some 
changing patterns.  Cultural changes have been attributed to the civil war, industrialization, rapid 
urbanization, and increased exposure to the West.  It is hoped that this presentation will generate 
interest in the study of sociocultural factors in drug abuse aimed at suggesting guidelines for 
preventive programmes.<P>

Using a structured pro forma, 728 out of 775 medical undergraduates at a Nigerian university 
were surveyed for the prevalence and pattern of drug use.  An operational definition of 
substance abuse was made, and 28% of students fell within that criterion.  Male abusers (81%) 
exceeded female abusers (19%).  Substances most commonly absued were alcohol (60%), 
minor tranquilizers (48%), tobacoo (35%), and narcotics (29%), particularly codeine.  Only 11% 
abused cannabis.  While most students were polydrug users, there was a low frequency of daily 
drug use.  A general lifetime (occasional use) prevalence of substance use of 56% was found.  
Drugs consumed on a daily basis were alcohol (2%) and tobacco (6%).  The prevalence of drug 
use was highest among the fourth and final year students.  The majority of students were 
occasional abusers; there was no evidence of physical dependence.<P>

In a survey of Nigerian undergraduate medical students, alcohol and drug users were 
classified as frequent users, causal users, and nonusers.  Place of residence during session and 
family structure recorded no significant contribution to the development of substance abuse.  
Male sex, poor performance on examinations, drug taking among close friends and peers, and a 
family background of lower socioeconomic status emerged as sociodemographic factors 
correlating positively with the presence of substance abuse.  Health education, controlled 
distribution of drugs and alcohol, stringent regulatory provisions against their use, and a 
permanent Commission on Substance Abuse with full judicial powers are suggested as 
measures that may help control the abuse of psychoactive substances and the hazard they pose 
to public health.<P>

first-year experience reported.  During this period, the 52 patients admitted were mostly single, 
employed, and educated, at lest to primary school leaving certificate level.  Most were students 
and vehicle drivers, but some other occupational groups were represented.  They were referred 
for treatment by hospital doctors and relatives.  Cannabis and alcohol were the two most 
commonly abused substances.  As many as a quarter of the patients, mostly the cannabis 
abusers, presented with psychiatric symptoms.  The prescribed specialized treatment is for 8 
weeks, but many stayed longer due to difficulties with arranging their rehabilitation and 
aftercare.<P>

Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa, is experiencing a growing problem of drug abuse 
and drug trafficking.  The problem started with Indian hemp (cannabis) in the 1960s, but by the 
early 1980s, cocaine and heroin had entered the scene as the country became a transshipment 
route for drugs meant for Europe and North America.  While cannabis and alcohol are still the 
most widely abused drugs today, and they contribute more to ill health than any other drug, the 
abuse of cocaine and heroin is on the rise.  Lifetime use rates of cocaine and heroin/morphine 
are 1.6% and 2.3% respectively among university students, and 0.8% and 0.2% in the general 
population.  About 50% of both students and adults drink alcohol regularly; 1.3% of students and 
2.4% of the general population smoke Indian hemp.  The abuse of a wide variety of other 
drugssuch as inhalants, central nervous system stimulants, hallucinogens, and prescription 
drugshas also been reported.  The health and social problems associated with drug abuse are 
increasing; drug abuse accounted for 9.1% of admissions into four psychiatric hospitals in 1984 
and 15.1% in 1988.  In response to the worsening drug situation, a national drug control agency 
has been set up with predominantly law enforcement functions.  There is an urgent need for 
coordinated demand reduction activities, including a program of regular national epidemiologic 
surveys.<P>

Since prevention cannot be planned in isolation from a nation's drug policy, the article 
considered along with prevention strategies some of the plans made by the Nigerian government 
to prevent drug addiction and alcoholism.  The article considered the target population for 
primary prevention as individuals-at-risk groups, mostly teenagers and jeopardized individuals 
who are users-at-high-risk groups.  The Greek origin of aggressive prevention, "prophylaxis," is 
encouraged.  Methods considered effective through practice were listed: education, persuasive 
counselling, prevention of psychoneurotic disorders related to anxiety reactions, and parental 
education.<P>

Earlier studies on alcohol use in Nigeria identified young and middle-aged male adults as 
mainly concernec.  In the last decade, however, there has been a noticeable trend of youths 
getting more and more involved in alcohol use.  Some of these latter studies, apart from 
indicating the increasing involvement of the female sex, have also shown various pathologies 
associated with alcohol use in Nigeria youths.  Most of these reports only looked at alcohol use in 
the broader context of drug and alcohol abuse in the Nigerian society.  However, in the present 
cross-sectional study of drug use involving 2079 senior secondary school students in two major 
cities of Nigeria (Ibadan and Abeokuta), prevalence rates of alcohol use was 56% for Ibadan and 
51.5% for Abeokuta.  The male/female ratio fo the users was 11:10 in Ibadan and 12:10 in 
Abeokuta.  Males used alcohol significantly more than females in each of the two cities <I>(P</I> 
&lt  0.025).  Alcohol use was found more common among younger students in the lower school 
classes and also among those from higher and medium socioeconomic background.  Among 
contributing factors were parental deprivation and delinquency.  Alcohol users were also found to 
be more involved in accidents and the use of other psychoactive drugs than nonusers.<P>

In a review of the studies on alcohol use in Nigeria, evidence shows that within the last 
decade there has been a rapid increase in alcohol availability (production/importation) and 
alcohol consumption.  Similarly, the literature on the subject reveals an increasing trend in 
alcohol-related psychosocial and physical health hazards.  This observation prompted a review 
of the existing alcohol treatment methods in Nigeria.  These treatment methods include: 
traditional healers' approach, syncretic churches, government hospitals including a specialised 
drug addiction centre, and voluntary agencies.  Suggestions are made on how to improve alcohol 
treatment systems and data collection in Nigeria.<P>

The past 15 years of published literature on the use/misuse of nonprescription psychoactive 
substances in Nigeria was reviewed.  It was found that alcohol, tobacco products, cannabis, and 
stimulants are more frequently used than other substances.  More males than females, more 
single than married persons, and more urban than rural residents use the substances.  As a 
result of insufficient information, it could not be established who uses the substances more 
among different age, religious, social class, educational, and occupational categories.  The 
incidence of substance misuse could not be established precisely because most of the authors 
did not clearly distinguish substance use from substance misuse.  However, a low incidence of 
chemical dependency was established.  Improved research methodology was suggested as a 
way of obtaining better results in the future.<P>

Interviews were carried out with 35 drug abusers admitted to the psychiatric ward of the 
University of Benin Teach Hospital, Nigeria.  Data analysed included age, sex, family 
constellation, education, birth order, age, and circumstances of first drug use.  The majority of 
drug abusers were from polygamous homes and fairly large family backgrounds.  In cases where 
drug abusers were from monogamous homes, they were later born.  Initial drug use was usually 
a social experience with considerable peer group influence and began with either prescribed 
drugs or marijuana.  Although most had tried to stop drug abuse, they reported lack of support 
from relatives, and getting used to aversive drugs.<P>

This paper reviews the available literature on the epidemiology of drug abuse in Nigeria.  
Depending on the definition used, substances which are abused include antibiotics, 
antidiarrhoeals, laxatives, pain-relieving drugs, sedatives, amphetamines, and cannabis.  This 
review is, however, limited to studies on substances which alter behaviour or mood.  These 
drugs include cannabis, sedative-hypnotics, amphetamines, and alcohol.  For some classes of 
drugs, there has been a noticeable shift in patterns of drug abusefor example, from abuse of 
methaqualone [Quaalude] to barbiturates.  The abuse of volatile solvents and other substances 
has also been noted.  The review shows that there is no age limit among drug abusers.  Studies 
on the influence of social class have been contradictory.  Factors which indicate a predisposition 
to initial drug use have been similar to those reported in other cultures.  Although the studies 
agreed on the classes of drugs abused and the changing patterns of drug abuse, there has been 
no uniform reporting system.  This situation is attributed to financial constraints.  Large-scale 
surveys which should incorporate most of the core items in any epidemiological study on 
substance abuse have been suggested.<P>

This paper provides an operational definition and lists some psychosocial questions usually 
asked about drug dependence.  It then reviews the literature on drug abuse in Nigeria, extracting 
some of the psychosocial variables involved.  The review indicates that drug abuse is associated 
with polygamous or large monogamous families, which may be suggestive of "stressful sibling 
rivalry."  Other factors included defiance of or rebellion against parental control, the facilitation of 
social intercourse, and harmful early childhood experiences.  The social factors implicated 
include urbanization, Westernization, and migration which may weaken the traditional African 
support system.  An important outgrowth of the review is that the psychosocial variables 
implicated are not different from those observed in other cultures.  However, an important social 
dimension is the prescribing and dispensing practices of Nigerian medical doctors and 
pharmacists which encourage drug abuse.<P>

Study attempted to examine the pattern of drug use among 400 undergraduate students at 
the College of Education (Iyaro, Benin City, Nigeria), assess their attitudes toward drug use, and 
examine their perception of drug harmfulness to the body and to society.  Prescription use: 
analgesics (11.3%), sedatives (9.3%), antipsychotics [chlorpromazine] (1%).  Over-the-counter 
medication: analgesics (48%), sedatives (8.3%), antidepressants (1.8%), chlorpromazine (1%).  
Social drug use: alcohol (89.8%), caffeine (94.8%), kola nut (70%), nicotine (37%), hemp 
(10.8%), stimulants [amphetamines or massive doses of caffeine] (20.5%).  Perceived most 
harmful to society: heroin (84.8%), cocaine (84%), hemp (83%), LSD (81%), alcohol (56.3%)
nicotine, caffeine, aspirin all less than 1%.  Perceived most harmful to biological organism: 
cocaine (94.5%), heroin (92.3%), LSD (83.8%), alcohol (43.5%), hemp (34.5%)nicotine, 
caffeine, aspirin all less than 1%.  Most respondents said drugs were helpful (87%), but some 
noted harmful side effects (35%), and many expressed reluctance to use drugs except when 
absolutely necessary.<P>

The pattern of use and abuse of psychoactive substances by Nigerian adolescents is 
investigated.  Unlike previous epidemiological studies that used questionnaires to investigate 
university or postprimary school students, the present study used unobtrusive methods for data 
collection.  The observed pattern of use was not different from that found in previous research.  
Adolescents tended to use the following drugs in decreasing order of frequency: alcohol, 
cigarettes, stimulants, cannabis (Indian hemp), and sedative-hypnotics.  Polydrug use, especially 
of alcohol, stimulants, and cigarettes, is common.  The use of hard drugs was not reported in this 
study.  The implications of the findings can be appreciated only against the background of the 
known sequelae (psychological, physical, and socioeconomic) of psychoactive drug abuse.  
Finally, recommendations for controlling adolescent drug use are offered.<P>

"Attempt at a Sociocultural Approach to Drug Abuse in Senegal."  The practitioner 
psychiatrist is often confronted with the problem of drug abuse which becomes a deep concern 
both for public powers and the general populace.  Many meetings were totally or partly dedicated 
to this problem.  Following earlier research in Dakar by differrent specialists (pharmacists, 
hygienists, anthropologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, and psychologists), this article 
summarizes the different traditional ways of preparing products that may be abused and how 
indigenous social groups originally, strictly codified their legitimate use.  Today, much has 
changed along with social and economic changes: new methods of industrial preparation of 
drugs and more rapid communications.  Some statistics collected in the Fann district may give 
an idea of the extent of drug use, the social and professional groups most frequently associated 
with use, and the products most generally used.  Police regulations, customs examinations, and 
legal measures are not adequate by themselves to eliminate drug use.  Treatment and 
prevention measures are still needed, taking into account the full psychosocial and economic 
dimensions of the problem.<P>

The meaning of dagga use within changing social relations among African adolescents is 
explained.  At the moment the accumulated data indicates that dagga use among people of all 
age and race groups in Southern Africa during the pre-industrial era was not accompanied by 
dagga-related problems.  It is assumed that today's prevalent drug "abuse" by the youth results 
from their experience of who they are and the nature of the world they live in.  Research 
participants represented three generations of Africans.  Interviews were unstructured.  The 
common experience in the use of the substance among members of the three generations 
(grandparent, parent, and sibling) was normlessness, purposelessness, and powerlessness, 
accompanied by feelings of meaninglessness.  The findings of the preliminary study pose a 
challenge for the traditional role of a clinician (to reconstruct a person's life) and indicate a need 
to transform a dagga abuser's total world.<P>

<I>Re. survey:</I>  There was no case of medically observable chronic drug addictin in 
children examined at schools.  2.8% of the students who responded to the survey have tried 
marijuana.  No children had used any illicit drugs during the survey month; however, the 389 
students studied had friends who used: 468 used tobacco, 351 beer, 45 liquor, 5 marijuana, 4 
opium, 1 heroin.  7.7% of the students studied had handled a marijuana joint, 0.5% an opium 
tube, and 1% a foil-paper of heroin.  Of those who had smoked cigarettes, causes for 
experimentation were peer pressure (28 students), glamor surrounding the drug lifestyle (43), 
and curiosity (71); similar reasons were given for drug experimentation.  About 2/3s of families 
have a family dinner time.  Fathers tend to neglect their children; mothers spend more time with 
them.  Parents appear to easily accept the drinking habits of their children.  Students were not 
well informed about health consequences of abuse of various drugs.  71.8% of students prayed 
often or regularly.<P>

Examines the results of two surveys made a decade apart among high school students of 
Black, Indian, White, and Coloured background.  The initial survey showed some acceptance of 
the use of these substances among a small proportion of high school students but a high degree 
of intolerance of such use by the majority.  Over a ten-year period, the attitudes of the different 
population groups changed somewhat.  The decade represented in this study saw major changes 
in social and political conditions in South Africa.  These changes tended to reduce the 
significance of cultural factors influencing cannabis use among members of the Black 
population.  Contains cultural histories, histories of drug use.  Extensive focus on cannabis and 
alcohol use; only a couple of pages on other drugs.<P>

The drug most abused in the Republic of South Africa is cannabis (dagga, intsangu).  It is 
smoked in rolled cigarettes (zols), frequently mixed with tobacco, or in a clay pipe or by 
inhalation of fumes through water.  Although there are no accurate statistics, it is known that 
LSD, heroin, and amphetamines are being illicitly imported.  It is also known that barbiturates, 
tranquilizers, and analgesics are abused as in other countries.  Drug abusers are treated in the 
following 26 institutions: 5 state (federal) rehabilitation centers for white, coloured, and Bantu; 2 
private registered rehabilitation centers; 11 state (federal) institutions under the Department of 
Health; and 8 institutions under provincial (state) administration.  In addition, a crisis clinic is 
being operated by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions in Johannesburg, where 
special attention was given to 190 alcoholics and drug dependents during the six months ending 
on 31 July 1974.  The Abuse of Dependence-Producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centers 
Act of 1971 provides for heavy penalties for dealing in and illegal possession of drugs, but ample 
provision exists for withdrawing charges and for committal to rehabilitation centers for treatment.  
Provision, too, is made for impostion of lesser penalties or suspension of penalties in case of 
extenuating circumstances.  A multidisciplinary approach is followed in South Africa in the 
treatment of drug abuse patients.  Treatment is undertaken by the state and state-aided 
institutions, such as church-oriented bodies and otherr welfare organizations.  Detoxification is 
carried out and psychiatric treatment is employed, with preventative measures and information 
services available.  Research is carried out by the South African Medical Research Council and 
Human Research Council into every aspect of drug abuse, prevention, treatment, and 
rehabilitation.  In summary, the treatment of the drug abuser and drug dependent includes: (1) 
<I>Medical:</I> physical rehabilitation through medical, dental, opthalmological, and other 
services.  Where necessary, treatment is on a continuous basis commencing on admission to the 
institution.  (2) <I>Psychiatric:</I> social and group therapy.  (3) <I>Other activities:</I> religious 
and social gatherings, etc.<P>

The "state of the art" of South African research within the field of alcohol/drug-related 
problems is discussed in some detail, with special attention to the alcohol/drug-related research 
programme of the Human Sciences Research Council.  Attention is given to themes, funding, 
organization, and design of the relevant research.  The body of knowledge that has been 
accumulated in this respect is also outlined (for example, the broader drinking structure in this 
country, the magnitude/nature/development of alcohol-related problems, and preventive 
strategies).  This discussion is used as a basis for identifying research priorities for the future.  It 
is believed that this prioritizing is essential if researchers within the field of preventing/treating 
alcohol/drug-related problems wish to meet the challenge of the 1990s and, indeed, wish to be 
truly of service within their communities.<P>

Over the previous two decades, gender and age remained the main differentiating factors in 
drinking practices in the RSA.  Drinking was a particularly male phenomenon.  More men drink, 
and they drink more frequently and consume larger quantities of absolute alcohol per year than 
do women.  Beer drinking occurs especially among younger people, while spirit drinking is 
particularly prevalent among older people.  Percentages of alcohol consumers drinking more 
than 36.5 L of absolute alcohol per year: white males 3.5%, females 1%; colored males 9%, 
females 3%; Indian males 6%, females 3%; black males 33%, females 16%.  Overall increase in 
casual drinking not expected to lead to great increase in drinking-related problems in the RSA.  
Further research is needed on findings elsewhere that attitudes/norms/social expectations 
regarding drinking practices are frequently not only of a cultural or shared nature but also 
situation specific.<P>

Two studies of drug use among Zambian students are described: the first based on a sample 
of 336 secondary school students and the second on a sample of 1836 students from a wide 
range of educational institutions.  All these students belonged to a select group, and their 
patterns of drug use may not be typical of the majority of youth who have not been able to 
continue with their education.  Lifetime prevalence rates are examined, and it is shown that while 
up to 10% of the female students experimented with cannabis, only male students tended to 
become regular users.  Apart from minor tranquilizers, the use of other drugs was relatively 
uncommon, and there were no reports of the use of morphine, heroin, or cocaine.  A connection 
between the frequency of reporting of problems and the drugs used indicates that there is a small 
proportion of vulnerable students who could be helped if detected early.<P>

Origins of khat and its scientific study described.  Composition and action briefly reviewed.  
Availability in East Africa, Yemen.  A mild stimulant, commonly used for recreation and 
medicinal purposes by travelers, students, motor drivers.  Today, chewed; ancient times, as a 
tea.  Used generally in the context of a group.  Users mostly adult, and more men than women.  
<I>Very widely used</I>in areas where it is used, estimates range from 50% to 80%.  In 
Yemen, "khat parties" characteristic.  Physical action: constipation, gastritis.  Tannic acid may 
damage liver.  Has been used in Somalia as traditional remedy for bronchial asthma.  Some 
novices experience sleeplessness until they find optimal dose level.  Consensus that khat 
chewing produces some psychological but not physical dependence; rarely causes toxic 
psychosis or schizophrenic reactions; some foolhardy fearlessness, but no definite correlation 
with criminal or antisocial behavior.  In places where khat must be imported, represents 
substantial drain on user's pocketbook (about 25% of total income).  Prolonged use results in 
aftereffects: irritability, depression, apathy, loss of motivation.  Anti-khat legislation has been 
discussed and implemented in various places and times, but has been revoked everywhere 
except Saudi Arabia.<P>

Khat <I>(Catha edulis</I> Forsk.), known in Somalia as "qaad" or "jaad," is a plant whose 
leaves and stem tips are chewed for their stimulating effect.  From the Harar area (southeastern 
Ethiopia), khat has been introduced at different times into the present-day territories of Somalia, 
Djibouti, Yemen, Kenya, Madagascar, Tanzania, and down to southeastern Africa.  The plant, 
which belongs to the Celestraceae family, grows wild at altitudes of 1500-2000 meters above sea 
level.  Among the various compounds present in the plant (more than forty alkaloids, glycosides, 
tannins, terpenoids, etc.), two phenylalkylamines, namely cathine ((+)-norpseudoephedrine) and 
cathinone ((-)<I>S-o-</I>aminopropiophenone) seem to account mostly for the effect.  The 
consumers get a feeling of well-being, mental alertness, and excitement.  The aftereffects are 
usually insomnia, numbness, and lack of concentration.  The excessive use of khat may create 
considerable problems of social, health, and economic nature.  These problems have been 
summarily reviewed.  Khat chewing started at different times in different parts of Somalia.  Since 
WW2, the prevalence of the practice has continuously increased and no social group is 
excluded.  An epidemiological research to compare Northern and Southern regions of Somalia 
and to obtain a rough estimate of prevalence, definition of social characteristics of the groups of 
consumers, specification of the motivations, patterns of use, and effects during and after 
consumption has been conducted.  Consumers and nonconsumers (7485 people) were randomly 
interviewed in the two regions.  Khat consumption in relation to sex, age, occupation, and grade 
of educaiton is presented.<P>

The chewing of th eleaves of the plant called khat <I>(Catha edulis </I>Forsk) is a common 
habit in some countries of East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.  Khat-chewing has a 
stimulating effect on the central nervous system, which is the reason for the widespread abuse of 
this plant.  From the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, khat-chewing spread from the limited area of 
the northwestern part of Somalia to the whole country, assuming epidemic proportions.  Khat-
chewing was recognized as a real national problem with adverse consequences for the health 
and socioeconomic development of the country.  A law prohibiting the use, importation, 
cultivation, and trade of khat was enacted in 1983, and it has been strongly enforced by a 
comprehensive national programme that has mobilized the whole country to achieve its 
objectives.  Committees to coordinate action on khat control were established at the national, 
regional, and local levels.  An information and education campaign through the use of the mass 
media has been carried out to support the national programme.  After the successes achieved in 
the enforcement of the prohibition law, the national authorities, hampered by a shortage of 
financial resources, have had major difficulties in providing farmers with adequate compensation 
for damage caused to them by the destruction of khat plantations.  Difficulties were also 
experienced in coping with the unemployment of those who were involved in the khat business 
and in establishing the recreational facilities needed to provide healthy social alternatives to 
khat-chewing sessions.  These difficulties have only been partly solved.  Although small amounts 
of khat are still smuggled into the country and clandestinely consumed, the level of khat-chewing 
and its associated problems have been substantially reduced.  Nevertheless, in order to ensure 
the complete success of the prohibition law, international cooperation appears to be 
essential.<P>

Article follows Yemeni government's prohibition of khat cultivation on government lands and 
of chewing of khat on the job by government employees [later revoked after widespread 
opposition and demonstrations].  Since khat is such a low-grade stimulant, concern arises from a 
wide range of indirect health, social, and economic consequences of chronic khat use.  Khat 
competes with coffee for Yemen's limited supply of well-watered mountain terraces, and while 
khat is consumed locally, coffee provides foreign exchangeand overseas coffee sales had 
dropped from US$6 million prior to 1962 to $1 million in 1971.  Review of history and patterns of 
khat use, research, cultivation, and marketing in Yemen.<P>

Short overview of status and activities as of 1978 of WHO Programme in Drug Dependence 
(now the Programme on Substance Abuse, or PSA).  Responsibilities were (1) to collaborate with 
countries in planning, managing, and evaluating programmes concerrned with the identification 
and magnitude of the problem, prevention of drug dependence, treatment and rehabilitation of 
those affected; (2) to collaborate with countries in the training of health, social welfare, 
education, and other professionals involved in the management of drug dependence; (3) to 
stimulate, coordinate, and promote research required for more effective programmes; (4) to 
recommend to the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs whether a substance should be controlled 
nationally or internationally and the level of such control, based on the benefit and risk ratio; and 
(5) to give advice in the planning and implementation of drug dependence programmes 
sponsored by UN agencies and other intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations.  
Reviewed country, regional, or interregional programmes in Thailand, Burma [Myanmar], 
Pakistan, and Iran; a study on the long-terrm effects of cannabis use; a seminar on drug 
dependence in Central America; a working group on early intervention programmes in drug 
abuse; and national collaborating centers in Canada and Mexico.  Summarized four 
epidemiology and treatment evaluation programmes.  Summarized international drug control 
treaties.<P>

<TITLE>Annual Report for 1993/94</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>ANNUAL REPORT 1993/1994</H1>
<HR>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA) was created by an Act of Parliament in 1988 to 
provide a national focus for Canadian efforts to reduce or eliminate the harms associated with the use of 
alcohol and other drugs. Using funding from Canada's Drug Strategy and revenue generated though its 
own efforts, the CCSA promotes informed debate on substance abuse issues, encourages public 
participation in harm reduction measures, and publishes information on the nature, extent and 
consequences of drug use. The Centre conducts a limited agenda of research on alcohol and other drug 
problems, operates the National Clearinghouse on Substance Abuse, and publishes a newsletter, 
<I>Action News</I>.<P>
On March 23, 1990, the CCSA Board of Directors approved the following mission statement:<P>
<I>The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse will provide leadership and a national focus for 
Governments, community, professional and volunteer agencies, the private sector and labour 
organizations, and thus contribute to the reduction or elimination of the harm associated with the abuse 
of licit and illicit drugs.</I><P><B>
</B><H2>From the chair . . .</H2>
It is a pleasure to present to you the 1993/94 annual report of the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, 
the fifth report since the Centre was created.<P>
Following the trend away from expensive, glossy annual reports, this report is printed and distributed as 
part of CCSA's newsletter, Action News. This meets the requirement to issue an annual report while 
eliminating the cost of producing a separate document. As a organization that is responsive to public 
concern, the Centre is particularly sensitive to the need to reduce costs and conserve paper.<P>
This report captures the essential elements of a very busy and productive year at the Centre. By targeting 
it to readers of Action News, we know it will be seen by the people most interested in the Centre's 
progress.<P>
Jacques LeCavalier and his staff are to be congratulated for meeting and surpassing the objectives set out 
in our 1993/94 business plan. With you, I look forward to a year of continuing progress at the Centre in 
dealing with the serious and costly issues resulting from substance abuse.<P>

<H2>1993/94 IN REVIEW</H2>
"We are all coming under increasing pressure to demonstrate that our approaches are yielding a good 
return on investment."<BR>
--Jacques G. LeCavalier, CEO<BR>
Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse<P>
Ask any number of people at CCSA to name the most important thing we did as an organization during 
1993/94 and I suspect you'd get a variety of answers. For some people the event of the year was our co-
hosting of the Fifth International Conference on the Reduction of Drug-Related Harm, held for the first 
time in the Americas. For others, our launching of Canada's first national information service on fetal 
alcohol syndrome was the highlight. I wouldn't argue with either of these choices.<P>
My own vote for the most meaningful activity of the period, however, would go to an ambitious project 
now under way to establish international standards for measuring the economic impact of alcohol and 
other drug abuse. The Centre took the lead on this initiative a year ago at a meeting in Washington, DC of 
economists and health officials from several countries. We offered to organize an international symposium 
in May, 1994, on methods of assessing the health, social and economic costs of substance abuse. We also 
agreed to chair a working group of experts from the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the United 
Kingdom whose task will be to prepare a first draft, by September, 1994, of global guidelines for 
economic cost estimation.<P>
The job this working group has taken on, under CCSA's director of policy and research, Dr. Eric Single, 
is a difficult one--some might say, too ambitious. That may be, but it is becoming more and more evident 
that without authoritative estimates of drug-related harm, we have no way to judge the results of the 
actions we take to try to reduce that harm. More pointedly, those of us whose work is supported by money 
from the public or private sector are coming under increasing pressure to demonstrate that our approaches 
are yielding a good return on investment. This project will yield a set of guidelines, developed by world-
class authorities, that can be used in Canada to assess the cost of substance abuse and to determine how 
much of that cost is avoidable. The long-term goal is to promote studies which will measure return on 
investment in programming designed to reduce that cost.<P>
The economic costs project is a good example of the kind of challenges the Centre is uniquely equipped to 
take on. The rest of this report is devoted to other such examples.<P>
<H3>Providing credible information</H3>
The Centre operates the National Clearinghouse on Substance Abuse which, in turn, coordinates the 
Canadian Substance Abuse Information Network, a consortium of specialized libraries and resource 
centres across Canada. Network membership grew in 1993/94 to include Health Canada, the Canadian 
Clearinghouse on Disability Issues, the National AIDS Clearinghouse, and the resource centres of the 
Labrador Inuit Health Commission and Addictions and Community Funded Programs (formerly 
NNADAP). The Clearinghouse also expanded its capacity to deliver information with the creation of an 
electronic bulletin board system.<P>
Under the management of Jill Austin, the Clearinghouse embarked on a major new project this year with 
the introduction of an information service dedicated to fetal alcohol syndrome/effects (FAS/FAE). With 
financial assistance from Health Canada, the Brewers Association of Canada, and the Association of 
Canadian Distillers, the Centre can now provide a wide range of stakeholders with dial-in computer 
access to comprehensive information on conferences, research, special services, and new publications 
related to the "preventable tragedy" of FAS/FAE. Those who prefer voice contact with the FAS/FAE 
reference desk can call toll-free from anywhere in Canada on 1-800-559-4514.<P>
<H3>Finding partners</H3>
Partnerships are more than a nice idea; they're often the most effective, or, indeed, the only way to get 
something done. Of the many joint ventures involving CCSA participation in 1993/94, one that stands out 
is Canadian Profile 1994. This invaluable statistical report on alcohol, tobacco and other drugs grew out 
of a collaboration between the Centre and the Addiction Research Foundation. Rather than creating an 
entirely new document to address the growing demand for "made-in-Canada" data and information, the 
Centre worked with ARF to enhance the national scope of an existing ARF publication, making it fully 
bilingual and easier to use.<P>
Another successful publishing project resulted from a partnership between the Centre and the RCMP. In 
this case, CCSA was engaged to update, redesign, produce and distribute a popular booklet originally 
developed by the RCMP's Drug Awareness Program entitled Drugs and the Workplace.<P>
Yet another partnership that blossomed during 1993/94 involved the Studies Unit of the Health Promotion 
Directorate at Health Canada. The Centre is assisting the unit in the management of research, analysis of 
Health Canada's 1993 General Social Survey, and preparation of a research report called Horizons 1994, 
to be published in fall, 1994.<P>
<H3>Identifying key issues</H3>
The centre plays a vital role in scanning the horizon for emerging issues. It does this, in part, by chairing 
the National Working Group on Alcohol and Other Drug Policy, which has provided a forum for national 
policy discussions since the demise of the Federal-Provincial Advisory Committee on Alcohol and Other 
Drug Problems. The group, chaired by Dr. Single, includes a variety of federal, provincial and non-
governmental policy experts. During 1993/94, the group completed a discussion paper on FAS which was 
widely circulated to medical specialists, adoptive parent and other FAS groups, provincial agencies and 
representatives of the alcohol industry. A second paper on needle exchange was nearing the final-draft 
stage as the period ended. Next on the group's agenda is a paper looking at innovative approaches to harm 
reduction.<P>
The Centre sets a selective research agenda of its own focusing on issues which have not received the 
attention they deserve. The economic costs project which I described earlier is an example of the way in 
which such issues can be raised. Another important concern the Centre has helped bring to light is the 
need for more and better research in the area of Native substance abuse. The issue is explored in detail in 
a collection of papers edited by CCSA senior policy analyst Diane McKenzie. The papers emanated from a 
historic meeting of Native and non-Native researchers organized by the Centre.<P>
<H3>Bringing people together</H3>
As a co-sponsor of the Fifth International Conference on the Reduction of Drug-Related Harm, along with 
ARF and the Mersey Drug Training and Information Centre, CCSA was instrumental in putting Canadian 
delegates in touch with hundreds of harm reduction experts from 40 countries. Not surprisingly, a few of 
them reacted strongly to some of the more liberal interpretations of harm reduction advanced by several 
European, Australian and even American speakers. However, as a first step toward understanding and 
perhaps expanding the definition of harm reduction within the Canadian context, the meeting was 
invaluable. The Centre's deputy chief executive officer Pamela Fralick and senior policy analyst Dr. Diane 
Riley did a commendable job as part of the team organizing the March, 1994, meeting in Toronto.<P>
Another meeting that brought together a diversity of viewpoints was the Second National Workshop on 
AIDS, Alcohol and Other Drug Use in Edmonton in February, 1994, co-sponsored by CCSA, Health 
Canada, and the Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission (AADAC). Health professionals, street 
workers, policy makers, researchers, police and HIV-positive men and women gathered to confront a 
picture of AIDS that has changed significantly since the first national workshop was held four years ago. 
Dr. Riley was co-chair of the workshop and is currently editing the proceedings. The event received 
considerable media attention thanks to the combined efforts of AADAC communications staff and 
workshop media director Richard Garlick, CCSA's director of communications.<P>
The Centre explored less traditional ways of bringing people together through the establishment of special 
interest networks. After extensive consultation in two special interest areas--youth and workplace--senior 
liaison officer Gary Roberts developed proposals for bringing both groups into CCSA's new electronic 
bulletin board system. If the proposals are accepted and funding can be found, two new computerized 
networks will be created to serve both special interest groups. Funding possibilities are also being explored 
for a national culture/race and substance abuse network in collaboration with ARF.<P>
<H3>Promoting excellence</H3>
In 1992, the Centre established the CCSA Award of Distinction to recognize achievements by individuals 
and organizations at the national level in a broad range of categories related to substance abuse. In 1993, 
the Award program was expanded to include provincial and territorial winners. From a list of 12 prize 
recipients across Canada, one was chosen by a national selection committee to receive the top award in a 
ceremony in Ottawa. The winner was Leonard Blumenthal, chief executive officer of the Alberta Alcohol 
and Drug Abuse Commission, who received his award from Her Excellency Mrs. Gerda Hnatyshyn in 
November, 1993, at Rideau Hall. Mrs. Hnatyshyn has agreed to present the award again in 1994.<P>
<H3>Making policy recommendations</H3>
The Centre was very active in policy formulation during 1993/94, achieving consensus among numerous 
stakeholders on key recommendations in several policy areas. A policy statement issued jointly by CCSA 
and ARF in November, 1993, following an International Symposium on Moderate Drinking and Health 
stimulated a lot of media attention. The statement, based on evidence linking reduced risk of coronary 
heart disease with moderate alcohol consumption, will appear in a forthcoming issue of the Canadian 
Medical Association Journal, along with a summary of the symposium.<P>
In 1993, CCSA joined with several other concerned organizations and individuals to respond to problems 
raised by the introduction by Labatt of an extra-strength beer. An ad hoc group, including CCSA, People 
to Reduce Impaired Driving Everywhere (PRIDE), Concerns Canada, and the Traffic Injury Research 
Foundation, leveled strong criticism at the way the new beer was priced and promoted with an obvious 
appeal to the youth market. Confirming the group's worst fears, Molson introduced a similar product. In 
meetings with the breweries, the Brewers Association of Canada and two Ontario cabinet ministers the 
Centre recommended that beer--and, in fact, all alcoholic beverages--be sold at prices reflective of its 
alcohol content. CCSA argued that higher prices for extra-strength beer would cut consumption, 
especially by young drinkers, and reduced prices for low-alcohol beers would encourage moderation.<P>
In a related issue, the Centre received the endorsement of 11 key substance abuse organizations for its 
recommendation to the federal health minister that taxes not be lowered on beverage alcohol. The 
Association of Canadian Distillers had called for such a reduction after the federal government lowered 
tobacco taxes in an effort to curb smuggling. The Centre contended that alcohol taxes should not be cut 
without first determining what effect lower tobacco taxes might have on the illegal importation of both 
cigarettes and liquor, and on consumption levels.<P>
Finally, as the 1993/94 period ended, the Centre was preparing detailed comments on Bill C-7, the new 
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The bill was originally introduced by the Mulroney government as 
C-85, but was still awaiting third reading when the Conservatives were voted out of office. Reintroduced 
with some changes by the Liberals as C-7, the proposed drug legislation has been severely criticized by 
many groups for relying too heavily on the courts and law enforcement to deal with complex health and 
social problems. The Centre made specific recommendations for bringing the bill into line with the spirit 
of Canada's Drug Strategy.<P>
The preceding review of CCSA activities has been brief and selective, as befits the no-frills format of our 
1993/94 annual report. You will find more details on these and other projects in the pages of our 
newsletter, Action News. Or, get in touch with me or the appropriate CCSA staff member to ask any 
questions you may have about our goals and objectives. <P>

<H2>AUDITORS' REPORT</H2>
To the Board of Directors of Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse:<P>
We have audited the balance sheet of <B>Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse</B> as at March 31, 
1994 and the statement of revenue and expenses and surplus for the year then ended.  These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the organization's management.  Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.<P>
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards 
require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation.<P>
In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
the organization as at March 31, 1994 and the results of its operations for the year then ended in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.<P>

<H1>Call for manuscript proposals for a 
special issue of The International Journal of 
the Addictions focusing on substance use 
among rural populations</H1>
We are seeking proposals for manuscripts for inclusion in a special issue of <U>The International Journal of 
the Addictions</U> that will address issues relating to substance use among rural populations with an 
expected publication date of early 1997. We invite anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists and other 
social scientists who are studying alcohol and other drug use in rural areas around the world to submit one 
to two paragraph descriptions of proposed manuscripts for consideration by the editors. These descriptions 
should include the focus of the research, identification of the study population, type of data collected, 
significant findings of the study, as well as limitations of the study and unresolved issues which merit 
further study. Proposed articles can include those focused on epidemiological patterns, causes and 
correlates of substance use in a rural population; treatment and education efforts in rural settings; as well as 
changes in substance use patterns and consequences that are be occurring in rural areas along with political, 
economic and other societal changes. Research addressing rural-urban comparisons will be considered if the 
prima y focus of the article is the rural population. Preference will be given to studies including quantitative 
ant/or qualitative data.<P>
In keeping with the editorial spirit of the <U>IJA</U>, Drs. Ruth Edwards of Colorado State University and 
Joe Donnermeyer of The Ohio State University, guest co-editors for this special issue, encourage proposals 
for articles addressing rural substance use issues in societies all over the world.  It is recognized that rural 
areas arc rich in their social and cultural diversity and that there will be differences in the definition of 
"moral" as well as the definition of "substance abuse" depending on the cultural and geographic context. 
We welcome proposals for articles that will help readers understand this diversity.<P>
Please send proposals by mail, e-mail or fax; no later than November 1, 1995 to:<P>

<P>
<H3>1.0 Greetings, introductions</H3>
Lee Peacock, chair of the teleconference, welcomed members of the DAW/NAAW 
working group and invited guests to the call.<P>
<H3>2.0 National Award Update</H3>
Gary Roberts sent to all provincial and territorial coordinators of the Award of Excellence 
program. He suggested using the same nomination form as was developed in 1995 (sample 
attached) to reduce costs. Some of the contact names and addresses may have changed, 
but he didn't think it would be a problem. Working group members agreed.<P>
Gary has heard from Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and British Columbia 
regarding how many copies of the nomination form they need for their own promotions. 
Cathy Work, of AADAC, requested 200, and Jocelyne Gauthier, of Yukon, asked for 
100.<P>
CCSA is doing a major promotional push for the Award. Copies of the nomination form 
will be mailed to approximately 3,000 Action News readers in April. The deadline for 
nominations to provincial and territorial committees is June 15.<P>
CCSA met with representatives from Mrs. Diane Fowler-Leblanc's office, regarding Her 
Excellency's participation in the Award ceremonies. Mrs. Leblanc is interested in 
presenting the Award and Rideau Hall would provide a venue.<P>
<H3>3.0 Canada's Top 100</H3>
Louise Mayo was unable to attend the teleconference, and Cathy Work updated the 
working group on this project.<P>
The Nechi Institute is very interested in revising the booklet, which was first published by 
CCSA in June 1991. Canada's Top 100 briefly describes DAW/NAAW activities 
organized across the country by community groups, individuals and organizations to 
promote drug awareness (a copy is attached).<P>
Working group members interested in the project are Kathy Hancock, Lee Peacock and 
Brian Wilbur. Brian will ask a regional coordinator to gather the information and send it to 
Cathy or Louise.<P>
After Easter, Louise will send group members a letter outlining the project and explaining 
what she needs from them. Louise will design a form for working group members to use. 
This will ensure the information is consistent (i.e., contact names, addresses, telephone 
and fax numbers).<P>
Marie Boivin, of the Elks/Royal Purple, is interested in having the provincial drug 
awareness chairs participate, and Cathy Work suggested she contact Louise directly to 
make arrangements on how the Elks could submit information. Cathy, Louise and Tess 
Radford will make arrangements to gather the information from coordinators not present 
at the teleconference.<P>
<H3>4.0 Canadian AIDS Society and AIDS Awareness 
Week</H3>
Tess Radford met recently with Liz Goodman of the Canadian AIDS Society (CAS). Each 
year, CAS selects an annual theme for their awareness campaign, which is launched at the 
beginning of AIDS Awareness Week, held at the end of September. For 1996/97, the 
theme is HIV, AIDS and substance use.<P>
Working group members were asked to consider using the same theme as a part of their 
campaigns to draw attention to the link between substance use and AIDS. A benefit is that 
promotional materials have already been developed.<P>
Jocelyne Gauthier said the Yukon has already selected youth as its target group for 
NAAW 1996, but could work in HIV, AIDS and substance use as the issue is very 
relevant. AADAC is also focusing on youth, but may also consider AIDS.<P>
Tess will append information from CAS to the minutes.<P>
<H3>5.0 Updates</H3>
<H4>5.1 Newfoundland</H4>
Carol Ann MacDonald is new chair of the DAW organizing committee. The committee 
has met twice, and several ideas have been tossed around regarding the theme and focus 
for 1996. Nothing has been decided, but youth will be a main focus.<P>
<H4>5.2 Nova Scotia</H4>
Brian Wilbur said the province will use the theme "Keep your dreams alive", and the flying 
star symbol again for 1996. The committee has not yet decided on the content of the 
campaign.<P>
<H4>5.3 Alberta</H4>
Cathy Work said the provincial organizing committee has met once, and members have 
gone through the 1995 activities and evaluation report. A copy will be mailed to working 
group members.<P>
For NAAW 1996, AADAC, its member agencies and funded institutions will target youth 
9 to 13 years of age, and will rework the theme "Going somewhere, it's your choice" so 
that it will have a greater impact with this group. The budget for 1996 is limited ($5,000), 
and the focus will be on resource development, not activities. That will be left to 
AADAC's field offices and the agencies.<P>
<H4>5.4 Nechi Institute</H4>
Cathy Work, reporting for Louise Mayo, said Nechi has received federal funding for its 
on-reserve campaign, but has heard nothing regarding funding for its campaigns for non-
Aboriginals and urban communities. The evaluation report from the 1995 campaign will be 
sent to working group members in another month.<P>
<H4>5.5 Yukon</H4>
Jocelyne Gauthier said the evaluation of NAAW 1995 in the territory is completed, but 
she has no time to do a report. The organizing committee is struggling, and a few 
meetings were held where no one showed up. At the last one, held two weeks ago, the 
committee decided on youth as its theme.<P>
<H4>5.6 British Columbia</H4>
Lee Peacock said DAW is at crossroads: the province completed its three-year strategy 
and the evaluation report found the number of events planned for DAW has decreased 
while the number of corporate sponsorships has increased.<P>
The provincial prevention committee is considering responsible drinking as a theme for 
1996, with the campaign being launched during DAW. Whichever theme is selected for 
the week, much of the planning depends on funding.<P>
<H4>5.7 Elks/Royal Purple</H4>
Marie Boivin met with the chairs of the Elks/Royal Purple drug awareness committees, 
and they decided the themes for the 1996/97 literary and poster contest. The national 
results from the 1995/96 contest have been decided, and the Elks are considering 
"publishing" them on E-lan, the youth electronic network sponsored by CCSA and the 
Elks.<P>
<H4>5.8 Canadian Council on Smoking and Health</H4>
Shannon Townsend is the national coordinator for the Council, and is responsible for 
National Non-Smoking Week (NNSW) and World No-Tobacco Day, scheduled for May 
31, 1996. In 1997 NNSW will be Jan. 17-22, with the theme "youth, tobacco and the 
environment".<P>
CCHS develops a national theme, poster and resource kit with suggested activities for 
NNSW. CCHS's provincial councils coordinate activities within their own jurisdiction.<P>
Shannon is interested in knowing more about DAW/NAAW, its related activities and how 
CCHS could tie in with the week, and vice-versa. In Alberta, Cathy Work said it is up to 
individual AADAC offices or agencies to make contact with other groups themselves. She 
asked for a list of the provincial contacts to be appended to the minutes. Shannon will also 
send Tess Radford information prepared by the National Clearinghouse on Smoking and 
Health.<P>
<H4>6.0 Next teleconference, chair</H4>
Scheduling the next teleconference could be difficult, as CCSA does not yet know its 
budget for 1996/97. From its discussions with Health Canada, the Centre could be facing a 
budget cut of up 65 per cent, and staff cuts or changes, and project cuts are inevitable.<P>
Tess Radford suggested setting a time and date for the teleconference, as well as selecting 
a chair. When more news is available regarding CCSA, she will pass it on to the 
group.<P>
When asked for feedback regarding the usefulness of the quarterly teleconferences, there 
was strong support. Lee Peacock said she found the teleconferences very useful, especially 
as the information exchange gives the week an increased national perspective. Jocelyn 
Gauthier said the calls were extremely useful as she does not have very much contact with 
other provinces without the conference calls. She also said it is very easy to forget about 
DAW/NAAW when she is so busy with other plans and programs; the calls keep her on 
track. Cathy Work and Brian Wilbur added their support for the calls.<P>
Cathy Work volunteered to chair the next teleconference, scheduled for June 12, at 11:00 
am EST.<P>
<H4>7.0 Adjournment</H4>
Lee Peacock adjourned the call at 11:45 am DST (Ont.)<P>

<H1>Foundation praises humane and 
pragmatic thrust of B.C. Chief Coroner's 
report on drug-related deaths</H1>
<B>(Ottawa -- February 9, 1995)</B>  The Canadian Foundation for Drug Policy today expressed 
strong support for several key recommendations of the Report of the Task Force into Illicit Narcotic 
Overdose Deaths in British Columbia.  The report, released late last month by British Columbia's Chief 
Coroner, Vince Cain, argues that currently illegal drugs should be treated as a health and social problem 
rather than as one to be dealt with primarily through the criminal justice system.   <P>
The Foundation called the report "an honest and responsible approach to an issue that is often clouded by 
political rhetoric and driven by misunderstanding.  Within a public health framework the report proposes 
many humane alternatives to the present punitive system of drug control.  These alternatives can 
significantly reduce many of the harms associated with drugs in Canadian society."  <P>
The report is particularly timely, the Foundation noted, since Parliament is now considering controversial 
amendments to Canada's drug laws.  The amendments were introduced in February 1994 as Bill C-7, the 
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.  The Bill perpetuates Canada's heavy emphasis on criminal 
punishment to deal with drugs and stands sharply at odds with many of Mr. Cain's recommendations.  
<P>
The Foundation agrees with Mr. Cain that turning Canadians who use drugs into criminals and 
incarcerating them is not the answer.  The criminal law has not been shown to deter drug use.  Foundation 
members note further that the criminal law and associated drug policies, rather than drugs themselves, 
have caused many of the harms traditionally associated with drugs.  Accordingly, it strongly supports Mr. 
Cain's call for an inquiry into non-criminal alternatives for the possession and use of specified substances.   
<P>
In May 1994, appearing before a Parliamentary subcommittee examining Bill C-7, Foundation 
representatives made a similar recommendation, calling for an independent review of Canada's drug laws 
and policies.  The Foundation also stresses that there is already abundant evidence and research available 
about the damaging effects of current drug control laws and policies. <P>
Foundation members, however, express their concern about one suggestion contained in the B.C. 
Coroner's report -- a consideration of mandatory life sentences, without parole, for importing and 
trafficking large quantities of narcotics.  They argue that heavy criminal penalties elsewhere have failed to 
deter trafficking and importing. Mandatory minimum penalties in Canada will prove equally unproductive 
and continue to waste valuable police and government resources, as the U.S. experience has shown.  <P>
The Canadian Foundation for Drug Policy is a non-profit organization founded in 1993 by several of 
Canada's leading specialists in drug policy.  Its founding members include psychologists, pharmacologists, 
lawyers, health policy advocates and public policy researchers.   <P>
The aims of the Foundation include acting as a forum for the exchange of views among those interested in 
reform of drug policies; serving as a vehicle for sharing those views and for discussing significant drug 
policy issues with government, the public, other organizations and the media; and, where necessary, 
recommending alternatives that will make Canada's drug laws and policies effective and humane.  The 
Foundation does not encourage harmful drug use. <P>

<H3><A NAME = industrie></A>L'industrie adopte des 
mesures de sécurité du public et des employés </H3>
La sécurité a toujours été une préoccupation de l'industrie du transport routier. L'industrie 
entreprend maintenant la prochaine étape qui consiste à élaborer et mettre en oeuvre des 
politiques qui permettent aux transporteurs de satisfaire à leur obligation de sécurité envers le 
public et leurs employés. <P>
À la fin des années 1980, partiellement en raison des nombreux accidents causés par la 
conduite en état d'ébriété, le Canada et les États-Unis annonçaient leur intention d'adopter des 
lois sur les tests de dépistage des drogues et de l'alcool dans l'industrie du transport routier. 
L'industrie canadienne du camionnage se prononça en faveur de cette démarche et souscrivit 
une politique de tolérane zéro à l'égard de la consommation abusive de drogues et d'alcool par 
les conducteurs. «L'industrie veut bien faire les choses, affirme Gilles Bélanger, président de 
l'ACC. À notre avis, un seul accident causé par la consommation abusive de drogues ou 
d'alcool est un accident de trop. Ce n'est pas un question de punir les gens pour avoir 
consommé des drogues ou de l'alcool. Nous nous préoccupons de la sécurité et considérons la 
question comme une mesure préventive». <P>
Les États-Unis ont été capables d'adopter rapidement une loi sur les tests de dépistage des 
drogues et de l'alcool. En vertu de la Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act de 1991 
(et de modifications ultérieures), les employeurs sont tenus de faire subir à certains conducteurs 
(y compris les camionneurs) un test de dépistage d'alcool et de cinq drogues contrôlées 
énumérées dans les règlements du Federal Highway Administration des États-Unis à ce 
chapitre. <P>
Les règles adoptées en vertu de la loi modifiée de 1991 s'appliquent depuis le ler janvier 1995 
aux entreprises américaines comptant 50 conducteurs ou plus. Couvrant plus de 6,5 millions de 
conducteurs américains, la loi, qui comprennent des dispositions sur les tests, stipule que 50 
p.100 des conducteurs choisis au hasard doivent subir un test de dépistage des drogues et 25 
p.100 un alcootest. <P>
Une exemption temporaire a été accordée aux conducteurs étrangers sur le territoire américain 
avec l'entente que le Canada adoptera une loi réciproque «dans un avenir rapproché".<P>
<H4>Transports Canada réagit</H4>
Transports Canada ne perdit pas de temps à donner suite à cette promesse et avec l'appui et 
l'aide des organisations touchées comme l'ACC, le Ministère se mit à élaborer une loi touchant 
les drogues et l'alcool. <P>
Pour déterminer la mise en oeuvre et le contenu souhaitables de la politique, Transports Canada 
et l'association du camionnage de la Colombie-Britannique mirent sur pied un projet pilote qui 
permettait d'obtenir aussi l'apport des intervenants touchés.<P>
Le projet comprenait deux grands éléments: examen de la disposition à révéler les habitudes de 
consommation de drogues et d'alcool et consentement au test de dépistage. Selon Bélanger, 
l'expérience fut profitable. «Le gouvernement a pu observer les éléments positifs et négatifs et le 
projet a permis de sensibiliser l'industrie aux enjeux». <P>
Peu de compagnies entreprirent de mettre au point leur propre politiques en matière de drogues 
et d'alcool croyant que la législation fédérale était imminente. «La plupart des compagnies 
attendent pour s'assurer que leur politique est conforme à la réglementation gouvernementale», 
explique la directrice exécutive de l'ACC, Laura Kilgour. Cependant, quelques compagnies, 
surtout celles pour qui les voyages Nord-Sud sont très profitables, ont établi et mis en oeuvre 
leurs propres programmes.<P>
Imperial Oil a un des programmes de prévention d'alcoolisme et de toxicomanie les plus 
importants en milieu de travail. Mis sur pied il y a trois ans, il couvre déjà environ 600 employés 
dans des postes critiques pour la sécurité et a récemment été étendu au-delà des limites de 
ltentreprise comme telle. En effet, Imperial Oil exigera bientôt que les transporteurs «externes» 
travaillant en son nom mettent en place un programme similaire à l'intérieur de leur propre 
entreprise. <P>
<H4>L'industrie se met de la partie  </H4>
Après près de cinq années passées à élaborer le cadre législatif d'une politique canadienne 
touchant les drogues et l'alcool pour industrie du camionnage, le gouvernement fédéral s'est 
retiré du processus à la fin de l'année dernière. La décision du gouvernement a pris l'industrie du 
camionnage au dépourvu et a pratiquement forcée à réaliser par elle-même les politiques et 
programmes pertinents. <P>
Compléter la tâche est maintenant devenu une question de grande urgence puisqu'en 1996, les 
règles américaines s'appliqueront à tous les conducteurs professionels étrangers qui traversent la 
frontière américaine. Le problème est d'autant plus compliqué qu'au moment d'aller sous presse, 
les États-Unis n'ont pas encore publié les règles définitives destinées aux conducteurs étrangers. 
<P>
II n'est donc pas étonnant que plusieurs transporteurs soient impatients de formuler et de mettre 
en place des programmes de dépistage des drogues et de l'alcool en milieu de travail conformes 
aux règles américaines. Bien que la préoccupation soit légitime, explique Kilgour, les 
compagnies doivent mettre beaucoup de soin dans l'élaboration de leur programme de 
dépistage car ils pourraient ne pas répondre aux exigences rigoureuses de la Loi canadienne sur 
les droits de la personne. <P>
<H4>Droits de la personne en cause  </H4>
Comme l'explique Kilgour, l'environnement législatif au Canada diffère considérablement de 
celui de son voisin du Sud dont le programme est prévu dans la loi. La loi canadienne sur les 
droits de la personne considère l'alcoolisme ou la toxicomanie actuel ou passé comme une 
«déficience". Par conséquent, les employeurs qui limitent ou réduisent les possibilités ¾ 
congédiement ou refus de recruter par exemple ¾ en fonction de l'alcoolisme ou de la 
toxicomanie peuvent être accusés de discrimination. Ils doivent donc éviter de faire preuve de 
discrimination en vertu de la loi. «Nous ne pouvons tout simplement pas prendre les règles 
américaines et les appliquer au Canada, souligne Kilgour. Nos politiques et programmes doivent 
être élaborées au Canada, par les Canadiens pour cadrer avec le contexte canadien". <P>
Lorsque le ministre des Transports a annoncé sa décision de ne pas aller de l'avant avec la 
législation, les associations de camionnage ont immédiatement réagi en formant une coalition 
pour examiner les enjeux pour les conducteurs étrangers des règles proposées par le 
Department of Transport des État-Unis touchant les tests de dépistage de drogues et d'alcool et 
pour déterminer quels obstacles le système législatif canadien pouvait poser à l'observation. Les 
associations canadienne, provinciales et régionales du camionnage ont étudié tous les éléments 
de programme essentiels à l'élaboration de politiques canadiennes globales qui tiennent compte 
des préoccupations de santé et sécurité et du respect de la vie privée. <P>
Les associations sont épaulées dans cette démarche par Barbara Butler, consultante spécialisée 
dans la conception de politiques, de programmes et de stratégies de communication touchant 
l'alcoolisme et la toxicomanie en milieu de travail. Mme Butler est l'auteur de <I>Alcohol and 
Drugs in the Workplace. </I><P><I>
</I>La priorité selon l'industrie consiste à assurer la santé et la sécurité de ses employés et du 
public. «Répondre aux exigences législatives immédiates ne sont qu'une partie d'une question 
plus vaste et plus importante: assurer la santé et la sécurité", souligne Kilgour. Tout programme 
doit assurer un bon équilibre entre prévenir les problèmes, fournir de l'aide au besoin et 
dissuader les conducteurs et autres employés de consommer des drogues illégales ou de faire 
une consommation abusive de l'alcool et des médicaments. <P>
Plusieurs études font état des conséquences de l'alcoolisme et de la toxicomanie en milieu de 
travail. La liste comprend un taux de roulement, d'accident et d'absentéisme accru de même que 
des coûts croissants d'indemnisation, de congés de maladie et d'assurance. II suffit de penser en 
plus à la perte de productivité et de potentiel humain et aux risques de vol et de trafic pour 
immédiatement être convaincus du bien-fondé de la mise en place de politiques de prévention 
de l'alcoolisme et de la toxicomanie en milieu de travail. <P>
Les programmes doivent refléter la culture unique de l'tentreprise et les valeurs de la compagnie, 
la réglementation applicable et, surtout, ses besoins particuliers de programme, met en garde 
Mme Butler. <P>
La compagnie doit commencer par établir un énoncé de position écrit et officiel touchant l'alcool 
et les drogues. La politique doit: <P>
<UL>
<LI>définir la portée et l'application du programme; 
<LI>clarifier les responsabilités de l'employeur et des employés; 
<LI>indiquer des méthodes pour déceler les problèmes; 
<LI>préciser les conséquences de la violation de la politique;
<LI>tenir compte des questions de sécurité; 
<LI>souligner les procédures de mise en oeuvre. 
</UL>
Dès qu'elle répond à ces exigences de base en matière de politique d'emploi, la compagnie peut 
établir son programme de prévention d'alcoolisme et de toxicomanie. <P>
L'ACC et les associations provinciales s'emploient, en ce moment, à mettre au point une trousse 
qui couvrira l'élaboration de programmes et de politiques de même que l'éducation des 
employés et la formation des superviseurs. La création d'un groupe est aussi en cours pour 
fournir les services connexes qu'un programme de test de dépistage peut exiger, y compris les 
prélèvements, les tests de laboratoire ou épreuves respiratoires, l'examen médical et le 
programme d'aide aux employés. <P>
Dans l'esprit de plusieurs transporteurs toutefois, une question demeure: L'industrie canadienne 
du camionnage pourra-t-elle respecter l'échéance de 1996 proposée par la FHWA? <P>
«Nous aurons un programme en place à temps pour aider les transporteurs canadiens à 
respecter l'échéance du FHWA», assure Kilgour. En attendant, toutefois, l'ACC rappelle aux 
transporteurs que répondre aux exigences des États-Unis ne constitue qu'un but crucial à court 
terme du processus à long terme consistant à garantir la securite.<P>

<H2><A NAME = politiques></A>Politiques 
touchant l'abus d'intoxicants au travail</H2>
<I>Comme on l'a rapporte le trimestre dernier  </I><P><I>
</I><I>Comme le gouvemement n'a pas adopté de législation pertinente, l'industrie du 
transport routier s'efforce d'élaborer un programme de prévention de l'abus d'intoxicants 
au travail qui allie des colloques et une gamme de services de formation et de tests de 
dépistage. Le programme decoule d'une préoccupation presente dans toute l'industrie au 
sujet de la santé et de la sécurité des employés et du public. </I><P><I>
</I><I>Les décisions concernant le programme sont d'autant compliquées que les 
chauffeurs étrangers en territoire americain pourraient, dès le début de 1996, etre 
assujettis aux nombreux et complexes règlements visant les tests de dépistage qui sont en 
vigueur aux États-Unis. Au moment d'aller sous presse, la version finale des règlements 
americains visant les chauffeurs étrangers n'avait pas encore paru.</I><P><I>
</I>En juin, l'ACC et les associations provinciales ont franchi la toute importante première 
étape lorsqu'elles ont lancé une série de colloques sur l'élaboration d'une politique de mise 
ensuivre d'un programme de prévention de l'abus d'intoxicants, colloques préparés par Barbara 
Butler, experte-conseil en la matière. <P>
"La mise en oeuvre d'un programme de prévention de l'alcoolisme et de la toxicomanie dans 
l'industrie du transport routier est impossible sans l'élaboration de politiques sous-jacentes, selon 
Laura Kilgour, directrice exécutive de l'ACC. Mme Kilgour précise bien qu'il n existe pas de 
modèle, de panacée, qui soit valable à l'échelle de l'industrie: "il incombe à chaque entreprise 
d'élaborer un programme selon ses besoins particuliers", explique-t-elle. En revanche, toutes les 
politiques doivent satisfaire certaines exigences de base - elles doivent: <P>
<UL>
<LI>être écrites et communiquées; 
<LI>donner une orientation claire; 
<LI>renvoyer à des règlements qui peuvent être appliqués; 
<LI>faire état de possibilités d'assistance; 
<LI>stipuler les conséquences du non-respect de la politique. 
</UL>
Mme Kilgour fait aussi valoir qu'il faut tenir compte des conséquences du contexte législatif 
canadien sur la prise de décisions touchant les politiques de prévention de l'abus d'intoxicants, 
en l'occurrence: <P>
<UL>
<LI>la responsabilité directe - quant aux gestes posés par des employés qui sont intoxiqués au 
travail (les organismes sont responsables des actes négligents ou répréhensibles commiss par un 
employé pendant la période d'emploi) et aussi en ce qui a trait à la consommation d'alcool aux 
fonctions officielles; 
<LI>la santé et la sécurité au travail - l'obligation de faire preuve de diligence raisonnable au 
regard de la sécurité au travail (il incombe aux employeurs de protéger la santé, la sécurité et le 
bien-être de leurs employés et d'exercer une diligence raisonnable en minimisant les dangers); 
<LI>les lois sur les droits de la personne - il faut accommoder les employés qui ont des 
déficiences, y compris une dépendance actuelle ou passée sur l'alcool ou les stupéfiants (il faut 
faire la part entre les questions de responsabilité et de sécurité associées à la consommation 
d'intoxicants au travail et les dispositions législatives destinées à protéger les alcooliques et les 
toxicomanes qui peuvent être considérés comme ayant une déficience). 
</UL>
Une politique claire et bien communiquée, appliquée avec logique et uniformité, est le meilleur 
moyen de faire face à ces questions... et c'est justement ce qui a poussé l'industrie à créer des 
colloques. En effet, ces colloques qu'offrent les associations provinciales aideront les 
transporteurs à formuler des politiques internes qui feront la part entre la diligence raisonnable et 
le respect de l'intimité de chacun. <P>
Toutefois, l'ACC avertit les transporteurs que l'élaboration d'un programme de prévention de 
l'alcoolisme et de la toxicomanie au travail est un exercice délicat qui donne lieu à beaucoup de 
confusion et d'information fautive. <P>
"L'administration de tests de dépistage dans le milieu de travail est un domaine prometteur pour 
les fournisseurs de services, ajoute Mme Kilgour, mais ceux-ci ne sont pas tous au courant des 
exigences particulières du contexte juridique canadien.  Je conseille donc aux transporteurs de 
se méfier des solutions miracles et de bien examiner la situation avant de s'engager La réussite 
d'un programme de prévention dans le secteur du transport routier dépend des conseils experts 
obtenus de fournisseurs de services compétents.<P>
"Nous exhortons les transporteurs à profiter des colloques qu'offrent les associations de 
transport routier provinciales et régionales. Nous avons obtenu les meilleurs conseils possible et 
les colloques ont été créés par une experte en matière de programmes de prévention de l'abus 
d'intoxicants au travail (au Canada)." <P>
Les colloques étalés sur trois demi-journées s'adressent aux directeurs généraux, aux présidents 
et aux cadres supérieurs des entreprises. lls portent sur des questions clés comme: <P>
<UL>
<LI>la définition d'objectifs, l'application de la politique et le respect des normes imposées; 
<LI>la compéhension des règles et responsabilités en jeu; 
<LI>l'aspect prévention, sous forme de modules sur d'éducation et de formation; 
<LI>la prise de décisions difficiles sur des questions délicates comme les postes critiques pour 
la sécurité, les tests de dépistage d'alcool et de drogues, la consommation d'alcool aux fonctions 
officielles, les fouilles, les interventions auprès des entrepreneurs et les conséquences des 
dérogations à la politique; 
<LI>les moyens de mise en oeuvre et de communication. 
</UL>
L'ACC et les associations provinciales s'emploient également à constituer un groupe de 
fournisseurs de services hautement qualifiés et expérimentés susceptibles de collaborer avec 
l'industrie pour fournir des services dans les secteurs clés suivants: <P>
<UL>
<LI>les programmes d'aide aux employés;
<LI>les programmes de sensibilisation des employés (formation, documents sur papier et 
vidéo); 
<LI>la formation des superviseurs (obligatoire selon les règlements en vigueur aux États-Unis);
<LI>les tests de dépistage d'alcool et de drogues, y compris les prélèvements; 
<LI>les examens médicaux. 
</UL>
Ce groupe, qui bénéficiera des avantages associés aux achats en nombre, fournira aux 
transporteurs une gamme complète de services à un prix raisonnable, éliminant ainsi le fardeau 
de devoir recruter directement des fournisseurs de services de dépistage et d'autres fonctions 
connexes.<P>

<H2><A NAME = 
consommation></A>Consommation de stupefiants 
et d' alcool:  le compte a rebours</H2>
Dans les numeros du printemps et de l'éte' du Magazine ACC, il etait question de l'élaboration 
de politiqués en milieu de travail et du programme, mis sur pied par vos associations du 
camionnage, pour traiter les questions de consommation de stupefiants et d' alcool visant, plus 
precisement, l'aptitude aux fonctions ainsi que la santé et sécurité du public et des employés des 
transporteurs dans le contexte juridique canadien. Cette initiative nationale a guichet unique 
fournira aux transporteurs l'accès au meilleurs fournisseurs de services au Canada et leur 
permettra de repondre à toutes les exigences du programme canadien tout en assurant la 
conformité aux exigences américaines récemment annoncées.<P>
La décision longtemps attendue de la Federal Highway Administration des Etats-Unis (FHWA) 
quant au dépistage de drogues et de stupéfiants chez les chauffeurs des transporteurs routiers 
étrangers faisant affaires aux États-Unis ne contient pas de surprise. Comme on s'y attendait, les 
règles s'appliquant aux employés américains ont été étendues à tous les chauffeurs et 
employeurs étrangers. Les règles sont complexes et nous vous en présentons ici un aperçu. 
Chaque transporteur touché aura intérêt à se procurer un exemplaire complet des règles en 
s'adressant à n'importe quelle association provinciale du camionnage.<P>
Les règlements américains ne sont qu'un élément parmi plusieurs dont les transporteurs 
canadiens doivent tenir compte pour élaborer leur programme concernant l'usage de stupéfiants 
et d'alcool en milieu de travail. Avant de concevoir leur programme ou de s'adresser à tout 
fournisseur de service, il est fortement conseillé aux transporteurs d'obtenir de l'aide 
professionnelle à cet égard, comme celle offerte dans le cadre des séminaires offerts par les 
associations provinciales du camionnage sur l'élaboration de politiques.<P>
<H4>À partir de quelle date les transporteurs devront-ils se 
conformer aux règlements?</H4>
Dans un esprit de «consistance et d'équité» à l'endroit des employeurs étrangers, la FHWA a 
prévu un système d'entrée en vigueur progressive à deux volets semblable à l'instauration 
graduelle prévue pour les employeurs américains.<P>
Les dates d'entrée en vigueur de la réglementation américaine sont les suivantes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Le 1er juillet 1996 pour les employeurs étrangers d'envergure: c'est-à-dire les<B> 
</B>employeurs comptant 50 chauffeurs ou plus assignés à la conduite de véhicules<B> 
</B>commerciaux en Amérique du Nord au 17 décembre 1995;
<LI>Le 1er juillet 1997 pour les petits employeurs étrangers: c'est-à-dire les <B>employeurs 
</B>comptant moins de 50 chauffeurs assignés à la conduite de véhicules commerciaux en 
Amérique du Nord au 17 décembre 1995.
</UL>
La conformité dépend du nombre de conducteurs assignés au sein d'une entreprise (y compris 
les employés, les voituriers-remorqueurs ou les sous contractants) peu importe le nombre 
d'entre eux qui voyagent aux États-Unis. Par exemple, explique la directrice des services aux 
membres de l'ACC, Laura Kilgour, «si une compagnie canadienne de camionnage assigne 55 
chauffeurs dont 5 seulement ont des chances de traverser éventuellement la frontière vers les 
États-Unis, la compagnie doit satisfaire aux exigences américaines en matière de dépistage 
d'alcool et de stupéfiants pour ces cinq chauffeurs». Dans ce contexte, on entend par chauffeur, 
chaque personne qui conduit un véhicule commercial ayant un poids nominal brut (PNBV) de 
26 001 livres ou plus; un autobus destiné au transport de 16 passagers ou plus (y compris le 
conducteur) ou un véhicule de n'importe quelle taille affichant des placards pour le transport de 
marchandises dangereuses.<P>
<H4>Responsabilités du chauffeur </H4>
<B>Alcool:</B> Les règlements interdisent la possession ou la consommation en cours 
d'exercice des fonctions, la consommation dans les quatre heures précédant l'exercice des 
fonctions, la consommation dans les huit heures suivant certains accidents et un taux 
d'alcoolémie de 0,02 ou plus pendant l'exercice des fonctions. <P>
<B>Stupéfiants:</B> Les règlements obligent le dépistage de la marijuana, la cocaïne, les 
opiacés, l'amphétamine et la phencyclidine (PCP). Cependant l'usage de toute substance 
controlée est interdit sauf suivant les directives d'un médecin qui confirme que la substance 
concernée n'affectera pas de façon adverse le maniement du véhicule.<P>
<H4>Responsabilités de la compagnie </H4>
L'employeur est tenu:<P>
<UL>
<LI>d'avoir une politique en milieu de travail et de la communiquer à ses employés;
<LI>de former les superviseurs et de prévoir l'accès à de l'aide pour les employés;
<LI>d'obtenir, à l'embauche de tout chauffeur et avec son consentement, de la part des 
employeurs antérieurs, les renseignements relatifs à tout test de dépistage auquel a été soumis le 
chauffeur (au cours des deux dernières années);
<LI>d'obliger le chauffeur à se soumettre à des tests de dépistage précis;
<LI>de retirer de ses fonctions tout chauffeur qui a enfreint les règlements; et
<LI>de préparer et tenir des dossiers précis.
</UL>
<H4>Tests obligatoires </H4>
Le dépistage des stupéfiants se fait par analyse d'un échantillon d'urine effectuée par un 
laboratoire certifié, les tests positifs devant être confirmés par un médecin qualifié pour faire la 
révision. Le dépistage d'alcool doit faire appel à un éthylomètre de constat approuvé et être 
effectué par un technicien formé (d'autres tests homologués peuvent être utilisés pour dépistage 
initial seulement) dans le cadre d'une «période d'exercice des fonctions». Le dépistage est 
obligatoire dans un certain nombre de circonstances:<P>
<UL>
<LI>avant l'embauche (vise les stupéfiants seulement); lorsqu'on a des soupçons raisonnables 
qu'un règlement a été enfreint basés sur les observations précises et documentées du 
superviseur formé;
<LI>à l'intérieur d'une période désignée après des accidents spécifiques; dans le cadre de 
dépistages arbitraires (non annoncés) dans une proportion minimale annuelle de 25 % des 
conducteurs en ce qui a trait à l'alcool et de 50 % en ce qui a trait aux stupéfiants;
<LI>au retour au travail après avoir fait l'objet d'un retrait pour activité interdite; et
<LI>au hasard, à titre de mesures de suivi pendant au moins un an, après la réintégration des 
fonctions suite à la constatation par un spécialiste en toxicomanie (ou SAP, substance abuse 
professional) du besoin de résoudre un problème de consommation<I> abusive </I>d'alcool 
ou de stupéfiants.
</UL>
<H4>Conséquences d'un test trouvé positif </H4>
Les règlements établissent clairement les sanctions prévues pour tout chauffeur trouvé coupable 
de violation de la réglementation en matière d'alcool et de stupéfiants. Le refus de se soumettre 
au test de dépistage est considéré comme un test trouvé positif. Le test positif exige le retrait 
immédiat des fonctions:<P>
<UL>
<LI>pendant au moins 24 heures lorsque l'alcoolémie se situe entre 0,02 et 0,039;
<LI>et une évaluation par un spécialiste en toxicomanie lorsque l'alcoolémie est de 0,04 ou plus 
ou lorsque le dépistage des stupéfiants est trouvé positif (retour au travail assorti d'un 
programme de réadaptation
<LI>obligatoire prescrit par le spécialiste en toxicomanie et d'un test trouvé négatif au retour au 
travail).
</UL>
<H4>Consortium de transporteurs routiers canadiens </H4>
L'industrie canadienne du camionnage n'est pas étonnée de voir la réglementation américaine 
étendue aux entreprises étrangères faisant affaires aux États-Unis. «Nous étions convaincus que 
l'exemption n'était que temporaire et nous avons commencé à nous préparer à nous y 
conformer, de dire Laura Kilgour. Aussi, les associations de l'industrie adaptent leurs politiques 
et programmes au contexte juridique canadien et, surtout, tiennent compte des préoccupations 
en matière de santé et sécurité.» Au cours de la dernière année, les associations provinciales du 
camionnage, en collaboration avec l'ACC et avec l'aide d'une consultante spécialisée dans la 
consommation abusive d'alcool et de drogues en milieu de travail, aident les transporteurs à 
élaborer leurs politiques et à mettre en place leurs programmes. Selon Mme Kilgour, la création 
du consortium de transporteurs routiers canadiens et la mise sur pied de programmes sont le 
fruit du leadership et des efforts dévoués du personnel de l'association du camionnage de 
l'Ontario (OTA). <P>
Depuis l'été dernier, les associations provinciales offrent une série de séminaires dans l'ensemble 
du pays intitulé «Stupéfiants et alcool: Élaboration d'une politique d'entreprise appropriée» 
animés par Barbara Butler, une experte de renom en la matière. Plusieurs centaines de 
transporteurs ont assisté aux séminaires qui continueront d'être offerts par les associations 
provinciales selon la demande. «Avec les dates d'entrée en vigueur imminentes, explique Barrie 
Montague, responsable des Opérations à l'OTA, le consortium d'associations du camionnage a 
mis au point d'autres produits et services pour offrir un guichet unique aux transporteurs routiers 
qutil stagisse d'entreprises pour compte d'autrui, d'entreprises privées ou d'autocaristes." Les 
services offerts par le consortium peuvent être achetés en partie ou en totalité et incluent:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>le dépistage d'alcool et de stupéfiants</B>, y compris des endroits partout au 
Canada pour le prélèvement d'échantillons et l'analyse de laboratoire;
<B><LI>un programme de dépistage au hasard</B> offert en collaboration avec un tiers 
faisant une sélection au moyen d'un logiciel sophistiqué impartial;
<LI>la coordination professionnelle en matière de toxicomanie et les services de médecin 
qualifié pour faire la révision incluant une liste de specialistes en toxicomanie partout au pays 
offerts aux membres du consortium;
<B><LI>les programmes d'aide aux employés (PAE), </B>maille importante de la 
prévention des problèmes de toxicomanie et de l'aide en la matière, et qui sont facultatifs et 
offerts à prix concurrentiel à tous les membres du consortium petits ou gros en raison du volume 
important prévu:
<B><LI>la formation de superviseurs</B> relativement aux exigences pratiques et 
législatives; les programmes de sensibilisation des employés et le matériel de formation avec 
accès à un menu d'outils approuvés du consortium sous forme à la fois écrite et vidéo offerts à 
des prix compétitifs aux membres du consortium en raison du volume élevé;
<B><LI>la tenue et l'administration</B> de dossiers par l'intermédiaire du tiers 
administrateur;
<B><LI>les mises à jour</B> régulières couvrantes modifications apportées aux 
programmes et aux exigences législatives. 
</UL>
Les transporteurs peuvent obtenir les services du consortium ou de plus amples renseignements 
en s'adressant à une association provinciale du camionnage. «Le consortium offre l'avantage de 
l'achat en bloc ce qui permet de fournir aux transporteurs des services de la plus haute qualité 
au prix le plus raisonnable, auxquels leurs chauffeurs auront accès partout en Amérique du Nord 
pendant leurs voyages», a expliqué M. Montague. Le dépistage d'alcool et de stupéfiants en 
milieu de travail présente de nombreux débouchés aux fournisseurs de services. En vertu de la 
réglementation américaine, les transporteurs sont tenus de transiger avec des fournisseurs 
qualifiés seulement. Le marché regorge de fournisseurs de tous les niveaux. Certains promettent 
des services qu'ils ne peuvent livrer et d'autres ne répondent pas aux exigences rigoureuses. 
Barrie Montague fait la mise en garde suivante: «Le consortium de transporteurs routiers 
canadiens a permis de réunir des fournisseurs informés et compétents. Ils connaissent les 
exigences américaines sur le dépistage de même que le contexte législatif canadien qui sert de 
cadre d'application à ces règlements.»<P>

<H2>Industry Moves Toward Employee and 
Public Safety </H2>
The motor carrier industry has always been concerned with safety. The industry is now moving 
beyond concern and toward developing and implementing policies that allow carriers to meet 
their safety obligations to the public and to their employees. <P>
In the late 1980s, prompted in part by several accidents involving impairment, both Canada and 
the United States governments announced their intention to enact substance-use testing 
legislation in the motor carrier industry. The Canadian trucking industry backed the move, 
declaring zero tolerance for substance abuse by drivers. "The industry wants to do what is 
right," says Gilles Bélanger, president of CTA. "As far as we are concerned, one accident 
where drugs or alcohol is involved is one accident too many. We are not out to 'punish' anyone 
for drug or alcohol use. We are concerned with safety and view this as a preventive measure." 
<P>
The United States was quickly able to adopt legislation on substance-use testing. Under the 
1991 Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act (and subsequent amendments), employers 
must test certain drivers (including truck drivers) for the use of alcohol and five controlled 
substances, which are listed in the Controlled Substances and Alcohol Use and Testing Rules 
set out by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration. <P>
The rules made under the amended 1991 Act have applied to U.S. companies employing 50 or 
more drivers since January l, 1995. Covering more than 6.5 million drivers in the U.S., the Act, 
which includes testing, specifies that each year 50 per cent of all drivers be randomly tested for 
drug use and 25 per cent for alcohol use. <P>
A temporary exemption was granted to foreign drivers operating in the U.S. Canada's reprieve 
was based on the understanding that we would enact reciprocal legislation "in the near future." 
<P>
<H4>Transport Canada Takes The Driver's Seat</H4>
Transport Canada moved quickly on that promise, and with support and input from affected 
organizations such as CTA, the department began to develop substance-use legislation . <P>
To determine how a policy might work and what elements it should (and should not) 
encompass, Transport Canada and the B.C. Trucking Association undertook a pilot project 
which included input from other interested stakeholders. <P>
The project consisted of two main elements: consent review of what drivers would reveal about 
their own drug and/or alcohol use, and consent testing. According to Bélanger, it was a good 
learning experience. "The government got a firsthand look at what would and wouldn't work, 
and the project heightened the industry's awareness of the issues involved." <P>
Because most carriers believed that federal legislation would be imminent, few companies 
attempted to develop their own alcohol and drug policies. "Most companies have been waiting 
to ensure that any policy they put in place would comply with the government's regulations," 
explains CTA's executive director, Laura Kilgour. But a few companies, particularly those that 
derive considerable revenues from North/South routes, have initiated and implemented their 
own programs. <P>
Imperial Oil has one of the most comprehensive workplace alcohol and drug programs now in 
place. Launched three years ago, it already covers approximately 800 employees in safety-
sensitive positions, and has recently been extended beyond the company's own corporate 
boundaries. Imperial Oil will soon require that any "outside" carrier working on its behalf 
institute a similar program within their own trucking operations. <P>
<H4>Industry Takes Over  </H4>
After nearly five years spent developing the legislative framework for a Canadian alcohol and 
drug policy for the motor carrier industry, the federal government dropped out of the process 
late last year. The government's decision caught the trucking industry by surprise, and left it 
virtually on its own to develop appropriate policies and programs. <P>
Completing the task has now become a matter of considerable urgency, since sometime in 
1996, U.S. rules will be extended to all foreign drivers operating in the U.S. The problem is 
further complicated because (at the time of writing) the U.S. has not yet published the final rules 
for foreign drivers. <P>
Not surprisingly, many carriers are anxious to formulate and implement workplace substance-
use testing programs that will comply with U.S. rules. While the concern is understandable, says 
Kilgour, companies must ensure that any policies and testing programs are developed carefully, 
otherwise, they may not withstand the scrutiny of the Canadian Human Rights Act.<P>
<H4>Human Rights At Issue  </H4>
As Kilgour explains, the legislative environment in Canada differs considerably from its neighbor 
to the south, where substance-use programs are covered by legislation. The Canadian Human 
Rights Act views current or former dependency on alcohol or a drug as a "disability." Therefore, 
employers who limit or reduce opportunities  for example, fire or refuse to hire  on the basis 
of alcohol or drug dependency, may be accused of discrimination. As a result, employers must 
act in a manner not discriminatory under human rights legislation. "We cannot simply take the 
American rules and apply them to Canada," Kilgour stresses. "Our policies and programs must 
be made in Canada, by Canadians to fit the Canadian context." <P>
When the Minister of Transport announced his decision not to go ahead with legislation, motor 
carrier associations immediately formed a coalition to review the proposed U.S. Department of 
Transport rules on alcohol and drug-use testing as they would apply to foreign drivers, and to 
determine what impediments to compliance the Canadian legislative system might pose. The 
Canadian, provincial and regional trucking associations have studied all the program 
components necessary to develop comprehensive Canadian policies that balance health and 
safety concerns with respect for individual privacy. <P>
The associations are being aided by Barbara Butler, a consultant who specializes in designing 
policies, programs and communication strategies that address workplace substance abuse. 
Butler is the author of <I>Alcohol and Drugs in the Workplace</I>. The trucking industry 
believes that its first priority is to ensure the health and safety of its employees and the public. 
"Satisfying the immediate legislative requirements is part of the much larger and more important 
issue: ensuring health and safety," says Kilgour. Any programs must be well balanced between 
preventing problems, providing assistance for those who need it and deterring drivers and other 
employees from the use of illicit drugs and irresponsible use of alcohol and medications. <P>
Several studies have documented the consequences of substance abuse in the workplace. The 
list includes increased turnover, accidents and absenteeism, as well as rising compensation, sick 
leave and insurance costs. Add to these loss of productivity and human potential, and the  
potential for theft and trafficking, and it is immediately apparent why workplace alcohol and 
drug policies are simply good business practices. Substance-use programs must be developed 
to reflect the unique corporate culture and values of a company, the regulatory environment in 
which it operates, and most importantly, its specific program needs, cautions Butler. <P>
The first step is to develop a formal written statement of the company's position on alcohol and 
drugs. This policy should:<P>
<UL>
<LI>define the scope and application of the program; 
<LI>clarify the responsibilities of the employer and employees; 
<LI>indicate methods of identifying problems; 
<LI>specify the consequences of policy violation; 
<LI>address security issues; and 
<LI>outline procedures for implementation. 
</UL>
Once the basic employment-policy requirements are satisfied, the company can draw up the 
actual substance abuse program. <P>
CTA and the provincial associations are currently developing a package which will cover policy 
and program development, as well as employee education and supervisor training. They are also 
creating a consortium to provide the various related services that a testing program may require, 
including sample collections, lab or breath testing, medical review, and employee assistance 
programs. <P>
In the minds of many carriers however, one question still looms large: Will the Canadian trucking 
industry be ready to meet the FHWA's (proposed) 1996 deadline? <P>
"We will have a program in place in time to help Canadian carriers meet the FHWA's deadline," 
says Kilgour. In the meantime, however, the CTA reminds the industry that meeting the U.S. 
requirements is but one short-term  albeit crucial  goal in the long-term process of 
guaranteeing employee and public safety.  <P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME = substance></A>Summer 1995</H3>
<H2>Substance Abuse Policies in the 
Workplace</H2>
As reported last quarter  <P>
<I>In the absence of government legislation, the trucking industry has been working 
diligently to develop a workplace substance abuse program which includes seminars and 
a consortium of training and testing services. The program is based on industry-wide 
concern for the health and safety of its employees and the public. The program decisions 
are further complicated in that carriers whose drivers operate south of the border may be 
required to comply with complex and extensive U.S. drug and alcohol testing regulations, 
sometime in early 1996. At the time of writing, the final US rulemaking for foreign 
drivers had not been published. </I><P><I>
</I>In June, CTA and the provincial associations embarked on the all important first step with 
the launching of a series of seminars entitled "How to Develop a Policy to Implement a Drug 
and Alcohol Program," developed by Barbara Butler, a consultant on substance abuse policy 
development. "<P>
Policy development is the cornerstone of any substance abuse program in the trucking industry," 
says Laura Kilgour, CTA's Executive Director. Kilgour stresses that while there is no template, 
no blanket solution that can be applied to the industry as a whole  "Each company must 
develop a program to meet its own unique needs," she explains  every policy must fulfill 
certain minimum requirements. It must: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Be written and communicated; 
<LI>Provide clear direction; 
<LI>Outline applicable rules; 
<LI>Clarify opportunities for assistance; and 
<LI>Set out consequences for policy violation. 
</UL>
Kilgour also emphasizes that the implications of the Canadian legal environment must be 
factored into any substance-abuse policy decisions. These legal issues include: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Direct Liabilities - for the actions of impaired employees in the course of their work 
(organizations are liable for the negligent or wrongful acts committed by an employee in the 
course of employment) and in terms of hosting others; 
<LI>Occupational Health and Safety - due diligence responsibility around workplace safety 
(the onus is placed on employers to ensure the health, safety and welfare of employees and to 
prove due diligence in minimizing safety risks); and 
<LI>Human Rights Laws - responsibilities to accommodate employees with a disability, which 
includes a current or former dependency on alcohol or drugs (liability and safety concerns 
associated with impaired performance must be balanced with the protection provided by the 
law for substance dependent individuals who may be considered disabled). 
</UL>
A clear, well-communicated policy which is reasonably and consistently enforced, is the best 
means by which to address these issues...which is one reason the industry has developed its 
seminars. Among other things, the seminars being offered by the provincial associations will help 
carriers formulate a corporate policy that strikes a balance between due diligence and respect 
for individual privacy. <P>
CTA cautions carriers that workplace substance abuse program development is a highly 
complex issue about which there is considerable confusion and misinformation. <P>
"Workplace substance abuse testing is an area that presents many opportunities for service 
providers," Kilgour adds. "And not all of them are familiar with the particular requirements of the 
Canadian legal environment. So I would caution carriers not to be fooled by promises of quick 
solutions. Look carefully before you leap. The success of any carrier's substance abuse program 
is contingent upon expert guidance provided by qualified service providers. <P>
"We urge carriers to take advantage of the seminars being offered by the provincial and regional 
trucking associations. We have sought the best advice we know to be available and the 
seminars have been developed by an expert in (Canadian) workplace alcohol and drug 
programs".<P>
The three half-day seminar program, which is directed at CEOs, presidents and senior level 
managers, addresses such key areas as:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Defining objectives, applying your policy and meeting the required standards; 
<LI>Understanding the applicable rules and responsibilities; 
<LI>Prevention components in the areas of education and training; 
<LI>Making difficult decisions on issues such as safety-sensitive positions, alcohol and drug 
testing, hosting, searches, dealing with contractors, and consequences for policy violations; and 
<LI>Implementation and communication vehicles. 
</UL>
CTA and the provincial associations are also establishing a consortium of highly qualified and 
experienced service providers to work with the industry in providing services in the following 
key areas: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Employee assistance programs; 
<LI>Employee education programs (training, written/video material);
<LI>Supervisor training ( a requirement under the U.S. regulations); 
<LI>Alcohol and drug testing, including sample collection; and 
<LI>Medical review. 
</UL>
The consortium, which will be able to reap the benefits of bulk purchasing, will provide carriers 
with a full range of services at a reasonable price. This will eliminate the burden of having to 
contract directly with source providers for testing and related functions. <P>
Details about these programs and services are available through your provincial trucking 
association.<P>

Use:  The countdown to compliance </H2>
<I>In the Spring and Summer issues of CTA Magazine we reported on workplace policy 
development and the program launched by your trucking associations to address 
substance use issues concerning fitness for duty and the health and safety of carrier 
employees and the public within the Canadian legal context. This national venture, with 
one-stop shopping capabilities to access the best service providers in Canada, will assist 
carriers to meet all Canadian program needs while simultaneously allowing for 
compliance with the recently published US requirements.</I><P>
The long-awaited ruling by the United States Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on drug 
and alcohol testing for foreign-based drivers of motor carriers operating in the United States 
holds no surprises. As expected, the rules covering US employees are extended to all foreign-
based drivers and employers. The rules are complex and the following contains only an 
overview of the regulations. Every carrier affected should purchase a complete copy of the rules 
(available from all provincial trucking associations) .<P>
These US regulations are only one part of the issues which must be addressed by a Canadian 
carrier implementing a substance abuse program in their workplace. It is strongly recommended 
that a carrier seek professional advise on policy development, such as the seminar on policy 
development offered by all provincial trucking associations, before designing any program or 
contracting with any service providers.<P>
<H4>When must companies comply</H4>
In order to "provide consistency and fairness to foreign employers," the FHWA has provided a 
two-tier implementation phase-in period consistent with the phase-in previously provided to US 
employers. The implementation dates for compliance with US requirements are:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>July 1, 1996 for large foreign based employers:</B> 50 or more drivers 
assigned to operate commercial motor vehicles in North America as at December 17, 1995. 
<B><LI>July 1, 1997 for small foreign employers:</B> less than 50 drivers assigned to 
operate commercial motor vehicles in North America as at December 17, 1995. 
</UL>
Compliance is based on the number of drivers assigned by a company (including employees, 
owner/operators or contractors) no matter how many of them travel into the US. For example, 
explains CTA director, member services Laura Kilgour, "if a Canadian trucking company 
assigns 55 drivers of whom only five have the potential to drive south of the border, the 
company must meet the US alcohol and drug testing requirements for those five drivers." In this 
context, a driver is every person who operates a commercial motor vehicle with a gross vehicle 
rating of 26,001 or more pounds; or a bus designed to transport 16 or more passengers 
(including the driver); or a vehicle of any size placarded for the transportation of hazardous 
materials. <P>
<H4>Driver responsibilities </H4>
<B>Alcohol:</B> the regulations prohibit on duty possession or use, use for four hours prior 
to duty, use for eight hours after certain accidents, and having a blood alcohol level of 0.02 or 
greater while on duty. <P>
<B>Drugs:</B> The regulation mandates testing for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, 
amphetamines and phencyclidine (PCP). However, the use of <B>any controlled 
substance</B> is prohibited except under the instructions of a physician who has confirmed 
that the substance will not impair safe operation of a vehicle.<P>
<H4>Company responsibilities: </H4>
The employer must:<P>
<UL>
<LI>have a workplace policy which is communicated to its employees;
<LI>provide education for supervisors and access to assistance for employees;
<LI>on hiring any driver obtain, with the applicant's consent, the testing history from previous 
employers (for the past two years);
<LI>require drivers to undertake specified substance tests;.
<LI>remove from duty any driver who has violated the rules; and
<LI>prepare and maintain specified records .
</UL>
<H4>What testing is required </H4>
Testing for drugs must be through analysis of urine by a certified laboratory with positive tests 
confirmed by a qualified Medical Review Officer (MRO). Testing for alcohol must he by the use 
of an approved evidentiary breath testing devise operated by a trained technician (other certified 
tests may be used for initial screening only) and in association with a "duty period." There are a 
variety of circumstances when testing is mandated:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Pre-employment - (for drugs only);
<LI>With reasonable suspicion of a rule violation, based on a trained supervisor's specific and 
document observations;
<LI>Within a designated time frame after specified accidents;
<LI>Randomly (unannounced) at a minimum annual rate of 25 per cent of the driver pool for 
alcohol and 5() per cent for drugs;
<LI>On return from duty after removal for prohibited conduct; and
<LI>Randomly as follow-up, for at least a year, on return to duty after an assessment by a 
Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) identifies the need to resolve a problem with alcohol or 
drug misuse.
</UL>
<H4>Consequences of a positive test: </H4>
The regulations clearly define the consequences for any driver found in violation of the drug and 
alcohol regulations. Refusal to test equals a positive test. A positive test requires immediate 
removal from duty:<P>
<UL>
<LI>for at least 24 hours where an alcohol test result is between 0.02 and 0.039 BAC;
<LI>referral I for SAP evaluation where an alcohol test is 0.04 BAC or greater or a drug test is 
positive (return to duty only following completion of any rehabilitation program prescribed by 
the SAP and a negative return to duty test.
</UL>
<H4>Canadian Motor Carrier Consortium </H4>
That the American regulations are to be extended to foreign companies operating in the US 
comes as no surprise to the Canadian trucking industry. "We believed the exemption was 
temporary and have been preparing for compliance." But, stresses Laura Kilgour, "the industry 
associations have been tailoring their policies and programs to fit within the Canadian legislative 
environment, and, more importantly, to address health and safety concerns." For the past year, 
the provincial trucking associations, in conjunction with the CTA and with the assistance of a 
consultant who specializes in workplace substance abuse, have been helping the trucking 
industry to design policies and implement programs. "The establishment of the Canadian motor 
carrier consortium and development of its programs was achieved mainly through the leadership 
and dedicated effort of the staff of the Ontario Trucking Association (OTA)," states 
Kilgour.<P>
Since last summer, the provincial trucking associations have provided a series of seminars 
across Canada entitled How to Develop a <I>Policy to Implement </I>a Drug and 
<I>Alcohol </I>Program presented by Barbara Butler, a noted policy expert. Several hundred 
carriers have attended the policy seminars which will continue to be provided by the provincial 
associations as demand requires.<P>
"With the dates for compliance looming large on the horizon, the trucking associations 
consortium has developed further products and services to provide 'one-stop shopping' for all 
motor carriers, whether for-hire, private or bus operations," explains Barrie Montague, manager 
of operations at the OTA.<P>
The consortium services, which can be purchased in whole or in part, include:<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>alcohol and drug testing</B>, including sample collection sites throughout Canada 
and lab analysis;
<B><LI>random testing program maintenance</B> through a third party administrator 
providing selection using sophisticated and unbiased software;
<B><LI>medical review officer and substance abuse professional coordination</B> 
with fully qualified MRO's and a list of SAP's located across the country available to consortium 
members;
<B><LI>employee assistance programs</B> (EAP), an important link in preventing and 
assisting with substance use problems, is an optional service which, because of the expected 
high volumes, will provide competitive prices available to all consortium members - big or small;
<B><LI>supervisor training</B> to address both practical and legislative requirements;
<B><LI>employee education programs and materials</B> with access to a menu of 
consortium approved material in both written and video format with high volumes meaning lower 
prices to consortium members;
<B><LI>record keeping and administration</B> through the third party administrator;
<B><LI>information updates</B> on a regular basis to keep abreast of changing program 
and legislative requirements . 
</UL>
Carriers can obtain the consortium services or more information by contacting any provincial 
trucking association. "The consortium provides the benefit of bulk buying so that carriers will 
have access to the highest level of service at the most reasonable cost while their drivers will 
have North American access as they travel," explains Montague. The area of workplace 
substance abuse testing opens many opportunities for service providers. Carriers are 
responsible under the US regulations to contract only with qualified providers. There are many 
levels of service providers in the marketplace, some promise services which they can't deliver 
and others do not meet the exacting requirements. "The Canadian motor carrier consortium has 
brought together knowledgeable and experienced service providers. They understand the US 
testing requirements but also the Canadian legislative context in which those rules must be 
applied," stressed Barrie Montague.<P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.nicsl.coled.umn.edu/">National Service-Learning
Cooperative Clearinghouse (NSLCC)</A> is pleased to announce that we have
broadened our scope by becoming part of the <A HREF="http://ericir.syr.edu/">Educational
Resources Information Center (ERIC)</A>. Our new role as the Adjunct ERIC
Clearinghouse on Service-Learning, in cooperation with the <A HREF="http://www.indiana.edu/~ssdc/eric-chess.html">ERIC
Clearinghouse for Social Studies/Social Science Education (ERIC/ChESS)</A>,
will allow us to provide greater access to service-learning resources through
the ERIC database and distribution system.</P>

<P><B>ABOUT NSLCC</B><BR>
The National Service-Learning Cooperative Clearinghouse was created in 1993
as a central location to collect and disseminate information about service-learning
programs, resources, events, as well as people and organizations involved
in the field. NSLCC supports teachers, administrators, community-based practitioners,
public officials, and researchers in identifying appropriate resources through
the NSLCC database. Access to this database is provided via staff searches,
the NSLCC Web site, and through NSLCC publications. Our services, available
to anyone with an interest in service-learning, can be obtained:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>by phone: <B>(800) - 808 - SERV (7378)</B><BR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>ABOUT ERIC AND ADJUNCT ERIC CLEARINGHOUSES</B><BR>
The ERIC information system is the primary reference and source of documents
in the education field. The ERIC database contains abstracted and indexed
records for over one million resources. By establishing the Adjunct ERIC
Clearinghouse on Service-Learning, we will provide more comprehensive coverage
of service-learning within the ERIC information system, improve search access
to resources through ERIC abstracting and indexing, and increase availability
to these materials through distribution by the <A HREF="http://edrs.com/">ERIC
Document Reproduction Service (EDRS)</A>. NSLCC will continue to maintain
and expand its database, continue to refer patrons directly to relevant
sources of information, and continue to collect information and materials
beyond the scope of ERIC.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>CALL FOR RESOURCES</B></P>

<P>As an author or publisher in the field of service-learning, you can assist
us in providing comprehensive coverage and access to service-learning literature
by contributing your resources for inclusion in the National Service Learning
Cooperative Clearinghouse (NSLCC) and ERIC information systems. ERIC seeks
curriculum guides, conference papers and speeches, studies, program evaluations,
bibliographies, opinion papers and other monographs relating to service-learning.
In addition to these materials, NSLCC also seeks videos and other media
resources.</P>

<P>There are many advantages to including your resource in the NSLCC and
ERIC systems:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Retrievability</B> - Bibliographic descriptions can be retrieved
  by thousands of people from two databases available on the Web, through
  CD-Rom, and through print indexes found at local libraries.
  <LI><B>Dissemination</B> - NSLCC directs its patrons to your distribution
  source if it is still available. By signing the ERIC Reproduction Release
  agreement, copies of your resource also become available permanently through
  ERIC's Document Reproduction Service (EDRS) and through libraries subscribing
  to ERIC. The presence of a master microfiche at EDRS means that documents
  are always available.
  <LI><B>Publicity</B> - Resources accepted by ERIC are announced monthly
  in Resources in Education (RIE). You may also choose to have your distribution
  location and the resource's price announced in RIE.
</UL>

<P>In order to be included in both information systems, we need <B>two clear,
legible copies of each resource</B>. If you have already donated a resource
to the NSLCC system, we may request additional copies in order to submit
your resource to ERIC. In this case we have enclosed a Resource Request
form listing the specific resource(s) that we are requesting along with
the number of copies we need to complete processing.</P>

<P>In order to refer NSLCC patrons to the source where they can obtain your
publications directly, we need you to complete a <B>Source Information form</B>.
If we already list your organization as a source, we have provided a completed
Source Information form -- you need only verify that the information is
correct or indicate necessary changes.</P>

<P>In order to allow distribution of your resource through EDRS we need
a <B>signed Reproduction Release</B> for each resource.</P>

<P>We greatly appreciate your assistance and your timely response to this
request. On behalf of all who have an interest in service-learning, we thank
you for your contributions.<BR>

<P><A NAME="anchor263886"></A><B>Introduction</B><BR>
Beginning in December 1996 the National Service-Learning Cooperative Clearinghouse
newsletter, National Service-Learning Cooperative Clearinghouse Update will
be published bi-monthly as an electronic bulletin. Contained in it will
be specific information available from the Clearinghouse. Additionally,
specific programs, practices, and research issues will be highlighted.</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor264791"></A><B>Overview</B><BR>
In this edition we present articles on several current topics. Rob Shumer,

<P><A NAME="anchor266362"></A><B>Service and Sports: NCAA Might Mean Not
Categorically Academically Acceptable</B><BR>
Recent newspaper articles (during the last week of September) have called
attention to the refusal of the NCAA to honor scholarships to athletes because
some of their high school courses were too &quot;applied&quot; and not academic.
If one of the definitions of &quot;academic&quot; found in the dictionary
is &quot;of theoretical, not practical value,&quot; then all service-learning
courses could be considered non-academic. While clearly this is not the
case, the perception by many in secondary and post-secondary institutions
is courses which focus on learning by doing, especially in community contexts,
are not as rigorous and academically challenging as classroom-based instruction.
This perception, if perpetrated through state standards which are being
developed all across the country, could greatly damage the ability of service-learning
courses and instructors to be perceived as academically credible. This is
an age old problem, but clearly one that must be met head on by all who
include community experience as part of the instructional program and plan
to give academic credit for the experiential component.</P>

<P>What should we do about this? It is important that service-learning practitioners
confer with others in their academic communities to ensure that service-learning
courses do have theoretical bases and do contain academically acceptable
skills and concepts. We need to impress upon our colleagues that, indeed,
most theory is learned through practice, and most field experiences in service
programs are included in rigorous, reflective exercises which extract important
learning from the service activities. Failure to do this may open up the
field to more criticism about the limited learning dimensions of service-learning.</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor268044"></A><B>Research/Evaluation/Assessment</B><BR>
There are several national initiatives which are beginning to expand our
knowledge and skills in the areas of research, evaluation, and assessment.
The following projects cited indicate there is, indeed, interest and momentum
to improve both the information and the methodology of learning more about
service-learning.</P>

<P>The Corporation for National Service has funded the Vermont Department
of Education to lead a national study group on assessing student achievement.
The groups met at the end of October to begin their plans for the upcoming
year. They will be focusing on initiatives to develop state plans for action.
More information will be forthcoming next month.</P>

<P>The Search Institute has received a small grant from the W.K. Kellogg
Foundation to convene a group of researchers/evaluators to discuss important
issues in studying service-learning. Dr.Dale Blyth is serving as project
director for the initiative. Participants first convened at the National
Service-Learning Conference in Detroit this year to develop guidelines and
purposes for the group. Information will be reported periodically as they
develop plans for activities.</P>

<P>Dr. Alan Waterman, in collaboration with several researchers/evaluators
around the country, is producing a new book on research for the service-learning
field. The book, <I>Service-Learning: Applications from the Research</I>,
should be available early next year. It covers a variety of topics, including
what we have learned from qualitative and qualitative research.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="anchor269951"></A><B>We've Become an ERIC Adjunct
Clearinghouse for Service-Learning!</B><BR>
by Gail Klosterman, Library Developer</P>

<P>The National Service-Learning Cooperative Clearinghouse (NSLCC) is pleased
to announce that we have broadened our scope by becoming part of the Educational
Resources Information Center (ERIC). Our new role as the Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse
on Service-Learning, in cooperation with the ERIC Clearinghouse for Social
Studies/Social Science Education (ERIC/ChESS), will allow us to provide
greater access to service-learning resources through the ERIC database and
distribution system.</P>

<P><B>About ERIC and Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouses</B><BR>
The ERIC information system is the primary reference and source of documents
in the education field. The ERIC database contains abstracted and indexed
records for close to 900,000 resources. Each year, records for more than
30,000 new resources are added to the database. By establishing the Adjunct
ERIC Clearinghouse on Service-Learning, we will provide more comprehensive
coverage of service-learning within the ERIC information system, improve
search access to resources through ERIC abstracting and indexing, and increase
availability to these materials through distribution by the ERIC Document
Reproduction Service (EDRS). NSLCC will continue to maintain and expand
its proprietary database, continue to refer patrons directly to relevant
sources of information, and continue to collect information and materials
beyond the scope of ERIC.</P>

<P><B>Call for Resources</B><BR>
NSLCC seeks contributions of published and unpublished resources dealing
with service-learning, national and community service, youth development
and experiential learning.</P>

<P>If you have authored or published resources in the field of service-learning,
you can assist us in providing comprehensive coverage and access to service-learning
literature by contributing your resources for inclusion in the National
Service Learning Cooperative Clearinghouse (NSLCC) and ERIC information
systems.</P>

<P>We seek curriculum guides, conference papers and speeches, studies, program
evaluations, bibliographies, opinion papers and other monographs relating
to service-learning for the NSLCC and ERIC collections. We also seek videos
and other media resources.</P>

<P><B>There are many advantages to including your resource in the NSLCC
and ERIC systems:</B></P>

<P><B>Retrievability</B> - Bibliographic descriptions can be retrieved by
thousands of people from two databases available on the Web, through CD-Rom,
and through print indexes found at local libraries.</P>

<P><B>Dissemination</B> - NSLCC directs its patrons to your distribution
source if it is still available. By signing an ERIC Reproduction Release
agreement, copies of your resource also become available permanently through
ERIC's Document Reproduction Service (EDRS) and through libraries subscribing
to ERIC. The presence of a master microfiche at EDRS means that documents
are always available.</P>

<P><B>Publicity</B> - Resources accepted by ERIC are announced monthly in
Resources in Education (RIE). You may also choose to have your distribution
location and the resource's price announced in RIE.</P>

<P>If you have resources you wish to contribute, please call us at 1-800-808-SERV
(7378) and request a Resource Contribution packet.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="anchor274522"></A><B>Getting the Most Out of the
Clearinghouse Phone and Electronic Resources</B><BR>
by Maddie Hengel, PhD. Student, Information Specialist</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are many types of questions asked by those who phone the Clearinghouse.
Several types of responses can be provided by the Information Specialist
in answering the query. The purpose of this article is to help callers understand
the process of getting useable information, given by phone or from our Website.
One &quot;hot topic&quot; example is selected below to illustrate some of
the ways in which information can be selected from our Website.</P>

<P>As a working example, one current topic is &quot;Citizenship&quot;. Information
Specialists recognize   various questions which may involve community initiatives,
curriculum models, issues and problems in implementing and assessing programs
or classes involving civics, participation or citizenship. Some examples
of questions are: &quot;How can we address racial and ethnic tensions?&quot;
&quot;How can we work together to reduce violence and make the community
a safer place?&quot; &quot;What can we do to have a voice in creating our
community?&quot; Providing answers to these questions can help practitioners
and others to address difficult public problems, local issues, or to provide
civic education for young people and create intergenerational connections
in the community.</P>

<P>When using the Website, an inquirer can look through the homepage and
select the searchable databases section. In this section, searching literature
records by the keyword &quot;citizenship&quot; will yield about 52 abstracts
of articles, books and curriculum currently held in our library at the Clearinghouse,
or information on how to obtain these publications. Searching for &quot;citizenship,&quot;
in the programs portion of the database draws a selection of citizenship
programs across the country (currently we have about 15 in our database).
A review of the Helpful Resources from the Clearinghouse section of the
homepage includes Bibliographies and Publications sections, which contain
the topic bibliography on &quot;Civics, Social Studies and Service,&quot;
that may be downloaded and printed by the inquirer. More information can
be searched from the Service-Learning Elsewhere on the Web section of the
homepage, with links to National, Federal, and Higher Education sites, as
well as links to books, articles and publications. After viewing all of
the information on citizenship, you can leave us a message or enter information
about your program or conference online for inclusion in the national database.
To submit this information, use the Add Your Information Online link from
the homepage. You can also send us comments by using the link provided in
the Who Are We section of the homepage..</P>

<P>We recognize the importance of dialogue in responding to requests for
information, which is why we are pleased to offer opportunities for both
personal contact over the phone and self-serve internet resources. If you
have unanswered questions at any time, or do not have access to the Internet,
call the Clearinghouse at 800-808-SERVe, where an Information Specialist
will help you obtain information or refer you to our partners, other organizations,
or people who can help.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Searches are based on an implicit &quot;AND.&quot; If you search for
&quot;<KBD>evaluation</KBD>&quot;, you get back several dozen records containing
evaluation (probably part of the title). If you search for &quot;<KBD>shumer</KBD>&quot;,
you get back several dozen records containing shumer (probably part of the
author listing). Search for &quot;<KBD>shumer evaluation</KBD>&quot; or
&quot;<KBD>evaluation shumer</KBD>&quot;, however, and you get back one
record which includes both terms: &quot;Evaluation: the Key to Improving
Service Learning Programs&quot; by Marybeth Neal and Rob Shumer. 
  <LI>If you get a message saying &quot;out of memory&quot; or something
else cryptic, it means your term was too broad (classic example: &quot;<KBD>service&quot;</KBD>).
Use additional terms to narrow your question (example: &quot;<KBD>service
environment</KBD>&quot;) or, better yet, drop the general term in favor
of the more narrow one (example: &quot;<KBD>environment</KBD>&quot;). 
  <LI>If you get a message saying &quot;sorry, no entries matching '<I>whatever
you put in</I>' found in field 'html'&quot; , no matches were found. Try
a different search. 
  <LI>Searching is case-insensitive: &quot;<KBD>evaluation</KBD>,&quot;
&quot;EVALUATION,&quot; and &quot;<KBD>evalUATion</KBD>&quot; all bring
back the same records.

<H3><CENTER>Defining Service-Learning </CENTER>
</H3>
Service-learning means different things to different people. <BR>
Because of this, no one definition of service-learning will <BR>
satisfy everyone. Several commonly used definitions of service-<BR>
learning are presented here to provide a basis for discovering the <BR>
common ground among them and to promote discussion about the <BR>
meaning of service learning. <BR>
<HR>&quot;The term 'service-learning' means a method:<BR>
A) under which students learn and develop through active <BR>
participation in ...thoughtfully organized service <BR>
experiences that meet actual community needs;<BR>
B) that is integrated into the students' academic curriculum <BR>
or provides structured time for a student to think, talk, <BR>
or write about what the student did and saw during the <BR>
service activity;<BR>
C) that provides students with opportunities to use newly <BR>
acquired skills and knowledge in real-life situations in <BR>
their own communities; and<BR>
D) that enhances what is taught in school by extending <BR>
student learning beyond the classroom and into the <BR>
community and helps to foster the development of a sense <BR>
of caring for others.&quot;<BR>
<B>-National and Community Service Act of 1990<BR>
</B><BR>
<HR>&quot;Service learning appears to be an approach to experiential <BR>
learning, an expression of values -- service to others, which <BR>
determines the purpose, nature and process of social and <BR>
educational exchange between learners (students) and the people <BR>
they serve, and between experiential education programs and the <BR>
community organizations with which they work.&quot;<BR>
<B>- Timothy Stanton</B><BR>
<BR>
<HR>A Delphi Study (Shumer, 1993) sought consensus on a definition of <BR>
service-learning. The Executive Summary states: &quot;while there is <BR>
consensus on some aspects of service-learning, for the most part <BR>
there is still disagreement on the details.&quot; A brief summary of <BR>
the Delphi study's findings are as follows:<BR>
- There is consensus that service-learning can be envisioned <BR>
through forms, or types, and that these forms are best <BR>
understood through specific examples.<BR>
- There is general agreement that service-learning occurs in <BR>
two general categories: school-based and community-based.<BR>
- ...twenty-nine different dichotomous variables <BR>
('continua') were named ...which further describe purposes, <BR>
goals, processes, and settings of service-learning. All <BR>
these types and models provide a framework for <BR>
conceptualizing service-learning in its various <BR>
configurations; yet none of them are fixed or exact in <BR>
meaning or description.<BR>
- As powerful and as exciting as any educational innovation <BR>
and practice, ...service-learning is still very much an <BR>
amorphous concept which continues to resist rigid <BR>
definitions and universal understanding.<BR>
<B>-Robert Shumer</B><BR>
<BR>
<HR>&quot;...service-learning is both a program type and a philosophy of
<BR>
education.<BR>
As a program type, service-learning includes myriad ways that <BR>
students can perform meaningful service to their communities and to society
<BR>
while engaging in some form of reflection or study that is related <BR>
to the service.<BR>
As a philosophy of education, service-learning reflects the belief <BR>
that education must be linked to social responsibility and that <BR>
the most effective learning is active and connected to experience <BR>
in some meaningful way.&quot;<BR>
<B>-Research Agenda For Combining Service and Learning in the <BR>
1990s</B><BR>
<BR>
<HR>&quot;Service-learning is a method by which young people learn and <BR>
develop through active participation in thoughtfully-organized <BR>
service experiences...<BR>
- That meet actual community needs.<BR>
- That are coordinated in collaboration with the school and <BR>
...community.<BR>
- That are integrated into each young person's academic <BR>
curriculum.<BR>
- That provide the structured time for a young person to <BR>
think, talk, and write about what he/she did and saw during <BR>
the actual service activity.<BR>
- That provide young people with opportunities to use newly <BR>
acquired academic skills and knowledge in real life <BR>
situations in their own communities.<BR>
- That enhance what is taught in the school by extending <BR>
student learning beyond the classroom.<BR>
- That help to foster the development of a sense of caring <BR>
for others.<BR>

  Robert Shumer, Ph.D. This executive summary reports on the results of four
  qualitative studies conducted on service-learning programs in Minnesota.
  Two studies were done on school-based programs (K-8 and 9-12), one on a
  community youth organization, and one on a small district attempting to
  integrate service-learning into the curriculum. The report cites elements
  of exemplary practice discovered in the study, as well as issues raised
  by teachers about barriers to implementing service programs in schools.

  <LI><B>Describing Service-Learning - A Delphi Study. </B><BR>
  Rob Shumer, Ph.D. This report addresses the problem of defining service-learning.
  Based on a three round study which involved 25 service-learning practitioners
  and researchers, a list of service learning forms was developed. Defining
  11 school-based forms and 15 community-based forms of service-learning,
  the argument is made that service-learning is very complicated and that
  the concept still resists universal understanding. A good paper to stimulate
  discussion on the definition of service-learning. This report includes
  a detailed discussion of each form and example discovered through the Delphi
  process. (45 pages. $2.50 + S &amp; H) [Executive Summary: S &amp; H only]</LI>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">LISTSERVs, or &quot;list servers,&quot; grew
  out of a need to send a lot of people the same electronic mail (e-mail)
  message. A LISTSERV sends messages to all of the e-mail users on its list
  of &quot;subscribers.&quot; E-mail users can send a message to everyone
  on the list. They can also reply to someone else's message, either by writing
  back to them directly or posting the reply to the LISTSERV. One advantage
  of these &quot;e-mail- based discussion groups&quot; is that one needs
  only electronic mail to participate, rather than a full set of Internet
  resources.<BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+1>*What sorts of LISTSERVs are there?</FONT></B></P>

  resources and opportunities, follow and discuss legislative changes as
  they are debated, and wrestle with the more challenging aspects of service-learning.<BR>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>Introduction to the Purpose and Scope of this Bibliography</B><BR>
<BR>
The purpose of this resource is to provide the initiate to service-learning
with a condensed list of sources commonly used in the literature. This is
not a critical work, but a list of the most commonly identified articles,
books, and authors.<BR>
The references in this bibliography were compiled by cross-referencing seven
bibliographies on service-learning. Each of the references is a selection
that is identified by two or more of these seven sources. One problem in
choosing references in this manner is that some frequently cited authors
do not have a single article appear more than once and are, subsequently,
overlooked for inclusion in this compilation. Therefore, to make this bibliography
representative of the commonly identified references and authors, the works
of these authors are included in a separate section. <BR>

The sources listed on the following pages are in response to requests for
information on service-learning connections to issues of resiliency and
&quot;at-risk&quot; youth. They were obtained primarily by conducting searches
of the ERIC database on CD-ROM. Broad topics were chosen for a comprehensive
selection of references. These included: At-Risk, Citizenship, Service,
Resiliency, Community Involvement, Drop Outs, etc. With several hundred
records identified, only those with the closest relevance to the topic are
included here. Where a source is available through EDRS, an ERIC number
is included. In addition, references from several service-learning bibliographies
are included. The search for more sources of information on this topic is
ongoing and this compilation will be updated periodically.<BR>
<BR>
The items in this topic bibliography are divided into three sections. Section
One list those sources having the most direct relevance to service-learning
with at-risk persons. Section Two contains references for background and
related sources on at-risk youth which may help inform service-learning
practice with these populations. Section Three lists sources on vocational
and career development with at risk youth. The items within each section
are listed alphabetically by author's last name.<BR>
<BR>
Many of the items listed have been collected by ERIC and reproductions are
available by mail order. To obtain reproductions of the sources with ERIC
numbers, call the ERIC Document Reproduction Services (EDRS) at 1-800-443-ERIC
(3742) to place an order or to find out more about the services they provide.
For paper copies (PC), the price is $3.53 for each level: PC01(25 or fewer
pages)=$3.53, PC02(50 or fewer pages)=$7.06, etc. Most university libraries
have some or all of the journals containing articles not available through
EDRS. They may also have all of the ERIC records on micro fiche for public
use. Because- of copyright laws, N.I.C.S.L. is not able to reproduce material
in our reference collection.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NOTE: </B><BR>
<BR>
The use of the term &quot;at-risk&quot; is widespread, yet remains ambiguous
and usually operationally defined. Criteria for who is at-risk include economic
conditions, involvement with the criminal justice system, potential for
dropping out of school and levels of academic achievement significantly
below acceptable standards. The use of the term &quot;at-risk&quot; is problematic
in that it focuses attention on deficits and under emphasizes strengths
and possible resiliency factors.<BR>

This section lists the literature most closely linking service-learning
to at-risk and resiliency issues. These sources primarily describe specific
programs and program philosophies which involve &quot;at-risk&quot; youth
as performers of service. Those sources which describe activities including
learning and service are listed in this section. The term service-learning
is often used for a wider number of activities which do not necessarily
involve both service and learning. Since there is interest in career development
and vocationally-oriented activities for at-risk youth, sources related
to this topic are found in Section Three, Vocational and Career Development

TITLE: <B>Helping The Community: An Untapped Resource For Troubled Youth</B><BR>
JOURNAL CITATION: The Pointer; v26 n3 p29-33 Spr 1982.<BR>
<BR>
ABSTRACT: Youth need opportunities to participate in volunteer experiences
in order to get the benefits associated with helping. The residential group
treatment program at the Starr Commonwealth Schools immerses troubled youth
in an environment designed to emphasize the positive values of caring, helping,
trusting, and being responsible. Service-learning projects are important
ways of generalizing the helping process beyond peers and to the community.
Youth's self-centered beliefs are used to get them involved in service by
labeling it as a challenge or showing how they are needed by others. These
service-learning activities are often with senior citizens, younger children
and persons with disabilities. Projects can further be distinguished as
either pre-planned or spontaneous. An example of a pre-planned service-learning
activity is Starr Commonwealth students serving as volunteers with a 4H
&quot;Sitting Tall&quot; program for children with physical disabilities.
The students chose to volunteer after being presented with the idea. They
then prepared by learning about disabilities issues and received training
from the 4H staff. Journal writing provided reflection and a chance to integrate
the experience. Their participation was reinforced with recognition activities
and publicity. Volunteering for sandbagging in a nearby town during a flood
is an example of a spontaneous project. The youth worked as a team and provided
valuable help to a community in need. Benefits from service-learning observed
in students included: bonding which carried over to other activities, greater
academic motivation, sensitivity to persons with disabilities, awareness
of aging and death, insights into sources of others' perseverance and the
joy of helping. (RVB)<BR>

TITLE: <B>Youth Service: From Youth As Problems To Youth As Resources.</B><BR>
JOURNAL CITATION: Prevention Forum; v10 n2 pp. 6-14.<BR>
<BR>
ABSTRACT: This article reviews youth prevention paradigms and youth service
as a key element in prevention programming. It begins by arguing for a shift
away from conceptualizations of youth as problems to viewing youth as resources.
Education and prevention policies based on the problem paradigm deny youth
the opportunities to be useful contributing members of society. Problem
oriented prevention programs focus on individual change strategies when
research shows, instead, the significance of participation in meaningful
activities as a factor in resilient youth - youth who have become health
adults in spite of adversity. Participation in socially useful tasks show
positive results in self-esteem and moral development, whereas non participation
is associated with self-destructive and anti-social behaviors. Participation,
then, is perhaps the most critical protective factor in preventing social
problems and alienation. Youth service - youth working in the school or
community performing socially needed tasks - is identified as a prevention
approach based on youth as resources and a way of providing opportunities
for participation. A review of youth service literature highlights five
rationales for youth service: 1) it promotes healthy psychological, intellectual
and social development of youth, 2) youth service helps youth assume adult
responsibilities, 3) there is much work which needs to be done, one estimate
suggesting there are three and a half million service positions for youth,
4) the creativity of youth is needed to address social problems of the present
and future, and 5) youth service builds linkages between school and community
increasing the relevance of education to life and experience to education.
A synthesis of recommendations from the youth service field yields guidelines
for developing programs which include community control over programs, the
need to emphasize the benefits of service to both society and to youth,
the need for rewarding service, the necessity of a high degree of youth
involvement and ownership of programs as well as time for reflection and
discussion as an essential element. The primary conclusion is that youth
service opportunities must be a key component of comprehensive prevention
programming. (RVB)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Service learning has been found to be a potentially powerful dropout
prevention tool. Service learning combines community service with learning
activities. Participating students must be engaged in significant, well-planned,
and genuine service. Second, they must reflect on their experiences of serving
others to ensure a complete learning experience. These requirements are
vital to a successful service learning experience. Many favorable outcomes
occur in each of the following developmental areas through participation
in service learning activities: personal growth; social growth; intellectual
growth; citizenship; and preparation for the world of work. Service learning
can be integrated into the organizational structure of a school through
four progressively complex levels of implementation: extracurricular; curricular
unit; mandatory or elective courses; and school-wide integration. Essential
components of service learning include preparation, action, and reflection.
The service learning continuum can be implemented at all grade levels. Research
has shown that the integration of service learning into the school curriculum
is an extremely effective strategy in meeting the many developmental needs
of all students. Service learning is a teaching methodology that revitalizes
the classroom and provides the kind of learning and experiences students
need to lead a successful life. (ERIC)<BR>
<BR>
SERVICE-LEARNING CONNECTION: This booklet deals primarily with a detailed
description of service-learning. Although no explicit application of service-learning
is suggested for &quot;at-risk&quot; youth, the introduction suggests potential
for service-learning as a drop-out prevention tool:<BR>
Analysis by the National Dropout Prevention Center [see Duckenfield et al.
Section 2] revealed that twelve strategies were seen to be most successful
in dropout prevention. Several of these practices-especially mentoring and
tutoring, flexible schedules and alternative programs, school-based management,
community and business collaboration, and workforce readiness and career
counseling-are strong components of a well-designed school-based service
learning program. Other researchers [Peck et al. (1989) Dropout Prevention:
What we have learned. Ann Arbor, MI: ERIC Counseling and Personnel Services
Clearing House] have determined that successful programs for at-risk youth
should incorporate course work which emphasizes practical, real-world problem
solving; experiential, hands-on learning; and experiences with responsible
and mature adults. These same components are fundamental to service learning
programs. Thus, service learning combines the best dropout prevention practices
with an innovative way to reach students at risk. (p. 6)<BR>

ABSTRACT: The emerging youth service movement has reinforced and built on
the foundation of service in traditional organizations and focuses on tapping
youth talent and energy. Youth service is a concept that has roots in pre-20th
century American society. Service programs today increasingly include training,
education, prevention, and employment components. In addition, participating
&quot;at-risk&quot; youth sense the value of the work and increase their
self-esteem. The following service programs for disadvantaged youth are
described: (1) the Juvenile Justice Alliance in Portland (Oregon); (2) SerVermont
in Chester (Vermont); (3) Valued Youth Partnership Program in San Antonio
(Texas); (4) Magic Me in Baltimore (Maryland); (5) Project OASES (Occupational
and Academic Skills for the Employment of Students) in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania);
(6) Clean and Green Program in Los Angeles (California); and (7) Early Adolescent
Helper Program in New York (New York). In addition, there have been several
recent federal initiatives promoting youth services. National groups have
emerged as leading advocates of youth service and helped to support programs
operating outside established service networks. Policy considerations include
defining the federal role, increasing options for low-income youth, maximizing
the benefits, and avoiding abuses. A chart detailing the federal initiatives
and a list of national organizations that support service programs are included.

ABSTRACT: The inability to maintain or form effective interpersonal relationships
is a near universal element in definitions for classifying persons as seriously
emotionally disturbed. Exposure to caring teachers or teaching caring as
a classroom unit will not necessarily develop caring behavior and values.
Even the development of positive peer subcultures among delinquent adolescents
face two problems: &quot;How can helping and caring be transferred to the
real world?&quot; and &quot;How can self-centered youth learn to genuinely
care about others?&quot; Service-learning at the The Starr Commonwealth
Schools--nonprofit residential treatment centers for boys and girls--have
been specifically designed to address these issues. Over 100 community service
projects each year allow otherwise narcissistic youth become a resource
to the community at large. An initial obstacle is making caring fashionable
to students notoriously self-centered. Service-learning programs capture
the commitment of troubled youth by appealing to their natural interests
and motivations. Projects involving people-to-people encounters are preferable
to depersonalized ones so that youth get experience positive interpersonal
relationships. These projects should start out simple and with a limited
time horizon. Recognition for service activities is the component used to
reward caring behavior. Typically, projects proceed through four stages:
identification of the project, orientation of students, implementation and
evaluation. Positive gains in self-esteem, responsibility and educational
achievement have been noted for The Starr Commonwealth Schools programs
incorporating service-learning. (RVB)<BR>
<BR>
SERVICE-LEARNING CONNECTION: Demonstrates usefulness of service-learning
in developing positive resiliency factors in youth and describes some of
the things to consider when targeting a program towards behaviorally disordered
youth. Though it discusses a residential-based program, the findings are
generalizable to other settings. <BR>

Chapter 2 &quot;The Valued Youth Partnership Program: Tutoring of Hispanic
'At-Risk' Elementary Students&quot; (pp. 10-27)<BR>
<BR>
Valued Youth Partnership's (VYP) guiding principle is to identify likely
school drop outs and enable them to believe they are valued young persons.
VYP defines &quot;at-risk&quot; as a student performing two grade levels
below satisfactory performance. Middle school at-risk youths perform service
by acting as peer tutors to elementary students. The program involves: 1)
an accredited course to develop communication skills and awareness of child
development, 2) tutoring sessions totaling 5-8 hours a week at the elementary
school for which the tutors are paid minimum wage, 3) field trips exposing
participants to a variety of cultural and economic opportunities and allowing
stronger relationships to develop, 4) role modeling by adult professionals,
and 5) family participation through periodic parent meetings. Evaluation
of the impact of VYP on tutors showed a 4% dropout rate over three years
compared to 45% for Hispanic students in all of Texas. Improved attitudes
toward home were also noted along with a demonstrated improvement in English
and math. Absenteeism and disciplinary problems were also low. (RVB)<BR>

Chapter 3 &quot;Project OASES: A Combined Academic / Community Alternative
for Potential Drop Outs&quot; (pp. 28-47)<BR>
<BR>
Since 1982 Occupational Academic Skills for the Employment of Students (OASES)
has been a structured alternative for Pittsburgh 8th grade potential drop
outs. Referral to OASES is based on students functioning behaviorally or
academically below acceptable standards. Criteria also include absences
and suspensions plus more positive indicators such as &quot;has indicated
the desire for a fresh start in a new school setting.&quot; Students admitted
to the OASES program spend half the day in academic classes and the rest
in OASES lab classes. In the labs, students learn vocational, building and
maintenance skills as a way of motivating them to improve attendance and
performance in school. Skills are applied in community service projects
for local nonprofit organizations. These projects are publicized and students
awarded for improved attendance and no suspensions. The impact of OASES
on students, as measured by improved grades and fewer absences, is significant.

Chapter 4 &quot;Clean and Green: A Program That Helps To Keep Middle School
Young People From Being Recruited into Gangs&quot; (pp. 48-57)<BR>
<BR>
In April 1988, the Los Angeles Conservation Corps was given city funding
to operate a summer-long cleaning and beautification program for 300 junior
high school students. Participants, working as teams, were assigned 24 hours
of work a week over two months and received hourly wages. A strong education
component, developed with the assistance of the Constitutional Rights Foundation
was integrated with the service activities. These included learning about
conservation, documentation skills and self-reflection on what the youth
were doing. (RVB)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Texas ranks among the top 10 states for school dropouts with an
annual dropout rate of about 30%. Some dropout prevention programs are incorporating
community service components as a means to counter the alienation and low
self-esteem frequently seen among dropouts and at-risk students. Significant
adults other than school personnel provide youth with linkages to a community's
heritage and culture. The Youth Exchanging with Seniors Project (YES) is
a pilot project designed to link youth with rural elderly through community-based
service programs in 20 West Texas counties. With few human services available
in this sparsely populated area, innovative grass-roots projects must be
initiated to address the long-term care needs of aging frail elders. The
group of age 60 and over comprises 15-23% of the population in 16 of these
counties. YES proposes to organize members of 4-H and Future Homemakers
of America. The project will provide the elderly with services such as housekeeping,
yard and garden maintenance, minor home repair, grocery shopping, errands,
and pet care. Participation in the project will give youth the opportunities
to develop a better sense of self, meaningful social and community awareness,
and positive attitudes toward the elderly. Project services also will help
the frail elderly to maintain an independent living style. As a result,
the YES project may provide a model for linking at-risk youth with significant
adults through community service. (ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This booklet provides information about the Valued Youth Partnership
(VYP) program for dropout prevention. Begun in 1984 with the support of
the Coca-Cola Company and the collaboration of the Intercultural Development
Research Association, the VYP program is being implemented in the Edgewood
and South San Antonio school districts in San Antonio, Texas. In 1985-86
the program served 100 middle and high school students in those two districts.
The program identifies high risk pupils as valued youth and gives them an
opportunity to make a difference by serving as tutors of younger children.
Both the tutors and their students make gains in school. The booklet describes
the program's history, purpose, and components. It provides detailed information
on program management and organization, participant identification, and
tutor training curriculum. For educators who are considering implementing
a VYP program in their areas, a resource section is appended with a review
of the literature and samples of forms used in the program. Evaluation data
indicate that the program is producing results by keeping students in school
and by improving their self-concept, school citizenship, school attendance,
and achievement. (ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Although at-risk children develop more problems than the general
population, many become healthy, competent young adults. Resilient children
usually possess social competence, problem-solving skills, autonomy, and
a sense of purpose and future. Families, schools, and communities protecting
children from adversity are characterized by caring and support, positive
expectations, and ongoing participation opportunities. A sidebar explains

ABSTRACT: A challenge for the 1990s is the implementation of prevention
strategies that strengthen protective factors in families, schools, and
communities. Protective factors refer to positive action strategies that
build resiliency in youth. After a brief overview of protection factor research,
the major protective factors that contribute to the development of resiliency
in youth and the implications for building effective prevention programs
are discussed. Support, high expectations, and encouragement of youth participation
are family, school, and community protective factors. A conclusion is that
the increasing numbers of students experiencing risk due to economic deprivation
necessitate a systems perspective in prevention strategies. From this perspective,
a major underlying factor of social problems is the gradual destruction
of naturally occurring social networks in the community. Strategies based
on power sharing and reciprocity, such as mentoring and cooperative learning,
are advocated to strengthen these social bonds and to promote the protective
factors of support, high expectations, and participation. School community
linkages and communitywide collaboration are also crucial. (138 references)

ABSTRACT: If schools are to respond effectively to the problems of youth
at risk, they must build &quot;reclaiming&quot; environments that recover
alienated youths by addressing both the students' needs and the needs of
society. In the first of three sections, this document examines the alienation
of children in a frequently inhospitable society. Destructive relationships
at home and at school, the effects of negative environments and expectations,
and the outcomes of naive theories of behavior among educators are discussed
as well as learned irresponsibility, the loss of purpose among youth, and
problems associated with excessive individualism, depersonalization, and
the changing role of work in students' lives. In an exploration of Native
American child-rearing philosophies, the second section examines the spirits
of belonging, mastery, independence, and generosity that are perceived as
values in Native American culture and that nurture four essential components
of self-esteem: significance, competence, power, and virtue. The final section
highlights principles and strategies related to establishing positive relationships
with at-risk youths, implementing alternative methods for organizing learning
experiences, disciplining to counter irresponsibility, and fostering prosocial
values in youth. Each section is followed by corresponding references. (ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This research evaluated the effects of involvement of adolescents
in community service activities on levels of alienation. It was proposed
that alienation could be reduced through the implementation of a model which
utilized community service activities to facilitate adolescent access to
adult society, development of responsibility, collaborative and cooperative
work, and control over planning and outcomes. It is suggested that adolescent
involvement in service activities can produce positive benefits, among which
are reduced levels of alienation, improved school behavior, improved grade
point average, and acceptance by the adult community. These findings also
suggest that females respond more positively to school when allowed to problem-solve
collectively and collaboratively. (Authors)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Students leave school for many reasons. Pregnancy, family circumstances,
economic necessities, substance abuse, lack of academic success, or disciplinary
actions can influence a young person's decision to quit school. There is
no single solution to the dropout crisis. Just as there are a variety of
causes behind a student's decision to drop out of school, a great many different
strategies exist to prevent this event from occurring. In an effort to determine
the most successful approaches within a comprehensive strategy, the National
Dropout Prevention Center conducted an analysis in 1990 of current research
and practices in more than 350 dropout prevention programs. The result is
a synthesis of 12 strategies that have had the most positive impact on the
dropout rate in communities across the nation. These 12 strategies are summarized
in this document, focusing on expected benefits, program ideas to consider,
organizations with additional resources, and additional readings and references.
The strategies are: (1) parental assistance and involvement; (2) quality
early childhood education; (3) concentrated reading and writing programs;
(4) individualized instruction; (5) utilization of instructional technologies;
(6) mentoring and tutoring; (7) workforce readiness and career counseling;
(8) summer enhancement programs; (9) flexible schedules and alternative
programs; (10) staff development programs; (11) school-based management;
and (12) community and business collaboration. (ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: At-risk youth face a number of challenges stemming from poverty,
lack of adequate family support, overexposure to media and drugs. Young
people, however, have or can develop resiliency to and protection against
these threats. To foster healthy youth, Quest International, in a partnership
with the American Association of School Administrators and Lions Clubs International,
developed the Skills for Adolescence program. Skills for Adolescence focuses
on middle and junior high schools because youth at this stage are particularly
vulnerable and impressionable. Skills for Adolescence targets the area of
social development. It aims to meet the needs for a caring school environment,
positive social skills, self-confidence, and the practice of resistance
to negative influences. The service-learning component of Skills for Adolescence
is important for instruction in positive social skills development. This
is also important in establishing a partnership with the community and involving
parents with their children. By 1989, Skills for Adolescence had been adopted
by more than 12,000 schools after five years of existence. (RVB)<BR>
SERVICE-LEARNING CONNECTION: Though service-learning is an essential part
of this program targeting at-risk youth, the other components (parental
involvement, inservice teacher training and emphasis on critical thinking
skills) need to be present to holistically address the needs of the youth
and school.<BR>

ABSTRACT: The effects on selected student outcomes are evaluated after 2
years of operation of Project RAISE, a multifaceted approach to helping
at-risk students featuring outside adults as school-based advocates and
one-on-one mentors at seven middle schools in Baltimore (Maryland). Seven
community sponsoring groups (churches, universities, businesses, and a social
fraternity) each sponsor approximately 60 at-risk youth. Positive effects
are found in improved student attendance and report card grades in English,
but not in promotion rates or standardized test scores. The effects, although
sizable, are not sufficient to neutralize the academic risks with which
students enter the program. The positive results are primarily attributed
to three of the seven sites. Some evidence supports interpretations that
although strong one-on-one mentoring is not an essential component of an
effective program that uses outside adults to assist at-risk middle school
students, the RAISE model is much more likely to show positive results when
one-on-one monitoring is strongly implemented. Success may also depend on
the size and composition of the student group to be served. Issues are raised
about roles and responsibilities of adult advocates or mentors. Three tables
of statistical data and 10 references are included. (ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This bulletin contends that before a school can implement an effective
program for fighting drug abuse it must first examine a series of questions:
What do we mean by &quot;abuse&quot;? What characterizes young people at
risk for this dangerous behavioral pattern? Do we distinguish between drug
&quot;abuse&quot; and drug &quot;use&quot;? Does the &quot;Just Say NO!&quot;
message work? And if it does, are all young people equally affected by it?
It is also important to distinguish between drug experimentation and drug
abuse. A number of risk factors are identified for children that are likely
to predispose them to future drug abuse; these include: family management
problems; early antisocial behavior; academic underachievement; alienation,
rebelliousness, and lack of social bonding to society; antisocial behavior
in early adolescence; friends who use drugs; and early first use of drugs.
There is a consensus among experts that a prevention strategy targeted at
high risk youth should involve a strong balance between family, community,
and school. The message of an effective prevention strategy involves teaching
and reinforcing prosocial values through action. Other effective prevention
strategies involve providing high risk or drug abusing young people with
skill training, alternative activities, therapeutic counseling, and peer
support. An annotated list of seven publications on drug prevention programs
is included. (ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Three instruments were selected to measure concepts viewed as
essential to political socialization necessary for functioning in today's
society. The concepts studied were: (1) a respect for law and order in society
as measured by the Law Scale; (2) a belief in the equality of all individuals
and the constitutional rights of all citizens as measured by the Freedoms
Scale; and (3) an open-mindedness to the opinions of others and receptiveness
to new facts as measured by the Dogmatism Field Scale. The study suggests
that low ability, at-risk students are more dogmatic and consequently less
likely to support fundamental freedoms embodied in the Freedoms Scale and
the Bill of Rights. Social studies educators need to seek ways to increase
support of fundamental freedoms, and to explore strategies to decrease the
dogmatism or close-minded attitudes evident in many low ability and average
adolescents. (ERIC) <BR>

ABSTRACT: Effective schools provide at-risk students with a community of
support that encourages school membership and educational engagement. This
study describes effective dropout prevention programs, develops a generalizable,
theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between at-risk
students and their schools, and suggests local and state policy changes
to improve schools. Data were gathered from site visits to 14 secondary
schools selected on the basis of their successful dropout prevention programs.
Key findings include the following: (1) successful schools created a supportive
environment that helped students overcome impediments to membership and
engagement; (2) impediments to engagement include absence of economic pay-off
after graduation, a narrow conceptualization of learning, and a superficial
curriculum; (3) successful programs matched student needs and problems,
and took advantage of student interests and strengths; and (4) the teachers
at successful schools accept a proactive moral responsibility for educating
at-risk youth. (ERIC)<BR>
<BR>
SERVICE-LEARNING CONNECTION: The service-learning approach closely fits
some of the key findings. This suggests the possibility of service-learning
as a means of dropout prevention. Service-learning programs provide opportunities
for the development of a supportive environment fostering membership and
commitment while engaging students in tangible learning activities. A flexible
service-learning program matches student needs and interests to community
needs and interests.

and career-development programs. While containing experiential elements,
these do not strictly fall within the boundaries of &quot;service-learning&quot;
unless there is a measure of service to the students' community. However,

section describes the research survey that led to the notebook's development
and summarizes some of the recent literature concerning at-risk students
and strategies that appear successful in helping them. Section B lists site
coordinators' reasons why the Career Information System helps high-risk
youth. Fifteen model programs from school districts, high schools, junior
high schools, and agencies, all of which use an integrated approach to using
career information with at-risk youth, are described in section C. Section
D contains practical statements of ideas, programs, and activities from
site coordinators, and section E includes plans for classroom activities
that have been found to be effective with at-risk youth. The final section
is a planning guide that has been designed to help a site coordinator (an
administrator, counselor, teacher, or career aide) use the materials in
this notebook in his or her own particular setting. (ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This interim evaluation compares the initiation, design, and curriculum
of two school-based &quot;academy&quot; programs in Oakland (California)
high schools and examines their links to the school district and the business
community. The academy model of schools-within-a-school originated in Philadelphia.
The Health Academy at Oakland Technical High School prepares students for
postsecondary study in the health professions. The Media Academy at John
C. Fremont High School gives students experience and training in both print
and electronic media. Students at the Health Academy have been identified
as at risk of dropping out but are judged to have the potential to succeed.
Students at the Media Academy are exclusively selected from feeder junior
high schools. The curricula of the academies focus on different academic
areas, but share an emphasis on postsecondary preparation. Business and
community involvement is an important component of both programs, with links
to local institutions of higher learning, public hospitals, newspapers,
and television stations. However, support from the local school district
has been unsystematic. Both academies would benefit from increased involvement
by the school district and the business community, and the directors need
more planning and development time to maintain the schedule of growth that
they envision. A list of four references is appended. (ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Many youth face the following educational and economic barriers
to success: (1) increased high school dropout rates; (2) adolescent pregnancy;
(3) chronic unemployment; (4) poverty; (5) drug abuse; (6) suicide; and
(7) crime and delinquency. The Atlantic Community College (New Jersey) Youth
Corps Program, a successful conservation and service corps program serving
out-of-school youth between the ages of 16 and 25, illustrates the important
link between earning and learning. The program is the newest of 15 New Jersey
Youth Corps programs, developed by the State to combat unemployment and
illiteracy. Participants are exposed to comprehensive educational and vocational
experiences, including significant contact with caring and committed adults.
Project components include the following: (1) Intake; (2) Orientation and
Screening; (3) Breakaway Curriculum; (4) Community Service Projects; (5)
Basic Skills; (6) Supportive Services; (7) Student Council and Alumni Association;
and (8) Graduation and Achievement Awards Ceremony. Among other cited benefits
to students and employers, participants who were tested after competing
100 hours of the program showed a general improvement in grade equivalency
levels ranging from .01 to 2.0. A brief list of references is included.

ABSTRACT: This practicum was designed to assist 62 incoming, at-risk, ninth-grade
students to acquire the knowledge, motivation, interest, and skills necessary
to make a successful transition to high school. Primary objectives were
to reduce the number of disciplinary infractions; decrease school absences;
involve more of the students in school-related activities; and increase
student awareness of study skills, career education services, and counseling
assistance. During the practicum program, groups of eight students met with
school personnel during their lunch period, to promote social interaction
among the students as well as between students and the program's faculty
members. Upper-class volunteers were then assigned as &quot;buddies&quot;
to ninth-graders. The upper-class students were to serve as role models
while assisting the at-risk students with transitional concerns. Group guidance
sessions served as vehicles to define and explore school policies, programs,
services, and regulations. Small group counseling sessions and individual
counseling sessions were introduced to provide an informal setting to share
feelings and explore ideas. Study and examination skills were taught, career
exploration sessions were conducted, tutoring assistance was provided, and
social activities were organized. The practicum involved teachers, students,
counselors, and parents in easing transitional difficulties. Analysis of
data revealed that the program was successful in meeting its objectives.
Appendices provide a student survey form and records of disciplinary infractions,
absences, and school activities involvement. (Contains 27 references.) (ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: The Special Needs Unit of the Career-Vocational Education Division,
California State Department of Education, began sponsoring a secondary school
project in 1985 to combat California's high dropout rate. Eight secondary
school sites in six districts were selected to develop schoolwide, integrated,
career-oriented curriculum that would use the State Model Curriculum Standards
and Frameworks for both academic and vocational subject areas. Technical
assistance, guidance, and inservice workshops were provided by personnel
from the University of California and the State Department of Education.
School philosophies changed, curriculum review occurred in all areas, and
business and industry and other community representatives became more involved
in local education. Each school's main emphasis was to improve career-vocational
education programs for disadvantaged students, although school personnel
accurately anticipated that this would also benefit all students. Project
personnel expected that by improving academic and career preparation, students
would remain in school and thereby attain sufficient skills for higher education,
employment, personal growth, citizenship, and ethical development. These
expectations were met best at the schools that completed most of 42 project
objectives and are evidenced by statistics such as the following from one
school: (1) dropout rates decreased from 16 percent to 11 percent; (2) attendance
rates increased by 1.8 percent; (3) teen pregnancies decreased by 50 percent;
and (4) suspension days decreased by 84 percent. High school came to be
viewed as a preparation for careers either at the completion of high school
or through further education. (ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This paper reviews the literature related to the role of career
and vocational education in retaining at-risk secondary youth and motivating
them to return to secondary or postsecondary school. Selected literature
from nonvocational but related areas of service is reviewed to provide the
reader with an overview of the scope of the problem and the efforts that
other members of the community are making to serve at-risk youth. The paper
identifies five major areas of interest to career and vocational educators
in the literature: (1) the diverse definitions, characteristics, and causes
of at-risk status; (2) the implications of the problem of at-risk youth
for the U.S. labor force; (3) key vocational and nonvocational strategies
for resolving the problems of at-risk youth; (4) exemplary vocational and
nonvocational programs for serving at-risk youth; and (5) the role of career
and vocational educators in meeting the needs of at-risk youth. Forty-two
references are included. (ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: The Effects of Service Activities on Adolescent Alienation.<BR>
JOURNAL CITATION: Adolescence; v21 n83 p675-87 Fall 1986<BR>
ABSTRACT: This research evaluated the effects of involvement of adolescents
in community servie activities on levels of alienation. It was proposed
that alienation could be reduced through the implementation of a model which
utilized community service activities to facilitate adolescent access to
adult society, development of responsibility, collaborative and cooperative
work, and control over planning and outcomes. It is suggested that adolescent
involvement in service activities can produce positive benefits, among which
are reduced levels of alienation, improved school behavior, improved grade
point average, and acceptance by the adult community. These findings also
suggest that females respond more positively to school when allowed to problem-solve
collectively and collaboratively. (Authors)<BR>

<P><HR>Community service and service-learning projects represent a powerful
forum for developing language and communication skills. Connections with
the community reinvigorate language education while enhancing the civic
awareness of students. The sources selected for this topic bibliography
are intended to aid practitioners in thinking about and developing service
activities in their classrooms, schools and communities. The first section
contains references providing background information and conceptual frameworks
useful in thinking broadly about the role of service in the English language
arts. This is followed by items which feature descriptions of service programs
or information pertinent to program development. Records in each section
are listed alphabetically by author. Basic information is given pertaining
to primary author(s), title, year published, and availability. In addition,
abstracts of varying length accompany each citation to give readers an idea
of what's included. 
<H3>Acquiring and Ordering Publications</H3>
<BR>
A goal of this topic bibliography is not only to provide interested practitioners
with a list of citations but to aid in making the actual sources available
in their full form for use. To this end, each record contains availability
information which should enable everyone to locate and use the item. <BR>
<BR>
In general, the easiest and least expensive way to have access to the publications
is through your local library. Even if you are not near a university research
library, most smaller libraries have interlibrary loan (ILL) agreements
at no or little cost to their patrons. The alternative to libraries is to
go through commercial document reproduction and delivery services. These
offer a convenient way to get copies of serial articles and other documents
for those willing to pay for the service. The different forms of publications
mean there are variations in how to get a copy to use. 
<H4>ERIC Documents</H4>
The U.S. Department of Education's Educational Resources Information Center
(ERIC) collects resources in education which might not normally be widely
disseminated. The ERIC Document Reproduction Service (EDRS) provides both
microfiche and paper copy reproductions of these documents. To order you
will need the ERIC Document number (ED) which can be found in the &quot;AVAIL.&quot;
field of those documents reproduced by EDRS. See the attached copy of their
order form for further ordering and pricing information. The number following
the &quot;PC&quot; indicates the paper copy price of the document. Further

<H4>Serial and Journal Articles</H4>
For the journal and serial articles listed in this topic bibliography, full
source citations are provided in the &quot;AVAIL.&quot; field. This information
is sufficient for use in finding the article at your library or in requesting
it through interlibrary loan. In addition, numerous private commercial article

ABSTRACT: Civic education &quot;means explicit and continuing study of the
basic concepts and values underlying our democratic political community
and constitutional order&quot; (Butts 1988, 184). It draws its content chiefly
from four disciplines: political science, jurisprudence, history, and economics.
Political science and jurisprudence provide an understanding of ideas, institutions,
and procedures about law and government that protect individual rights and
promote a government based on law, majority rule with minority rights, and
the public good. The study of history gives us knowledge of our country's
past, who we are as a people, and our successes and failures in realizing
our country's political and legal ideals. And economics offers knowledge
about how to use scarce resources to satisfy human needs and wants within
a constitutional government based on the values of democracy and individual
rights. However, language education, too, makes an important contribution
to civic education. (Author)<BR>

NOTES: 223 pages.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Evidence suggests that programs in language education are not
preparing students adequately for their roles as citizens. This collection
of essays has two major purposes. The first is to indicate some of the challenges
that secondary and college-level teachers now face in developing in young
Americans the moral framework for public discourse and public behavior in
this country. The second purpose is to suggest how these teachers might
best address these challenges in the context of their regular academic programs.
Each chapter focuses on the social, theoretical, pedagogical, and research
issues in a particular area of the English language arts, and then suggests
how a civic ethic can be enhanced in that area. The following chapters make
up the content of the book: &quot;The Decline of a Civic Ethic&quot; (Sandra
Stotsky); &quot;Reading and Civic Literacy: Are We Literate Enough to Meet
Our Civic Responsibilities?&quot; (Jeanne S. Chall and Dorothy Henry); &quot;Teaching
Contemporary American Literature: A Professional Dilemma&quot; (Sandra Stotsky
with Hardy Beierl); &quot;An Annotated Reading List for High School and
College Teachers: Reclaiming Our Humanity in Twentieth-Century Literature&quot;
(John W. Cameron); &quot;On Developing Independent Thinking and Responsible
Writing: What We Can Learn from Studies of the Research Process&quot; (Sandra
Stotsky); &quot;Teaching Academic Writing as Moral and Civic Thinking&quot;
(Sandra Stotsky); &quot;Language Education and Civic Education: Recovering
Past Traditions, Reassessing Contemporary Challenges: (Lisa Ede); &quot;The
Uses of Argument in Civic Education: A Philosophy and Practices for Our

ABSTRACT: Assuming that writing and reading must serve the goals of a liberal
education (preparing young Americans for responsibl citizenship), the Institute
on Writing, Reading, and Civic Education promotes student writing to personalize
civic relationships, to obtain or provide information or services, to evaluate
public services, or to evaluate a position on a public issue. (ERIC--EJ

ABSTRACT: Describes college &quot;Writing as Social Reflection&quot; advanced
expository writing class. Students read fiction and nonfiction related to
contemporary social problems and perform a minimum of twenty hours of community
service. Students use formal papers, class discussions and journal writing
to reflection on the themes of : &quot;How do we move from intellectual
analysis of moral and ethical social issues to a socially responsible life
and, in addition to volunteering our time, what other concrete forms of
social action are possible for us as individuals?&quot; Excerpts from student
journals demonstrate the kinds of learning which takes place in the course.

AVAIL.: Boynton / Cook Publishers, Heinemann Educational Books, Inc., 70
Court Street, Portsmouth, NH 03801.<BR>
NOTES: 186 pages.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This book takes the view that when students use language arts
for the genuine purpose of interacting with their communities, they not
only learn and strengthen those abilities but strengthen their identities
as members of a larger society. Community study is the method offered for
integrating the classroom and community. The approach outlined consists
of five phases beginning with students discovering their attitudes toward
the specific subject they are about to study. In the second phase, students
examine where these attitudes come from. Phase three involves students in
research, both in and out of the classroom. More specific aspects of the
subject are explored in phase four when students investigate situations
that are less than ideal or uncover problems that are not yet solved. Following
this deep investigation of community topics, the publication of the student's
work or some other type of sharing with their wider community takes place
in phase five. The purpose of publishing is to preserve and extend the knowledge
developed by students over the course of the project. Most of the book is
a collection of language arts-based activities designed for K-12 teachers
illustrated by examples of intergenerational connections. Additional resources
include lists of children's books and young adult fiction / nonfiction with
themes of old age and/or significant older characters as well as sources
of information on aging and aging education. (NICSL)<BR>

TITLE: Teaching Civic Identity and Civic Writing in the Information Age.<BR>
YEAR: 1990 <BR>
AVAIL.: EDRS: ED 348340 / PC01.<BR>
NOTES: 14p.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Given the increasingly multi-ethnic school population and the
lack of democratic political traditions in many students' cultural backgrounds,
new ways to educate for citizenship are essential. The paper recommends
developing multidisciplinary approaches to teaching civic identity and civic
writing. It describes how a New Jersey school district introduced civic
writing activities directly linked to local history and community issues,
combining public and individual experiences with high school student commitment.
The planning team agreed that the English, social studies, and science departments
would work cooperatively to assess student research writing. They considered:
topics that would address ways to build a sense of community within the
student body; ways to develop participatory and responsible civic behavior;
and methods of teaching skills, values, and attitudes to prepare students
for the future. The multidisciplinary themes they chose were environmental
issues, local history, and multicultural studies and global issues. Besides
completing question-driven research projects, students were encouraged to
participate in local community service projects. The article offers nine
recommendations to help transform the current research process that relies
on thesis writing into a viable question-driven design. It suggests that
combining academic discourse with community service provides the social
and political glue to enhance students' personal development with civic
responsibility. (ERIC--ED 348340)<BR>

NOTES: 17p. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the College English
Association (23rd, Pittsburgh, PA, March 27-29, 1992).<BR>
ABSTRACT: A writing course (adapted from Eliot Wigginton's &quot;Foxfire&quot;
method) for college freshmen and sophomores is taught in a way that is not
only important to the students concerned but to their community--a valley
in the &quot;rust belt&quot; of Pennsylvania-- as a whole. The course differs
from the usual writing-in-the- social-sciences course in three ways: (1)
students work with three historical topics that are closely tied to their
locale; (2) the students use primary materials (diaries, letters, scrapbooks,
quilts, original maps and drawings); and (3) the students view themselves
as professional writer-editors and act accordingly. The course is taught
each fall with editing in the spring and publication in the summer of an
annual softcover compilation. Early in the course, students are taught how
to conduct interviews. Classes deal with group editing of students' articles
and grammar review. A few classes are devoted to viewing a series of films,
followed by discussion. After the semester is over, articles to be published
are selected by the instructor with the help of volunteer student editors.
The course is successful--the community feels good about preserving local
history, the students begin to value their community, and families are sometimes
brought together as they share memories and family history. (A flyer describing
the course, the syllabus, a student questionnaire, and a publication release
form are attached.) (ED 350620)<BR>

ABSTRACT: The objective of this one-year program is to help students develop
competencies to exert influence in public affairs. Seven competencies, such
as communication and social skills, are considered fundamental to an education
in citizenship and civic responsibility. The program could be initiated
at either the 11th or 12th grade, and includes the disciplines of English
and social studies. Team-teaching is suggested. The six components of the
program are: (1) a political-legal process course; (2) a communications
course; (3) community service internship; (4) a citizen action project;
(5) an action in literature course; (6) and a public message course. Field
work, a vital part of the program, includes working for political candidates
and for community organizations. Detailed explanations of the six components,
evaluation methods, and techniques for winning community support are outlined
in separate chapters. Addresses of publishers and distributors of relevant
materials are listed in the appendix. (ERIC--ED 142448)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This paper describes two activities used in a course that implemented
the &quot;Foxfire&quot; approach for studying the local community of Rock
Hill, South Carolina. The first activity, a unit on the family, encouraged
discussion of students' families, presented poems exploring the details
of family experience, and provided the opportunity for students to compose
character sketches and poems. The second activity, based on students' interviews
of old people at the local senior citizens' center, resulted in written
compositions about the experience. Examples of students' poems and their
written interviews with senior citizens are included. (ERIC--ED 145418)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Writing for the community emphasizes literacy, action research,
and &quot;real world&quot; writing and publishing. Writing for the community
projects involve students in the experience of preparing informative, clear
writing for real readers who need the information. This requires them to
work together and with outsiders, make and stick to schedules, meet deadlines,
and produce something of value to themselves and their community. Following
introductory and background information, a substantial portion of the guide
gives examples of reports and proposals from a variety of writing for the
community projects. A final section contains materials useful in guiding
the writing process and using word processing programs. (NICSL)<BR>

TITLE: Guidelines for Planning and Implementing a Comprehensive Community
Environmental Inventory. Revised, 1972.<BR>
ABSTRACT: A comprehensive community environmental inventory is an ongoing
process of investigation and study to compile and evaluate information about
the natural and man-made environmental features and characteristics of an
area, as well as related social, political, and economic information. Such
information is important to the community in developmental planning and
in preventing and resolving environmental problems and it is important in
serving as a local basis for an environmental education emphasis in the
school. Section I includes a general overview of the uses and procedures
involved in a community environmental inventory. Section II outlines the
importance of natural environmental features and characteristics as a basis
for the assessment of natural areas and their importance to one another.
Section III identifies human environmental use areas and characteristics.
Section IV provides guidelines and information for evaluating the natural
ecological effects of human environmental use and the degree to which these
areas meet human needs; and guidelines for identifying, interpreting, and
evaluating ecological values of land, air, water, plants, and animals. The
related social, political, and economic aspects of the community are considered
in Section V. Section VI provides sources for inventory information. (TK--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Outdoor Biology Instructional Strategies (OBIS): 1972-79. Final Project
Report.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Prepared for the National Science Foundation (NSF), this report
summarizes the development and work of the Outdoor Biology Instructional
Strategies (OBIS) project from 1972 to 1979. One hundred activities for
ten- to fifteen-year-olds in community groups (scouts, clubs, camps, churches,
etc.) were developed, field tested, revised, and made available to the public.
The intent of the materials was to increase the environmental awareness,
knowledge, and management skills of future decision makers by teaching about
major biological concepts and ecological interactions in an informal educational
setting. Special characteristics of the program include a national scope
within regional and local diversity, flexible use patterns, &quot;leaderproof&quot;
activities, multidisciplinary approach, and grassroots involvement. This

TITLE: Environmental Education and Your School Site.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This handbook, designed primarily for use in the development of
existing elementary school sites, has the overall objective of defining
a process approach to the development of a school site for use in environmental
education. This approach involves the student body, school personnel, and
the community in the planning, development and use of the school site as
a green island for school and community use. Specific objectives of the
handbook are: (1) to establish a rationale for developing school sites for
use in environmental education: ecological, instructional, economic, and
community benefits; (2) to provide guidelines for organizing a school site
development effort; (3) to point out pitfalls one may encounter in site
development efforts; (4) to provide strategies, ideas, and techniques for
teachers to use in order to draw the most instructional benefit from the
development and use of the school site; (5) to point out ways to achieve
the maximum number of spin-off benefits from the development of the site;
and (6) to provide selected references to written materials and available
institutional and human resources. This handbook is written with the belief
that one motivated individual can rally the school and community interest
and support necessary to cooperatively develop a school site. (Author/BT--ERIC)<BR>

<HR>TITLE: Actividades al Aire Libre (Outdoor Activities). OBIS/Mini-Corps.<BR>
ABSTRACT: The all-Spanish version of the Outdoor Biology Instructional Strategies
(OBIS)/Mini-Corps Outdoor Activities set contains twenty education and recreational
activities which provide a variety of outdoor biological experiences and
incorporate language skills into outdoor education. Prepared especially
for use by migrant children aged 10-15 in a summer camp environment, the
activities employ educational games, experimentation, observation, and simulation
in the study of plant and animal organisms on land and in the water. Each
activity is presented in an individual water-resistant folio, complete with
introduction, materials list, preparation, action, and language development
section. Presented in three parts (discussion, games, vocabulary) the language
section is designed to take advantage of the language possibilities that
arise naturally from each activity. The package contains three additional
folios which explain fundamental OBIS activity concepts, describe how to
use the materials and activities, and give directions for the construction
of simple equipment such as dip nets and aquatic observation chambers. A
bilingual version of the same package is also available. (SB--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Science Talk: Science in the ESL Classroom.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This paper describes an approach to using science activities as
a means to teach English in the English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) classroom.
It is based on the author's work in Preparing Refugees for Elementary Programs
(PREP) at the Philippine Refugee Processing Center. Refugee children from
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, ages 6 to 12, attend class for 4 hours a day
during the 18-week PREP instructional cycle. The paper first introduces
the philosophy and daily schedule of PREP. It then presents the theoretical
background for PREP's approach to teaching science and English to refugee
children. The next chapter, titled &quot;Activities,&quot; describes the
station activities in the PREP science room, specifying materials, procedures,
and language used. Chapter 4, &quot;Process,&quot; narrates a sample &quot;discovery
science&quot; lesson presented to a whole class and analyzes the principles
underlying the presentation. The final chapter, &quot;Conclusion,&quot;
discusses the relevance of this approach to mainstream and ESL classrooms
in the United States. A list of English language units is appended. (KR--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: After Three Years: A Status Report on the International High School
at LaGuardia Community College.<BR>
ABSTRACT: In 1985, the International High School (IHS) at LaGuardia Community
College (LCC) in New York City was established to address the crisis in
retention of high school aged immigrants with low English proficiency. IHS
has had great success in improving student attendance, retention, academic
achievement, and graduation. Because of its location on the LCC campus,
students have access to all college facilities and are surrounded by positive
role models. Special features of IHS are: (1) faculty members use English
as a Second Language techniques to reinforce English language development
in all classes; (2) extended day study opportunities are provided; (3) all
graduates are guaranteed admission to LCC; (4) an Integrated Learning Center
provides individualized and small group experiential learning opportunities;
and (5) all students participate in a mandatory out-of-school internship
program. Students must complete the same requirements for graduation as
all other New York State students. All full-time faculty are licensed and
certified Board of Education personnel, empowered to recruit and interview
new applicants for faculty positions, and to participate in curriculum development
and peer review and evaluation. IHS has received several awards for its
success, and provides a positive model for all college-high school collaboration
efforts. (AJL--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Integrating Oral History into the Bilingual Social Studies: An Instructional
Technique That Is Successful.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Oral history is but one of several methods of examining history,
yet it holds powerful implications as a tool of instruction within the bilingual
classroom. The most compelling rationale for integrating oral history techniques
into bilingual social studies is that generally oral history has remained
virtually isolated from most bilingual elementary classrooms. It is an exciting
teaching strategy which can develop a variety of skills and competencies
in learners and is a refreshing approach not only to bilingual social studies,
but also to language arts and other subject areas. Socialization is enhanced
as students and teachers work jointly and as students go out into their
various communities and become involved in the interview process. Interaction
with interviewees and consequent listening, editing, and transcription expose
students to different terminology, dialects, etc. After bilingual teachers
become familiar with oral history techniques, they can conduct interviews
with local citizens and take two or three students along so that all are
involved in the learning process. Students can interview different family
members and gear their interviews toward various themes such as immigration,
religious attitudes, musicology, etc. Oral history projects should conclude
with a planned finale--a little publication of excerpts, an exhibit, or
an honoring of narrators. (BRR--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Educare: Evaluation of a Transition Program for Culturally Disadvantaged
and Educationally Handicapped Youth. Final Performance Report, 9/1/85 to
10/31/87.<BR>
ABSTRACT: The Transition Instructional Program was designed to provide transition
services to a culturally insulated group of dropout, migrant, bilingual
youth of ethnic minority origin, a significant number of whom were adjudicated,
handicapped, or limited English speaking. The project utilized experiential
instructional techniques to promote the subjects' integration into &quot;mainstream&quot;
culture by enhancing educational, personal, social, and economic measures
of health. The students received training in General Education Development
(GED) preparation along with training in four other program components:
Foxfire, Rural Employability Development for Youth, Computer Practicum,
and Peer-Mentorship.) Subjects were administered outcome measures of personal
health (self-esteem, emotional integration, interpersonal competence, identity,
and independence), measures of social health (social integration, sharing
of norms with the larger social order, and personal competence), and measures
of socioeconomic health (occupation or employment preparation and job relevant
skills). Compared to controls who received GED preparation only, subjects
showed improvement on all measures. Appendices, which make up approximately
half the report, contain descriptions of the program components, descriptions
of the scales used, a sample of the survey instrument, and various tables.

TITLE: A Problem-Solving Model for Integrating Science and Language in Bilingual/Bicultural
Education. Bilingual Education Paper Series, Vol. 5, No. 1.<BR>
ABSTRACT: An integrated bilingual science instruction model is described.
Intended primarily for Spanish-speaking children in the Southwest, it specifies
how the dominant language skills and the second language might be synchronized
and be mutually supportive with science learning in a way relevant to the
Latino culture. For purposes of discussion and clarification, the integrative
model is contrasted with three hypothetical models: the transfer, the balanced
bilingual, and the ESL models. It is argued that a problem-solving approach
to science instruction with the proper hands-on activities could improve
the bilingual/bicultural program by: (1) focusing more on cognitive operations
of science; (2) involving the children in actual problem-solving thought
processes; and (3) improving skills in both languages. More specifically,
the model spells out how skills in both languages can be used in a basically
immersion approach, that is, an approach which uses science-oriented materials
to teach the second language. Further, the model is directed toward teaching
both English and Spanish as second languages through science instruction.
Because there is a lack of bilingual science materials appropriate for Southwest
Spanish speakers, it is suggested that teachers develop materials from hands-on
materials written in English for teacher use. Suggestions are made for this
procedure as well as for creation of materials by the teacher. (Author/AMH--ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This executive summary describes an evaluation study of a program
which provided transition services to a culturally insulated group of dropout,
migrant, bilingual youth of ethnic minority origin, a significant number
of whom were adjudicated, handicapped, or limited English speaking. The
project utilized experiential instructional techniques to promote the subjects'
integration into &quot;mainstream&quot; culture by enhancing educational,
personal, social, and economic measures of health. The students received
training in General Education Development (GED) preparation along with training
in four other program components: Foxfire, Rural Employability Development
for Youth, Computer Practicum, and Peer-Mentorship. When transition program
participants were administered measures of personal, social, economic, and
educational &quot;health,&quot; they were found to have significantly benefited
from the transition model, compared with those receiving only standard GED
instruction. The executive summary briefly reviews the study background,
the research problem, research subjects and setting, methodology, findings,

Title VII Final Evaluation Report, 1980-1981.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This report describes and evaluates Project At Your Service, a
basic bilingual secondary education program with a vocational focus for
Spanish speaking students and students from other minority language groups.
As implemented in 1980-81, the program aimed to enhance the acquisition
of the English language and to promote academic achievement among students
of limited English proficiency through instruction in English as a Second
Language, English reading, the native language, mathematics, social studies,
science, and vocational courses. The program also provided for curriculum
and materials development, counseling services, staff training, and parent
involvement. In general, program participants showed favorable attitudes
to the program. Evaluation indicated that the program achieved its objectives
for reading in English. Data on achievement in the content areas were not

ABSTRACT: A bilingual vocational training program was instituted to provide
fifty-six Spanish- and Chinese-speaking students with a chance to acquire
English language skills and training as medical clerks simultaneously. Community
benefits expected and evident need in the area for bilingual medical-clerical
employees led to the choice of this field. The twelve-month, four-quarter
program had courses concentrated in skill development (office skills and
medical office procedures) and English proficiency (language training and
medical terminology). On-the-job experience came from work in local offices
and clinics, the time ratio of classwork to fieldwork being 3:1. Sixteen
courses were developed along with support services that included bilingual
counseling and a learning center with bilingual instructors. The bilingual
staff availed themselves of an extensive and individualized development
program consisting of workshops and inservice training. The program was
judged successful based on (1) overall positive student and staff response;
(2) on-the-job training completion by 70% of students; (3) very high student
achievement since twenty-two of the thirty-eight program completers received
full-time employment (resulting in 183% increase in median income), while
ten students decided to continue studying; and (4) staff gains in skills
and experience resulting from program participation and inservice training.
(Course descriptions, exercises, and a student questionnaire are appended.)

TITLE: The Yugtarvik Museum Project: Using Interactive Multimedia for Cross-Cultural
Distance Education.<BR>
JOURNAL CITATION: Academic-Computing; p6-9,42-44 Apr 1990<BR>
ABSTRACT: Teachers and students at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks developed
an interactive Macintosh-videodisc program that features the exhibits of
the Yugtarvik Yup'ik Eskimo Museum in Bethel, Alaska. The exhibits teach
people about many aspects of traditional Alaska Native culture. The videodisc
program carries both Yup'ik and English audiotracks, making it useful for
bilingual audiences. Apple's HyperCard program allows users to develop stacks
of index cards on a computer screen that can be manipulated and programmed
in many creative ways with a minimal amount of technical knowledge. It also
can be interfaced with interactive multimedia such as videodiscs. Funding
for the project was difficult to obtain because of lack of university support.
Eventually a company that was developing a commercial videodisc for tourists
offered unused time on their videodisc. University students who were enrolled
in a course on using computers in schools developed HyperCard stacks based
on the Bethel Yugtarvik Museum's displays and added animation using VideoWorks
II and Studio 1 software. A media specialist videotaped exhibits at the
museum, and the edited version was converted to a videodisc. The Hypercard
stacks and the videodisc were connected using a Mac Plus computer and a
Pioneer 4200 videodisc player. The Yup'ik computer applications are prepared
for placement in rural Alaska villages to augment college distance education
courses throughout the state. (KS--ERIC)<BR>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
Many claims have been made about the impact of service-learning on participants,
programs and communities. From positive influences on psychological, social,
and intellectual development, to effects on alienation, attitudes and social
behavior, service-learning has been mentioned as a method of achieving these
outcomes. Additional reviews of the literature in areas related to civic
participation and general engagement in the public, political process indicate
that service-learning can have a substantial impact on the civic development
of youth.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, some studies have indicated service-learning does not
always have the desirable positive outcomes expected. As Dan Conrad points
out in his review of service-learning research related to social studies
education and citizenship education, research is still inconclusive as to
the impact of service-learning on participants and on the community.<BR>
<BR>
There is a body of research, dating back to the 1930s, which indicates that
learning in the community has value for students. From the Eight Year Project,
conducted by Ralph Tyler, to the more recent career education movement of
the 1970s, studies show students can benefit academically, personally, and
socially from learning experiences in the community. Whether for the purposes
of career development, performing service, or application of vocational
skills and academic principles, community-based learning produces measurable
results.<BR>
<BR>
What follows in this bibliography is a selection of research and reports
which address the issue of service as an instructional strategy. Several
dissertations and studies completed in the past few years add new information
to support the contention that service-learning does benefit students, as
well as the community. Further studies will help determine whether the impact
of such programs and strategies support increased investment in this promising
educational enterprise. 
<H3>The Organization of this Topic Bibliography </H3>
The citations are divided among five sections. Section One contains those
which focus on the social and psychological outcomes of participation in
service. The impact of service on relationships with others, self esteem
and moral reasoning are common factors under consideration by these authors.
The effect of service on academic achievement, intellectual development
and school behavior is the concentration of research in Section Two. Though
fewer in number, the research reported in this section may be of greater
importance in establishing service-learning as a credible educational practice.
Much research considers both the psycho social and academic impacts of service.
Section Three lists these sources. The few existing reviews and bibliographies
of the research literature are listed in Section Four. Section Five contains
several examples of service program evaluations. <BR>
<BR>
Literature pertaining to both K-12 and post-secondary populations is included
throughout this publication. Although the National Information Center for
Service-Learning and the National Service-Learning Cooperative exist to
assist K-12 service-learning activities, limiting this topic bibliography
to sources on K-12 level service would exclude research useful to all age
levels of service. <BR>
<BR>
Additionally, the varying terminology used to describe service and its many
forms makes it impossible to only include sources which deal explicitly
with &quot;service-learning.&quot; Therefore, the terms &quot;community
service,&quot; &quot;community based learning,&quot; &quot;service learning,&quot;
&quot;youth service,&quot; &quot;volunteerism,&quot; &quot;youth service,&quot;
etc., have been treated as synonymous for the purpose of selecting research
which in some way relates to a discussion of the impacts and effect of service.<BR>
<BR>
Records in each section are listed alphabetically by author. Basic information
is given pertaining to primary author(s), title, year published, and availability.
In addition, abstracts of varying length accompany each citation to give
readers an idea of what's included. Though considerably longer than the
others, the abstracts for dissertations have not been shortened in the interest
of allowing readers as much information about these sometimes hard to find,
or at least use, sources. 
<H3>Acquiring and Ordering Publications</H3>
A goal of this topic bibliography is not only to provide interested researchers
and practitioners with a list of citations but to aid in making the actual
sources available in their full form for use. To this end, each record contains
availability information which should enable everyone to locate and use
the item. <BR>
<BR>
In general, the easiest and least expensive way to have access to the publications
is through your local library. Even if you are not near a university research
library, most smaller libraries have interlibrary loan (ILL) agreements
at little or no cost to their patrons. The alternative to libraries is to
go through commercial document reproduction and delivery services. These
offer a convenient way to get copies of serial articles and other documents
for those willing to pay for the service. The different forms of publications
mean there are variations in how to get a copy for use. <BR>

TITLE: Commitments to Help by Children: Effects on Subsequent Prosocial
Self-Attributions.<BR>
YEAR: 1987<BR>
AVAIL.: British Journal of Social Psychology v26 n3 p237-245 Sep. 1987<BR>
ABSTRACT: A total of 229 children of both sexes from Grades 1, 3, 6, 7,
and 8 were or were not induced to make a commitment to help hospitalized
children by sorting papers. Commitments occurred under public or private
circumstances. Later, Ss discovered that the commitment to help would require
that they give up their recess time. The willingness of Ss to live up to
their commitments and the resultant altruistic self-attributions were measured.
It was found that virtually all Ss were willing to give up recess time to
help. However, self-attributions differed systematically with condition:
Only after making a private commitment did Ss see themselves as more altruistically
oriented. This effect appeared earlier for girls and persisted at least
1 mo. No such effects occurred for public commitments. (PsycINFO Database

TITLE: The Community Involvement Program: Social Service as a Factor in
Adolescent Moral and Psychological Development<BR>
YEAR: 1977 <BR>
AVAIL.: UMI dissertation reproductions<BR>
NOTES: Ed.D. Dissertation, University of Toronto<BR>
ABSTRACT: The Community Involvement Program is a one-year high school program
the aim of which is to lead students to a commitment to the solution of
social problems by a combination of direct experience in social service
and a classroom component in which to reflect critically on their experience.
This thesis studies the effects of participation in the program on the moral
and psycho social development of adolescents.<BR>
<BR>
The first chapter argues for social reform as an aim for education and describes
one proposal for accomplishing that aim, the proposal out of which the Community
Involvement Program emerged. Some of the underlying theoretical assumptions
of the program in the area of social, developmental, and educational theory
are explicated.<BR>
<BR>
Chapter Two argues that our current conceptions of adolescence, with its
enforced isolation from the world of adults and from the social problems
of that world, is psychologically crippling and socially wasteful and must
be changed. The most productive direction for change is to involve the young
in social service. The bulk of the chapter is a comprehensive review of
the research on previous programs which have followed this direction. The
chapter concludes with two hypotheses concerning the effects of the program
on the psycho social development of the young.<BR>
<BR>
The nature of commitment as an educational goal is analyzed in Chapter Three.
As well, there is a consideration of what social service agencies might
be able to contribute to such commitment and of the dangers in placing the
young in such institutions. The chapter concludes with research hypotheses
in the area of commitment and moral development based on the previous analysis.<BR>
<BR>
Chapter Four describes in detail the two years of the Community Involvement
Program, both the work experience and in-school components, which are the
treatment in this study. It is particularly stressed that the nature and
aims of the in-school component changed from a teacher-directed concern
with commitment to the solution of social problems to a student-centered
concern for self-directed personal growth through reflection on experience.<BR>
<BR>
Chapter Five describes the research design used in each year. Since commitment
had been conceived as a way of life based on a moral choice, a configuration
of test measures was used to try to tap the moral underpinnings of commitment.
In the second year of research the interest shifted from an attempt to measure
commitment to a concern with psycho social development, so a new test measure
was selected. In each year the research was based on a pre-test / post-test
design using a comparison group.<BR>
<BR>
The findings are reported in Chapter Six. The results from the first year
show mostly small, non significant changes. However, certain patterns emerge:
the Community Involvement students become more positive about human nature,
show slight increases in level of moral reasoning, and shift from valuing
independence to valuing team membership. In the second year the Community
Involvement students showed large and significant gains on the personality
measure, especially in the areas of Emotional and Task Competence. It was
also found that previous volunteer experience has a positive influence on
what the student gained from the program. Furthermore, those students whose
work involved service to individuals rather than group leadership were influenced
more in the direction of commitment to the solution of social problems.
Two sets of case studies of individual students close the chapter.<BR>
<BR>
The final chapter provides a brief overview of the thesis, drawing together
the major findings and providing suggestions for further research. (Author)<BR>

TITLE: The Effects of Required Community Service on the Development of Self-Esteem,
Personal and Social Responsibility of High School Students in a Friends
School. <BR>
YEAR: 1989<BR>
AVAIL.: UMI dissertation reproductions: Order No: 8926397<BR>
NOTES: 209 pages, D.Min. dissertation, Lancaster Theological Seminary. <BR>
ABSTRACT: The question addressed in this paper is as follows: Is required
community service an effective way to enhance self-esteem, social and personal
responsibility in students in a Friends' secondary school?<BR>
<BR>
Self esteem was high in the group of students studied at the beginning and
end of the study. Social and personal responsibility were enhanced over
the course of the study. Three areas in particular-supervision, intensity
and types of reflection-showed a significant increase. They were a sense
of competence, a sense of efficacy and especially for young women, a sense
of social welfare.<BR>
<BR>
Three levels of intensity were examined: year-long projects meeting weekly,
two to three week intensive experiences and projects that had an intensive
period combined with several other requirements that were spread throughout
the school year. The intense experience gave opportunities for greater responsibility,
a characteristic that was important in students positive response to the
experience.<BR>
<BR>
Three types of supervision were explored: faculty leadership, supervision
by other than school personnel and a combination of both. For students who
were ready for the demands of the independence, an individual project was
of particular value. Students who were not ready to seek their won project
needed the organization of the pre-designed project.<BR>
<BR>
Students who participated in faculty led experiences or with no faculty
supervision were more satisfied with the level of direction and supervision
than those with a combination of supervision.<BR>
<BR>
Required reflection helped students integrate the community service experience
and learning into their won world view. This was especially true when both
written reflection and group discussion was required.<BR>
<BR>
All but one student in the study rated the experience as good or excellent.<BR>
<BR>
Required community service did not bring about as great an improvement as
students in other studies who were not required to complete a community
service requirement.<BR>
<BR>
Certain characteristics made the projects a positive experience for the
student. They included: a point of contact or identification for the student,
a place to begin to relate to the community service experience; opportunities
to develop relationships with the clients; opportunities to have a sense
of adult responsibilities; and clear direction. (Author)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This exploratory study attempts to answer the question: can a
required service-learning experience of limited intensity and duration have
an impact on the development of college students as participating citizens
of their community? Students who provided community service as part of a
one credit &quot;community service laboratory&quot; showed a significant
increase in their belief that people can make a difference, that they should
be involved in community service and particularly in leadership and political
influence, and in their commitment to perform volunteer service the following
semester. They also became less likely to blame social service clients for
their misfortunes and more likely to stress a need for equal opportunity.
They indicated that their experience had led them to more positive perceptions
of the people they worked with. (Author)<BR>

ABSTRACT: What is the experience of early adolescents who participate in
community service? This dissertation, an example of teacher research, closely
examines the experience of four participants in the Community School Service
Program at Central Park East Secondary School, a public school located in
Manhattan.<BR>
<BR>
Many studies of community service measure the emotional, psychological,
and sociological impact of community service on adolescents. Instead of
making assumptions about what the experience of community service might
be like for young people, this study provides an opportunity for students
to give voice to their own experiences. The data for the study, a participant-observation
study, were collected by observing and interviewing four students in the
Community School Service Program during the 1988-1989 school year.<BR>
<BR>
From these students' discussions, descriptions, and actions, five major
themes emerged about their experiences. These were: (1) community service
frequently made the students feel good about themselves; (2) community service
introduced the students to the world outside their regular school and family
life; (3) community service placed these adolescents in situations where
they were responsible to others and where others counted on them; (4) in
their work settings, the students met many new people and they learned about
the many ways people live and view the world; and (5) community service
frequently provided the students with opportunities to be successful. Although
the students did not discuss their experiences in terms of meeting the needs
of adolescent development, what they did present matched the claims of many
researchers concerning the needs of early adolescents.<BR>
<BR>
This study also examines the school's structural features that support the
service program. Some recommendations and suggestions were made to enrich
the student's experience as much as possible. These were: (1) providing
more opportunities for the students to discuss their service experiences,
(2) integrating community service into the classroom curriculum, and (3)
developing a more intensive program for one year, instead of spread out
over four years, that is closely linked to class lessons. (Author)<BR>

NOTES: 22 pages. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational

ABSTRACT: A study explored the effects of participation in two kinds of
volunteer activities - community service and child care - on adolescents'
attitudes toward social and personal responsibility skill development and
knowledge acquisition. It was part of an evaluation of the New York State
4-H Youth Volunteers Program. Written questionnaires, interviews with 73
participants, and testimony from 11 adult supervisors were used to document
such effects. Results showed that girls and community service project participants
gained more positive attitudes than did boys or child care volunteers. Ninety
percent of the participants indicated the likelihood of continued volunteer
work; nearly all volunteers reported gains in skills and knowledge. Adults
involved in the program saw adolescents becoming more confident of their
abilities, learning to make decisions and work with children, and gaining
in other ways that varied according to participants' individual needs and
experiences. (ERIC -- ED 282086)<BR>

ABSTRACT: The Social and Personal Responsibility Scale was employed in a
study of the Youth Volunteers program, involving 44 adolescents in 12 projects,
equally divided between child care and community service. Participants showed
statistically significant gains on the Social Responsibility sub scale.
Girls gained more than boys and volunteers in community improvement projects
gained more than those in child care. However, as in previous studies, gains
were quite modest. Testimony from adolescents and adult participants was
more strongly positive, volunteers citing improvement in their knowledge
of themselves and others and the acquisition of new skills, adults seeing
greater willingness to make decisions. Child care volunteers and their adult
supervisors said they gained competence in working with young children.
The generalized impact of volunteer experiences on enduring attitudes appears
to be positive but small. Future studies should attend as well to differences
in the nature of the experiences adolescent volunteers have and to effects
that vary among participants. (Authors)<BR>

TITLE: Select Changes in High School Students' Self-Esteem and Attitudes
Toward Their School and Community By Their Participation in Service Learning
Activities at a Rocky Mountain High School<BR>

ABSTRACT: Recent studies on the status of American education have called
for more opportunities for students to do service as a part of their school
curriculum. Previous investigators have discussed the difficulty of measuring
changes in student behavior as a result of their involvement in service
learning programs. Although research findings are mixed, a number of studies
found that deliberate interventions helped to raise moral reasoning and
self-concept levels.<BR>
<BR>
The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of the possible impact
a school-sponsored service program had on a group of high school students
enrolled in one of four service programs for 15 weeks during the fall semester
of 1990.<BR>
<BR>
A pretest composed of semantic differential scales, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem
Scale, and the Janis-Field Feelings of Inadequacy Scale, was administered
to the service learning participants and a control group. The posttest consisted
of the same instruments with the addition of a Community Experience Checklist
completed by the service group participants. Paired t-test and Repeated
Measures ANOVAs were performed to measure any differences in scores. Student
journals describing the service participants' experiences were also reviewed.<BR>
<BR>
The hypotheses tested: (1) There is no difference in the self-esteem and
attitudes toward the school and community between high school students who
are involved in a school-sponsored service learning experience and those
who are not involved. (2) There is no difference in select changes in self-esteem
and attitudes toward the school and community between at-risk and minority
high school youth participating in the school-sponsored service learning
program and the other participants in the program. (3) There is no difference
in select changes in self-esteem and attitudes toward the school and community
and the type of school-sponsored service learning program in which the students
participated.<BR>
<BR>
These hypotheses were rejected. Results from the measures employed in this
study demonstrated that certain experimental service learning programs did
have an impact. The success of certain service learning programs may be
influenced by reflective discussions following the activities and the planning
and supervision that went into these programs. (Author)<BR>

TITLE: Meaningful Involvement in Instrumental Activity and Well-Being: Studies
of Older Adolescents and At Risk Urban Teenagers.<BR>
YEAR: 1990<BR>
AVAIL.: American Journal of Community Psychology v18 n2 p297-320 Apr. 1990<BR>
ABSTRACT: Assessed meaningful involvement in instrumental activity (IACT)
(i.e., activity that requires the active use of skills and which leads to
a desired end), social support, and well-being. Study 1 focused on 43 male
and 109 female older adolescents enrolled in college (mean age 18.8 yrs),
and Study 2 focused on 60 urban Black male and 32 pregnant female teen-agers
(mean age 17.1 yrs), 46 of whom were school dropouts. In both studies, meaningful
IACT was positively related to life satisfaction, independent of social
support from friends and from parents. In addition, meaningful IACT was
positively related to self-esteem to a greater extent for male than for
female college students (Study 1) and for school-attending than for school-dropout
urban Black males (Study 2). In Study 2, higher mean levels of meaningful
IACT were reported by school-attending than by school-dropout urban adolescents
and by Black male teens than by pregnant female teens. Author suggests that
policies and programs should be developed to enhance opportunities for adolescents
to engage in meaningful instrumental activity. (NICSL/ PsycINFO Database

TITLE: The Relationship of Community Service Learning to Developing Mature
Interpersonal Relationships in a Sample of University Students<BR>
YEAR: 1992<BR>

NOTES: 137 pages. Ed.D. dissertation, The American University. <BR>
ABSTRACT: This study ascertained university student involvement in community
service, as determined through the Community Service Involvement Inventory
Format-II as a correlate to the developmental task, developing mature interpersonal
relationships (MIR), as defined on and assessed by the Student Developmental
Task and Lifestyle Inventory (SDTLI) (Winston, Miller, &amp; Prince, 1987).
Two hypotheses were developed to guide the study. One postulated that a
significant relationship would be found between MIR and student involvement
in community service, while another contended that such a relationship exists
between MIR and students' perception of the extent to which community service
contributed to their developing mature interpersonal relationships. Each
hypothesis, tested in null form, was rejected.<BR>
<BR>
Data used in hypotheses testing were elicited from 104 students with senior
standing at the University of Redlands, California, in the fall of 1991
and spring of 1992. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and
analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistics were used, respectively, in testing
the two hypotheses.<BR>
<BR>
Study findings led the writer to conclude that (a) community service learning
positively affected the development of mature interpersonal relationships
in the study sample of undergraduate university students, and (b) the total
hours of involvement in community service learning, and the perception of
the extent to which community service contributed to their developing mature
interpersonal relationships, as defined by the MIR task on the SDTLI. Implications
are that university faculty, administrators, and others working in the area
of community service learning need to acknowledge the importance of community
service learning to student development. They must design instructional
programs and services with community service learning in mind to help students
to capitalize on the psycho social growth potential study findings suggest
for community service as part of the undergraduate collegiate experience.<BR>

ABSTRACT: Adolescent drug abuse and suicide are signs that represent young
people's loss of hope for the future. Community service type programs offer
significant potential to help combat adolescent problems that involve low
self esteem and lack of purpose. These interventions contain a helping component
whereby adolescents have an opportunity to develop a sense of purpose by
assisting others. Theoretical and anecdotal evidence suggests that such
programs may be important in nurturing adolescent's social and psychological
development. Empirical evidence is sparse, however, and educational institutions
lack information regarding the helping phenomenon. This investigation was
aimed at answering the question, &quot;What are the psychological and social
effects of community service tasks on adolescents?&quot;. A mixed form (Patton,
1990), quasi- experimental design was used to investigate the research question.
Pretests and posttests were administered to quantitatively measure changes
in adolescents' self esteem, social interest, helping disposition, interpersonal
competencies, and emotional disposition as a result of engaging in community
service activities. Participants were asked to respond to three open ended
questions to provide qualitative data. These questions asked participants:
(1) to describe a significant event during their community service; (2)
whether participants had come to feel differently about themselves as a
result of community service and; (3) whether participants thought they had
become more caring due to their service. Qualitative data demonstrated positive,
self reported changes in self esteem, empathy, relationship development,
felt importance, awareness, and attitudes toward themselves and others.
However, quantitative data showed significant gains in experimental means
on only one of the variables measured (self disclosure) as compared to control
group means. Explanations of the discrepancy between qualitative data and
quantitative data are provided, and suggestions are made for future research.

TITLE: The Effects of High School Community Service Programs on Students'
Social Development. Final Report<BR>
YEAR: 1983<BR>

NOTES: 107 pages. Wisconsin Center for Education Research, Madison.<BR>
ABSTRACT: In recent years, commentators on socialization and adolescent
development have suggested that secondary schools encourage students' participation
in voluntary community service. This study, conducted in 1982-83 on students
in volunteer programs and in comparison groups at eight high schools, tested
whether such programs positively effect the social development of student
volunteers. Through open-ended interviews, pre- and posttests, and a questionnaire,
researchers compared volunteer and non-volunteer groups for: (1) students'
sense of responsibility and concern for the <BR>
welfare of others, (2) students' sense of competence in working on collective
tasks and in dealing with adults, and (3) students' anticipated participation
in adult groups and politics. Also analyzed were social development in problem-solving
skills and students' perceived opportunities to take responsibility and
make decisions. Findings indicate that while community service modestly
increases students' sense of social responsibility and sense of personal
competence, it fails to bring special benefits in sense of school responsibility,
political efficacy, future affiliation, and future political participation.
The conclusion is that developmental opportunities offered in regular school
classes may presently have more impact on social development than specific
opportunities within community programs. (ERIC -- ED 240043)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Purpose of the Study. The purpose of this study was to examine
certain community related values in adults who had participated in school-community
service projects as adolescents during the years 1938 through 1943.<BR>
<BR>
The central question in the study was: Do adults who participated in school-community
service projects as young people demonstrate at a later date greater levels
of community involvement than adults who did not participate in school-community
service projects as young people?<BR>
<BR>
Procedures. For purposes of the study, two Wisconsin school districts were
selected, one district had involvement in school-community service projects,
while the other district did not. Data were then gathered to answer the
central and related questions through a questionnaire. Responses to the
questionnaire were categorized by types of school-community project involvement
and then analyzed with regard to experiences in community participation.<BR>
<BR>
Findings. As a result of the data analyzed, ten findings were noted. Two
of these were: (1) It was found that participants in school-community service
projects as young people are more likely to undertake at a later date leadership
positions in formal organizations than non-participants of school-community
service projects. (2) It was found that school-community service projects
that engage students in working on projects related to improving community
life are more likely to affect later life behavior and values toward community
participation and involvement, than projects that engage students for the
purposes of gaining work experience.<BR>
<BR>
Conclusions. As a result of the findings of this study, ten conclusions
of the study were noted. Two of these were: (1) It is concluded that those
who plan for school-community service projects should involve the students
who will eventually participate in them. (2) It is concluded that those
who plan for school-community service projects should insure that projects
improve community life.<BR>
<BR>
Those concerned with community education must realize that the school-community
service project, and how it is used, determines to a great extent how people
will judge the community school. The research in adult life patterns of
those who participated in school-community service projects may offer a
promising direction for community education. To this end, community education
may once again attempt to reclaim its enthusiasm for providing life-centered
education in the American schools. (Author)<BR>

TITLE: The Effects of Participation in Required and Not Required Community
Service Programs on the Process of Self-Actualization in High School Students<BR>

ABSTRACT: Voluntary community service by high school students has long been
an accepted and encouraged extra-curricular activity. While educators have
cited many potential benefits of community service, relatively few students
have availed themselves of the opportunity. In an effort to maximize the
high school educational experience, many school administrators are requiring
students to participate in community service programs. One benefit often
cited as rationale for required service is self-actualization. This study
examined the differential effects of required, not required, and non-participation
in community service work.<BR>
<BR>
One hundred seventy-five students from five private and five parochial schools
in the New Orleans area participated in the study. The Personal Orientation
Inventory was used as the repeated measure at the start of the study, again
after approximately 20 hours of service work, and finally after about 40
hours of service work. A survey measuring student attitudes towards community
service and family volunteerism was also administered.<BR>
<BR>
Results indicate that less than 20 hours of service work has little impact;
however, required participation for more than 20 hours may have a negative
effect on the process of self-actualization. In addition, effects may be
different for males and females. Family volunteerism did not significantly
affect self-actualization or student attitudes toward community service.<BR>
<BR>
The issue of requiring or not requiring community service work as a graduation
requirement is more complex than previously thought. Implementation of required
service programs should be considered with care. Efforts to attract students
into voluntary community service programs should be increased. (Author)<BR>

TITLE: Construction of an Instrument to Assess the Service Learning Model:
Establishing Concurrent Validity and Internal Reliability<BR>
YEAR: 1992<BR>

NOTES: 216 pages. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Northern Colorado. <BR>
ABSTRACT: A paper and pencil test was constructed to investigate the existence
of phases as identified by the Service Learning Model (Delve, Mintz, &amp;
Stewart, 1990). Subjects with no structured exposure to service-learning
activities residing in the residence halls at the University of Northern
Colorado (UNC) (n = 70) and subjects involved in service-learning programs
coordinated by the Office of Community Service at Colorado State University
(CSU) (n = 65) participated in the study during the spring of 1992.<BR>
<BR>
Research objectives provided guidelines for developing the test format and
writing clear and understandable items that reflected the affective, behavioral
and cognitive ways in which students experience and understand what it is
to be a responsible citizen. No significant relationship was observed between
the phases of the test instrument and parallel learning modes as measured
by the Learning-Styles Inventory. It was suggested that learning styles
transcend the different ways to experience and understand what it is to
be a responsible citizen, and therefore, do not provide an appropriate measure
of concurrent validity. The internal reliability for each phase of the test
instrument was lower than desired, however, the coefficients of internal
consistency showed promise ranging from r =.5266 for Phase 1 to r =.7582
for Phase 3.<BR>
<BR>
Post-hoc tests comparing mean phase scores between colleges and between
categories of self-reported duration of involvement in helping activities
were conducted to supplement a statement of validity for the test instrument.
Differences for mean phase scores between subjects at UNC and CSU were significant
and in the predicted direction. Similar results were observed when mean
phase scores for subjects with eight or fewer contacts over the prior academic
year were compared to subjects with nine or more contacts over the same
period. However, it was unclear if these differences were influenced by
involvement in service-learning activities or personal variables such as
age and class status.<BR>
<BR>
More research needs to be conducted before the Service-Learning Model can
be empirically confirmed or rejected. Recommendations identify several suggestions
for further investigating the validity and reliability of the test instrument.

NOTES: 135 pages. Ed.D. dissertation, West Virginia University. <BR>
ABSTRACT: The study evaluated the panegyrical claims for high school-based
community service programs. Four high school programs from three different
states were selected to represent public, private-parochial, single and
mixed gender, urban, suburban, and rural orientations. A repeated measure
quantitative research design was developed and implemented as well as a
qualitative study involving student and teacher/coordinator interviews.<BR>
<BR>
A survey instrument consisting of three scales-Social Isolation, Powerlessness,
and Political Efficacy - was administered to experimental groups of student
volunteers in each of four schools before and after programs involving student
participation in community activities. The time periods between pre and
post-tests ranged from one semester to the full school year. Likewise, control
groups consisting of students who did not participate in community service
were also administered the survey at the same times. Approximately fifteen
percent of the students in the four experimental groups were personally
interviewed as well as the teacher/coordinators of each program.<BR>
<BR>
Results of the study were mixed. Quantitative analysis disclosed a significant
decrease in students' feelings of Social Isolation in the all-female private,
parochial high school while community service activities in the inner-city
apparently <BR>
produced an increase in feelings of Powerlessness among student volunteers
of a suburban public high school. Furthermore, Operation Desert Storm seemingly
affected the attitudes of the control group on the same scale in the same
school. The qualitative analysis revealed strong support for community service
programs in all four schools from students, teachers, parents, and the community.<BR>
<BR>
The results of the study point out the need for specialized research into
the different kinds of school-based community service programs and their
impact on student feelings and attitudes utilizing a variety of appropriate
instruments tailored to different types of service activities. (Author)<BR>

TITLE: The Concept of Required Helpfulness.<BR>
YEAR: 1979<BR>
AVAIL.: Behaviour Research &amp; Therapy v17 n1 p1-6 <BR>
ABSTRACT: The concept of required helpfulness as used in the present article
refers to dangerous or difficult acts that are performed in response to
social requirements to reduce or prevent other people from experiencing
serious discomfort. Under the incentive of high social demands, helpers
often act more effectively and more persistently than at other times. It
is suggested that the execution of successful acts of required helpfulness
may lead to enduring changes in the helper, and that 3 main factors contribute
to the success of such acts-- level of skill, level of social demand, and
group morale. These factors are discussed in relation to observations of
2 populations--combat soldiers and psychiatric patients. Wartime observations
showed that fear reactions can be controlled to some extent if, during exposure
to stress, the person engages in some form of activity; activities involving
the assumption of responsibility for someone else appear to have particular
fear-reducing or fear-preventing properties. Clinical examples are presented
of 2 psychiatric patients who were able to overcome their own disabilities
and assist someone else who was in great need. It is suggested that acts
of required helpfulness can produce short- or long-term improvements in
performance and longer term increases in competence. (13 ref) (PsycINFO

YEAR: 1988<BR>
AVAIL.: Journal of Applied Psychology v73 n3 p393-401 Aug. 1988 <BR>
ABSTRACT: In this research, I examined three hypotheses concerning the effects
of college internships on individual participants: (a) greater crystallization
of vocational self-concept and work values, (b) less reality shock, and
(c) better employment opportunities. A quasi-experimental design was used
to compare interns from five academic programs with matched cohorts at preinternship,
postinternship, college graduation, and postemployment measurement periods.
Research findings provided partial support for the crystallization hypothesis
and strong support for better employment opportunities. Furthermore, when
the level of autonomy experienced in the internship was considered as a
potential moderating variable, support was found for all three hypotheses.
A second study using an experimental design was conducted to examine the
effect of internship experience on recruiters' evaluation of applicants'
qualifications and their probability of hire. Results from the experimental
study also supported the employment opportunity hypothesis. Implications
of the findings and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO

ABSTRACT: The purpose in this study was to describe how required community
service affected adolescent attitudes toward being personally and socially
responsible and to identify the program variables and practices that are
most effective in facilitating student development.<BR>
<BR>
Two sections of the Experiential Educational Questionnaire, which was developed
by Conrad and Hedin at the Center for Youth Development and Research of
the University of Minnesota, were used in the current study. Student attitudes
toward being socially and personally responsible were measured by the Social
and Personal Responsibility Scale (SPRS). The relative importance of various
aspects of the students' community service was measured by the Characteristics
of a Community Experience Checklist Scale.<BR>
<BR>
The findings of the study indicated: (1) There is no difference in attitudes
towards social and personal responsibility between students who participated
in the required 10 hours of community experiential program and those students
who did not participate as measured by their total SPRS scores. (2) Students
who were involved in the required community service programs for more than
10 hours, regardless of the type of service rendered, demonstrated significant
gains in their attitudes toward personal and social responsibility. (3)
The effects of required community service did not significantly differ from
the effects of voluntary community service indicated by other researchers
using the same instrumentation. (4) Student satisfaction with the program
can be predicted by the ratings they gave to four of the twenty items of
the Community Checklist questionnaire. (5) Multiple positive relationships
were found among the divisions of the SPRS, supporting the interrelationships
of the instrument. (Author)<BR>

NOTES: 319 pages. Ed.D. dissertation, University of Southern California,.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Problem: Extensive Examination of the literature indicated that
the schools' impact upon student democratic growth was minimal. Democratic
growth was conceptualized as movement toward three theoretical constructs:
Moral Development, Self-Actualization, and Political Development. The scope
of the study was limited to Political Development which was defined as consisting
of two attitude dimensions: Open-mindedness and A Sense of Political Efficacy.<BR>
<BR>
It was assumed that the organization patterns, the emphasis on cognition
at the expense of affect, and the lack of continuous organizational self-examination
within the traditional school, blocked desired attitudinal shift. What seemed
to be required was a new environment which would reinforce student attitudinal
changes.<BR>
<BR>
Procedure: The procedure was the establishment of a new environment; a community
based, alternative education program (Newport Plan) characterized by certain
conditions: (1) direct attention was paid to the attitudinal changes of
open-mindedness and political efficacy as the desirable outcomes; (2) direct
attention was paid to the means by which the attitudinal changes occurred;
integration of environmental and personal changes and conscious attention
to affect; (3) direct attention was paid to the creation of a TORI (trust,
openness, realization, interdependent) community -- with emphasis on interdependent
authority relationships -- and uses of the larger community as the curriculum;
and (4) direct attention was paid to organization renewal using the theoretical
constructs and technology of Organization Development.<BR>
<BR>
Four Hypotheses Were Tested: (1) Students within the alternative education
program will demonstrate greater positive attitudinal shifts toward open-mindedness
as measured by the Dogmatism Scale than students in traditional classrooms.
(2) Students within the alternative education program will demonstrate a
greater increase in a sense of political efficacy as measured by the Political
Efficacy Scale than students in traditional classrooms. (3) Students within
the alternative education program will demonstrate more positive responses
to specific factors constituting a &quot;good&quot; educational program
as measured by the researcher's constructed Program Differential than students
in traditional classrooms. (4) Students within the alternative education
program will demonstrate personal and group goals more reflection of an
emergent educational community than students within a traditional classroom.<BR>
<BR>
Findings: All hypotheses, with some reservations, were accepted. Newport
Plan students' attitudes shifted measurably towards greater open-mindedness
and political efficacy compared to two contrast groups. Newport Plan students
rated their program as (1) more favorable than did one contrast group its
program, and about as favorable as did a second contrast group its classroom,
and (2) more reflection of a TORI education community than the second contrast
group.<BR>
<BR>
Conclusions: Several factors were identified as possible contributors to
the attitudinal changes. These included the emotional nature of the Newport
Plan, its ambiguity as perceived by its participants, time, the mixed means
of learning employed, increased student self-insight, the reduction of threat,
the creation of dissonance, and the emphasis upon involvement and ownership
of the ongoing process by the participants. Additional possibilities included
changed authority relationships between teacher and students, the personality
and warmth of the teacher, and student self-selection of curricula in terms
of subject matter an process.<BR>
<BR>
Attitudes changed because the environment changed and the values of that
change were isomorphic with the values implicit in the attitudinal constructs
of open-mindedness and political efficacy.<BR>
<BR>
Recommendations: Educational programs designed to develop democratic man,
a morally and politically competent individual, should consider: (1) structural
and organizational changes, (2) make explicit their responsibility for student
democratic growth, (3) directly emphasize affect, (4) create a humanistic,
value-clear approach to all their endeavors, and (5) engage in continual
self-examination and self-renewal. (Author).<BR>

ABSTRACT: Fourteen primarily minority 7th grade students participated in
a 1 1/2 month long program designed to provide information to motivate youth
in science learning. The focus of the project was the students preparing
for and presenting three science lessons to 5th graders. An assessment tool
based on a classroom behavior checksheet was used to evaluate participants'
behavior and academic changes. Results were mixed, with no changes in behavior
reported for most students. Some positive changes in grades and academic
behavior are noted. Suggestions are made for further study. (NICSL)<BR>

ABSTRACT: The purposes of the study were to (a) investigate the model of
instruction middle school students received through a service-learning project
and students' understanding of the social issue being studied, (b) determine
whether certain variables were related to students' understanding of the
social issue being studied, and (c) learn which instructional components
of the project the students considered most meaningful. The findings could
focus the activity of teachers on instructional practices to achieve desired
affective and academic goals for middle school students. Also, the researcher
hoped to add to the literature on the topic of service-learning that discusses
how effective integration of service into the content-area curriculum can
be ensured.<BR>
<BR>
The study population comprised 524 public middle school students in a suburban
Class B district in central Michigan. The sample included 438 students who
completed a pre inventory, 403 students who completed a post inventory,
22 students interviewed by the researcher, and 63 students who elected to
participate in off-campus service visits.<BR>
<BR>
Two slightly different models of service-learning instruction were studied
in an effort to identify differences in subject-matter achievement and variables
that might contribute to the differences. A locally developed instrument
was used to measure (a) subject-matter achievement, (b) number of extracurricular
activities students participated in, (c) students' involvement in the food
drive, (d) students' exposure to media information, and (e) which activities
related to the food drive were most meaningful to the students. Interviews
were conducted with students to gather data to support or contradict the
inventory data.<BR>
<BR>
The statistical tests and interview data support the following major findings:
(1) Students participating in off-campus service visits appeared to be better
informed about the social issue of hunger than non-service-visit students.
(2) Students receiving the content-integrated model of instruction scored
significantly higher on the subject-matter portion of the post inventory
than students receiving the isolated model of instruction. (3) The instructional
components considered most meaningful to students were those activities
that resulted in an externally valued product-that is, something that provides
validation of the value of one's activities. (Author)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This document investigates the educational impact of service-learning
internships arranged in North Carolina. Emphasis is placed on what students
report they learn in service-learning internships and what conditions support
those learnings [sic]. Results indicate the learning benefits most frequently
felt by student interns was (1) the development of more hopeful, knowledgeable
and concerned attitudes toward community problem solving, (2) increased
motivation to work and learn in communities, (3) the opportunity for personal
learning in the realm of action, and (4) immediate impact on student intern
behavior and plans of the future. The learning impact of the internship
is, however, greatly reduced by the lack of appropriate follow-up when the
student returns to campus. (ERIC -- ED 080051)<BR>

ABSTRACT: We report on an experiment in integrating community service into
a large undergraduate political science course. Students in two randomly
selected discussion sections participated in 20 hours of service with local
agencies as part of this course. Students in six other sections completed
research papers requiring an equivalent amount of work. Other than that,
all students attended the same bi-weekly lectures and had the same assigned
readings and examinations. In a post-course survey, students in service-learning
sections were significantly more likely than students in the control sections
to report that they had performed up to their potential in the course, had
learned to apply principles from the course to new situations, and had developed
a greater awareness of societal problems. We also found that classroom learning
and course grades increased significantly as a result of students' participation
in course-relevant community service. Finally, analyses of responses to
a pre/post survey revealed a number of significant effects of participation
in community service upon students' personal values and orientations. The
experiential learning acquired through service appears to compensate for
some pedagogical weakness of classroom instruction.&quot; (Authors)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This study examined opportunities for high school students to
become involved in higher levels of thinking through service-learning. Higher
levels of thinking is defined as all cognitive indicators above the knowledge
level in Bloom's taxonomy. Service-learning is defined as a curriculum approach
to experiential learning.<BR>
<BR>
Two instruments were developed and administered to a sample of fifty suburban
high school students. The Service-Learners' Self-Perceptive Inventory, measured
students' frequency of involvement in higher levels of thinking. Descriptive
statistics including frequencies, means, and standard deviations were derived
from the inventory. The Service-Learners' Directed Log assessed the quality
of student performance involving higher levels of thinking. To analyze the
data from this instrument regarding the issue of time spent on site and
involvement in higher levels of thinking, a Kruskal-Wallis procedure was
used. In addition, a Spearman Rho was calculated to look for potential correlations
existing between the students' Differential Aptitude Test and the California
Test of Mental Maturity and their higher level thinking score.<BR>
<BR>
Analysis of the data collected disclosed: (1) that both the service-learners'
quality of performance score, and its self-perceptive score, showed its
students were offered an opportunity to be involved in higher levels of
thinking through participation in service-learning; (2) that the amount
of time spent in Service-Learning did not promote higher levels of thinking;
and, (3) that the all-school test scores (Differential Aptitude Test, California
Test of Mental Maturity) did not correlate with the higher levels of thinking
scores.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the data supported the contention that service-learning provides
an opportunity for higher levels of thinking to take place. As a result,
the researcher recommends that high school personnel consider service-learning
as a potential instructional strategy for incorporating higher levels of
thinking in teaching. (Author)<BR>

ABSTRACT: From dropout prevention to civic education, youth service programs
often have differing goals. A study of the Community-Based Learning program,
a Job Training Partnership Act sponsored dropout prevention effort which
focuses on youth service, career exploration, civic education, and academic
development, demonstrated that learning in the community can be effective
in improving attendance and school grades, as will as helping students to
learn. One major contributor to this success is the introduction of adults
and college students and college students from the community into the educational
process, encouraging more human and personal interaction both on and off
campus. (Author)<BR>

ABSTRACT: The present study investigated the effects of key characteristics
of service-learning experiences (such as autonomy, instructional support
for the experience, and so on) on the cognitive, moral and ego identity
development of undergraduates. Participants in service-learning courses
and control students wrote pre- and post-responses to social problems. Service-learning
students also completed weekly journals and an evaluation of their experiences.
Results revealed significant gains for the service-learning participants
on certain cognitive dimensions, such as awareness of multidimensionality.
Aspects of the experience predicted cognitive gains as well as gains in
prosocial reasoning. Paired t-tests revealed significant increases in prosocial
decision-making, prosocial reasoning and identity processing. (Author)<BR>

teachers, effects on students' socialization, behavior, attitudes, attendance,
academic skills, functional skills, and relationships with non-disabled
peers are explored. Promising results are found for adolescents with mild
disabilities in attendance and academic skills, and for adolescents with
moderate to profound disabilities in socialization and relationships with
non-disabled peers. Implications for school inclusion of students with disabilities
are addressed and recommendations for areas of future study are made. (Author)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This research evaluated the effects of involvement of adolescents
in community service activities on levels of alienation. It was proposed
that alienation could be reduced through the implementation of a model which
utilized community service activities to facilitate adolescent access to
adult society, development of responsibility, collaborative and cooperative
work, and control over planning and outcomes. It is suggested that adolescent
involvement in service activities can produce positive benefits, among which
are reduced levels of alienation, improved school behavior, improved grade
point average, and acceptance by the adult community. These findings also
suggest that females respond more positively to school when allowed to problem-solve
collectively and collaboratively. (Authors)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This study was undertaken to assess the impact of experiential
education programs on the social, psychological and intellectual development
of secondary school students and to empirically identify the program variables
which most effectively promote such development.<BR>
<BR>
The study involved over 600 students from 11 experimental 4 control groups
in 9 schools across the United States. The experiential programs were categorized
according to their primary focus: community service, outdoor adventure,
career exploration, and community study. They were defined as: &quot;educational
programs offered as an integral part of the general school curriculum, but
taking place outside of the conventional classroom, where students are in
new roles featuring significant tasks with real consequences, and where
the emphasis is on learning through doing with associated reflection.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the first chapter the history of experiential education is summarized
with special emphasis on the parallel between it and the progressive education
movement in the United States. Chapter Two summarizes the theoretical arguments
for experiential education and reviews the empirical evidence relating to
its effectiveness in promoting social, psychological and intellectual development.<BR>
<BR>
In Chapter Three the methodology of the study is described. Students were
given a battery of tests pre and post. The tests included the Rest Defining
Issues Test, the Janis-Field Feelings of Inadequacy Scale, the Rosenberg
Self-Esteem Scale, and Career Exploration Questionnaire, three Semantic
Differentials on attitudes (toward adults, toward being active in the community,
and toward the kinds of people with whom they interacted in the community),
a Social and Personal Responsibility Scale, and a Problem Solving Inventory.
The latter two tests were developed by the author for this study. Data on
student background characteristics were also collected. In addition, each
student evaluated his/her program and completed a Characteristics of Experience
checklist.<BR>
<BR>
The data were analyzed in two phases. In the first, pre and post results
were compared for each experimental and control group. In the second, specific
program features were examined to assess their influence on change scores:
type, length, intensity of the experience; existence of a reflective component;
student background characteristics; and the nature of the individual experience
(e.g., how interesting, how demanding of responsibility). The analytical
tools employed included t-tests, analysis of variance, and multiple regression.<BR>
<BR>
Chapter Four presents the results of the study. In general the experiential
programs did have a positive impact on psychological, social and intellectual
growth. Students in experiential programs showed positive, and statistically
significant (t-test, P = &lt; .05), change on moral reasoning, two measures
of self-esteem, career maturity, social and personal responsibility, attitudes
toward adults, toward being active in the community, toward other people,
and in the complexity and empathy demonstrated in solving problems. In contrast,
students in regular school programs showed significant positive change on
only two measures: the Janis-Field Scale and a sub scale on Career Information.
The gains by experimental students exceeded those of students in comparison
groups on every scale and sub scale in the test battery.<BR>
<BR>
While the results indicated a generally positive impact by experiential
programs, there were important differences both within and between programs.<BR>
<BR>
The strongest predictors of positive change proved to be the characteristics
of the experiences as reported by individual students: the degree to which
they perceived themselves as assuming adult responsibility, making important
decisions, making a significant contribution, and having the freedom to
develop and use their own ideas and interests. In short, the most powerful
experiences were those in which students participated with substantial autonomy
in activities that made a difference.<BR>
<BR>
Among general program features, the strongest factor influencing change
was the existence of a reflective seminar. Smaller, but perceivable advantages
were found for programs lasting at least 18 weeks and where students were
in the community 4 or 5 days each week. General program type (e.g., outdoor
adventure, community service) and student background characteristics were
not consistently discriminating factors.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, 96% of the participants rated their program as &quot;excellent&quot;
or &quot;good,&quot; and 76% reported learning &quot;more&quot; or &quot;much
more&quot; than in regular school classes.<BR>
<BR>
Chapter Five summarizes the study and suggests implications for practice.
Chief among them is that schools include direct community experience as
an integral part of their academic programs. (Author)<BR>

NOTES: 55 pages.<BR>
ABSTRACT: In order to fill the gap in obtaining hard evidence to test or
document the impact of experience-based education on student participants,
the Experiential Education Evaluation Project was undertaken May, 1978 and
administered to 4,000 students in 33 programs. There were four major types
of programs: volunteer service, career internships, outdoor adventure, and
community study/political action. Specific purposes were: (1) to define
experiential education and develop a typology of programs; (2) to assess
impact of experiential education programs on psychological, social and intellectual
development of secondary school students; (3) to identify existing measures
and instruments and to design new ones for assessing these outcomes; and
(4) to use data to identify program variables and practices that were effective
in facilitating student development. Five test instruments and two questionnaires
were used to measure students' social, psychological and intellectual development.
Data were analyzed in two phases: pre-post results were compared for each
experimental and comparison group and specific features of programs were
examined to assess their influence. Findings included experiential education
programs had positive impact on students' psychological, social and intellectual
development and characteristics of the experiences of individual students
were powerful predictors of growth. (ERIC -- ED 215823)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This report summarizes the research and results of the Evaluation
of Experiential Learning Project, undertaken to (1) assess the impact of
experiential learning programs on the social, psychological, and intellectual
development of secondary school students; and (2) use these data to identify
those program variables most effective in facilitating such development.
The project evaluated 30 experiential learning programs in independent,
public, and parochial schools around the United States during 1978 and 1979.
Program activities examined included volunteer service, political and social
action, outdoor adventure, internships in government and business, and research
in the community. The results of the study demonstrated that experiential
programs had a positive impact on student participants. The opportunities
to act autonomously and to develop collegial relationships with adults were
the two features of each student's experience that were the most powerful
predictors of personal growth. Regular seminars for program participants
were found to be the most important positive program feature. Appended to
this report are: (1) an extensive bibliography, (2) test instruments and
questionnaires utilized in the evaluation, and (3) a lengthy review of the
theoretical foundations and recent research on experiential education. (ERIC

ABSTRACT: The challenge of building assessment into the curriculum has led
the author to closely examine the expected outcomes of her teaching. Her
experiences with students participating in projects that involved helping
needy people in the community demonstrate the difficulty and advantages
of implementing authentic assessment. The middle school students she teaches
have collected items for the needy, conducted a cross-cultural study of
the community, and planned visits to a retirement home. All of these projects
have taught students the importance of teamwork, along with problem-solving
skills and consensus decision making skills. Students are also responsible
for assisting in the development of evaluation criteria and assessments.
Some assessment approaches that have been used are: (1) performance rating
scales; (2) video assessment; (3) demonstrations; (4) audio tapes; and (5)
written reflections on the activity. Benefits to the students and benefits
to the teacher are recognized. (ERIC -- ED 361376)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Unpaid community activities have been widely recommended as learning
experiences for adolescents. An evaluation was conducted of two community
action learning programs, one which placed adolescents one-to-one in adult-dominated
settings and the other which gave adolescents a group project to plan and
carry out with adult assistance. Both programs appeared to have parental
support and to give participants the opportunity to form close relationships
with adults. The Experience-Based Career Education and Executive High School
Intern Programs placed adolescents in work settings without pay for extended
periods of time. Evaluations of these programs by several investigators
found similar patterns of strong support from parents and participants without
strong objective evidence of learning. Findings support the need for a more
differentiated approach to learning in the community than has been taken
in the past, and suggest that such learning should be viewed as complementary
to classroom learning rather than as a replacement, and that unpaid experiences
can offer some kinds of opportunities not usually found in jobs that are
open to adolescents. (Author)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This study measured selected changes in high school students as
a result of community involvement and participation in order to realize
the goal of responsible citizenship. It was designed to ascertain whether
students who experienced community service displayed more positive attitudes
toward learning than students who had not experienced community service.<BR>
<BR>
The study investigated changes in the areas of: student attitudes toward
future life goals as measured by actual behaviors in planning and exploring
careers, feelings of personal adequacy or inadequacy as measured by self-esteem
in social situations, attitudes toward helping others as measured by social
and personal responsibility indices, attitudes toward responsible community
and school citizenship as measured by attendance and disciplinary referrals.<BR>
<BR>
Three hundred urban high school students who were enrolled in the &quot;general&quot;
course of study were administered pretests. One hundred thirty-six of the
original one hundred fifty experimental group students completed the posttest
after finishing thirty hours of community learning/service activities. One
hundred twenty six control group students completed the posttest. Student
attendance and disciplinary referrals were examined, and interviews were
conducted with ten students and five teachers.<BR>
<BR>
The following research hypotheses were tested: (1) There is a difference
in attitudes toward school, toward helping others, and toward future life
goals as measured by three attitude scales between urban high school students
who are involved in a community based learning/service experience and those
who are not involved in such an experience. (2) There is a difference in
the level of active community involvement and students' commitment to the
educational goal of responsible citizenship as measured by better school
attendance between urban high school students who are involved in a community
based learning/service experience and those who are not involved in such
an experience. (3) There is a difference in the level of active community
involvement and students' commitment to the educational goal of responsible
citizenship as measured by fewer school disciplinary offenses between urban
high school students who are involved in a community based learning/service
experience and those who are not involved in such an experience.<BR>
<BR>
A t-test was performed on pretest control and experimental group sample
means and variances in order to determine the suitability of the groups
for comparison. A paired sample t-test, a one way analysis of variance,
a three way analysis of variance, and a discriminant analysis were used
to treat the data.<BR>
<BR>
Changes within experimental and control groups were calculated by comparing
pre and posttest means and variances in each group treating the groups as
wholes, and then by examining males and females separately. Forty-eight
variables were grouped into ten clustering variables: Career, Traditional
Career, Social Welfare, Duty, Competence, Efficacy, Performance, Inadequacy,
Absence, Referral.<BR>
<BR>
Results of the data analysis provided support for the hypotheses. The following
conclusions were reached: (1) Students who were involved in the experiential
learning/service program demonstrated positive and significant gains in
planning and career exploration behaviors. (2) Students who were involved
in the experiential learning/service program demonstrated positive and significant
gains in responsible attitudes toward others, in competence to act upon
the feeling of concern for others, and in the sense of efficacy which permits
one to believe that taking action and demonstrating concern can make a difference.
(3) Students who were involved in experiential learning/service programs
demonstrated positive and significant gains in their feelings of self esteem
and personal adequacy in social situations. (4) Students who were involved
in experiential programs demonstrated positive and significant gains in
school attendance and in acceptable school behaviors. (Author) <BR>

ABSTRACT: Institutions of higher education are integrating community service
as an element of the undergraduate experience, and influential politicians
and national organizations are creating policies that connect service and
education, despite the lack of scholarly research into the effects of service
participation on the students who serve. The purpose of this research was
to clarify the intended outcomes of Service-Learning participation for college
students who serve, as described by &quot;influentials&quot; that promote
Service-Learning as an undergraduate experience; and to describe the effects
of Service-Learning participation on college students who serve, as perceived
by students who serve.<BR>
<BR>
The study is descriptive and analytical. Qualitative methods of inquiry,
including content analysis of documents and individual and focus group interviews,
were used at two levels: The Institutional Level - One institution of higher
education was selected for a case-study. Four campus constituencies were
represented-the administration, faculty, program managers, and students;
The National Level - The researcher studied one national organization that
promotes collegiate community service, and policy makers who sponsored service-learning
legislation.<BR>
<BR>
The researcher explicated thirteen (13) distinctive themes of service-learning
outcomes: Personal Connections, Career Development/Goal Setting, Change,
Competencies, Contribution, Spiritual Development, Commitment, Clarification
of Values, Confrontation, Cognitive Connections / Curriculum, Self-Concept,
Civic Participation, and Emotions. The findings reveal considerable harmony,
as well as dissonance between the influentials' intended outcomes and the
students' perceived effects.<BR>
<BR>
Analysis of service-learning discourse extracted common words and phrases
through which the conceptual themes for outcomes are conveyed, many of which
begin with the letter &quot;C&quot; and are communicated in musical metaphors.
Thus, the researcher developed the &quot;Lexicon of Intended Outcomes for
Service-Learning as an Element of the Curriculum in Higher Education-The
Key of C&quot;, which simplifies, organizes, and clarifies the themes and
related vocabulary of service-learning outcomes.<BR>
<BR>
The study elicits a broad and diverse range of perspectives, integrates
concepts, and explicates the spectrum of outcomes of student community service-learning.
The findings provide a basis for informed and planful policy and program
design, a model for institutional goal clarification and assessment, and
the foundation for further service-learning research. (Author)<BR>

ABSTRACT: In 1989 the Lilly Endowment launched the &quot;Research Grants
Program on Youth and Caring&quot; to provide small grants for research projects
that would begin to investigate issues relating to the concept of &quot;caring&quot;
in order to guide research and inform practice. This report contains four
parts. Part One describes the development of the project and briefly explores
the meaning of caring as a conceptual foundation. Part Two is an overview
and synthesis of the research funded to date. Part Three contains summaries
of eight papers commissioned for the project for a February 1992 conference.
Part Four, constituting over half of the report, is devoted to an extensive
&quot;Youth and Caring Bibliography.&quot; The bibliography contains 468
citations, many of them annotated, organized according to the following
fifteen themes: Caring: Definitions, Determinants of Caring Behavior, the
Development of Altruism, Moral Development and Moral Reasoning, Adolescent
Development, Family as a Context, Cultural and Ethnic Diversity, Gender
Differences in Caring and Adolescent Development, Adolescents and the Educational

ABSTRACT: This paper is a status report on efforts to make community service
a part of the educational experience of high school students. It reviews
the current educational debate, describes policies and practices including
specific programs, summarizes research findings on the impact of service,
and suggests some critical issues that confront educational researchers,
policy makers, and practitioners. Some highlights of the report are as follows:
(1) as of the mid-1980s, more than one-fourth of high schools offered community
service programs for their students; (2) the most common means of service
is through co- curricular school clubs and special school events such as
holiday food drives; (3) some high schools, especially Catholic and private
schools, require service to meet graduation requirements; (4) arguments
in favor of service in the curriculum have appeared in the literature since
the turn of the century; (5) some proponents of the practice emphasize the
character-building potential of service, its power to promote basic democratic
values and to develop patterns of responsible behavior; (6) others stress
the potential of service to vitalize education by stressing that it requires
the application of academic learning; (7) there is general agreement that
a heightened sense of personal and social responsibility, more positive
attitudes toward adults and toward those served, enhanced self-esteem, growth
in moral and ego development, and complex patterns of thought result from
service programs; and (8) research and the testimony of participants both
support the idea that school-based community service merits further trial.
The document includes 45 references and an appendix listing publications
and resource organizations for developing service programs. (ERIC -- ED

YEAR: 1991<BR>
AVAIL.: Phi Delta Kappan v72 n10 p743-749 June 1991 (Reprint: UnCover)<BR>
ABSTRACT: In this article, the authors aim to present both the arguments
for including community service in the educational programs of elementary
and secondary schools and the research findings on the impact of service.
After tracing the idea of service in past educational literature, the rationale
and possible outcomes of service are outlined as presented by those who
advocate service as a way to reform youth and those who stress the reform
of education. The various methodological problems confronting research into
the effects of service are described prior to a review of the research findings.
Research is divided into quantitative and qualitative approaches. While
neither approach yields conclusive evidence for or against school based
service, research tends to suggest positive outcomes. (36 references) (NICSL)<BR>

TITLE: The Impact of Experience on Academic Learning: A Summary of Theories
and Review of Recent Research<BR>
YEAR: 1983<BR>
AVAIL.: EDRS: ED 250356 / PC01 <BR>
NOTES: 25 pages.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This review of the relationship between experiential education
and intellectual development/academic learning is organized as follows:
first, the theoretical arguments are presented, followed by a review of
recent related research. It focuses primarily on experiential education
for secondary students, though research on college-level programs is very
briefly summarized. The theoretical case considers experiential education
as a method of learning, as a guard against meaningless abstraction, as
an extension of one's world, and as a stimulus for personal learning. Experiential
learning may be viewed as a mode of learning, as a process, or as a style
of learning. While the strength of the theoretical case for intellectual
development through experiential education is substantial, empirical research
to validate these claims is of a more modest scale. The empirical research
does underscore two important points: (1) experience-based programs are
series of program experiences shaped by individualistic motives; and (2)
experiential education programs are often a hidden curriculum expressed
largely through vague and imprecise goals. (ERIC -- ED 250356)<BR>

NOTES: 26 pages.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This report presents the findings of an evaluation of goal accomplishment
at Young Volunteers in Action (YVA) projects at three sites: Alexander City,
Alabama; Gainesville, Florida; and New Orleans, Louisiana. First, a brief
introduction describes the YVA program and discusses the evaluation approach.
The next three sections present case studies of each site. A concluding
section examines the projects' findings and primary effects. Generally,
the evaluation found good goal accomplishment at the sites. Focus is placed
on four major goals: (1) to mobilize the efforts of full- or part-time students,
ages 14-22, in a focused and effective way, as volunteers (generally good
accomplishment is reported); (2) to provide part-time or short-term service-learning
(strong accomplishment at all three sites is reported; (3) to strengthen
and supplement efforts to eliminate poverty and poverty-related human, social,
and environmental problems (findings vary at each site, with accomplishment
reported as poor at Gainesville and very strong at New Orleans); and (4)
to create a sense of self-worth and civic pride (strong accomplishment reported
at all three sites). Positive effects mentioned at the three sites involved
the volunteers' acquisition of new skills, testing of possible career choices,
and experiencing a job-like situation for the first time. An appendix describes
the 37 individual volunteer workstations, volunteer activities, and recipients
at the three sites. (ERIC -- ED 273686)<BR>

ABSTRACT: The Student Service and Philanthropy Project (SSPP) was designed
to afford students an opportunity to assume leadership roles in promoting
positive social change in their community. This document presents a 1992-93
evaluation of the SSPP concerning the program's implementation and the perceptions
of its success on the part of students and project coordinators. Each school
provided a project coordinator who had experience in promoting student involvement
in community service. The project provided a course for students to learn
what foundations are and how they operate and to develop requisite skills.
Students also oversaw the projects funded by a mini foundation and directly
participated in at least one such project. Benefits of the project, according
to the students, included learning to make decisions, developing self-esteem,
developing confidence about speaking in front of an audience, assuming greater
responsibility, setting higher standards, and working with other people
in the pursuit of common goals. Project coordinators praised the project
for empowering students to make decisions about meaningful issues and helping
them develop many important skills. They believed that it combined learning
with practical experience in a way that gave students confidence in their
ability to have an impact on the world in which they live. An appendix provides
a list of community service projects funded. (ERIC -- ED 366675)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Under Subtitle B Part I, Serve-America, of the National and Community
Service Act of 1990, $1.1 million was awarded to fund 44 school-based service-learning
programs in Pennsylvania. A study collected data on program implementation
and impact on students, Serve-America coordinators, and supervisors during
visits to 43 sites and at meetings with site coordinators. Disseminator
(schools and community-based organizations) and mini grant (service-learning)
programs were funded. Five variables were evaluated as indicators of implementation:
organizational <BR>
commitment, integration, parental support, advisory councils, and materials.
Ten percent of all programs benefited from all five variables being strong
and reinforcing. More than 50 percent were implemented as planned. Generally,
students <BR>
expressed satisfaction, but their dissatisfactions included lack of support
from school staff and other students, not enough time at sites, and insufficient
clarity concerning the program and their roles. The program increased coordinators'
personal satisfaction and excitement, but added stress and work. Service-learning
had both a positive and negative impact on supervisors. Stressors were longevity
and institutionalization of the programs, loss of funding, and involvement
of all students. Challenges were identified, and recommendations were made
to develop a vision statement and a work plan. Three elements of an evaluation
system were already in place: empowered evaluation, tracking and monitoring,
and mentoring/consultant infrastructure. (ERIC -- ED 362693)<BR>

AVAIL.: EDRS: ED 170357 / PC02 <BR>
NOTES: 33 pages. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational
Research Association (63rd, San Francisco, California, April 8-12, 1979)<BR>
ABSTRACT: Suggestions for evaluating experiential learning programs, especially
the effects of various forms of experiential learning on different types
of learners, are discussed. Evaluation designs currently in use involve
a four-tier hierarchy: (1) participant responses; (2) use of measurement
instruments; (3) attribution of measurable effects to a particular program;
and (4) attribution of particular effects to various properties of a program.
The author believes there has been little success in tiers three and four
of the hierarchy. Recommendations for future evaluation studies at level
four are proposed, including the development of measurement instruments
and research design. Types of needed measurement instruments include developmental
interviews and direct observations of behavior. Research design recommendations
apply to programs with specific objectives, and include use of pilot programs,
contrived experiments in which programs are specifically developed for evaluation
purposes, and researcher-program staff cooperation to plan programs which
can be evaluated experimentally. Questions to be addressed in developing
the research design concern learner characteristics and school performance,
and whether students are participating in adult-directed activities, or
in student directed programs in order to achieve student-initiated goals.

Report for Arizona's &quot;Serve-America&quot; Program<BR>
YEAR: 1993<BR>
AVAIL.: EDRS: ED 359661 / PC04<BR>
NOTES: 86 pages. <BR>
ABSTRACT: Arizona's Serve-America Project is a K-12 community service program
funded by the National and Community Service Act of 1990. Through formal
school/community agency and youth organization/community agency partnerships,
the project is designed to: (1) encourage school-age and out-of-school youth
to volunteer their services; (2) increase the number of adult volunteers
in Arizona's schools; (3) provide productive, meaningful educational experiences
for participants; and (4) emphasize coordination of community agencies.
This report describes outcomes achieved by 15 out of the 17 participating
projects for 1993. Based on self-reports, programs identified their strengths,
some of which include effective student learning components, individualized
volunteer service, community involvement, volunteer empowerment, staff commitment,
and public recognition. Improvement is needed in the following areas: use
of advisory committees; volunteer recruitment; staff reflection; staff/volunteer
training; and interagency coordination. It is recommended that evaluators
develop clear, operational definitions of terms and work more closely with
programs in refining their service learning elements. Two tables and two
figures are included. Appendices contain program descriptions, evaluation
directions and forms, and demographic data. (Contains 30 references.) (ERIC

of Columbia Public Schools, School Year 1991-92<BR>
YEAR: 1992<BR>
AVAIL.: EDRS: ED 352395 / PC01 <BR>
NOTES: 24 pages.<BR>
ABSTRACT: The pilot project of the District of Columbia Public Schools Community
Service Initiative was implemented during the spring of the 1991-92 school
year. Two schools participating in the project were surveyed (including
35 students and 2 principals) regarding views on initiative merits and outcomes.
Both schools engaged students in community service activities as well as
a preparatory class focusing on self-perceptions, behaviors, and interpersonal
relationships. Findings of the evaluation indicate that the initiative has
the support of students and school administrators, and both groups seem
optimistic about parental support as well. Students participated in a variety
of voluntary activities and class preparations that enhanced their self-confidence
and self-worth. Such attitudes prevailed among students regardless of their
schools' general academic standings or the specific structures of the community
service programs. However, school administrators were apprehensive about
their ability to implement the program fully because of limited personnel
resources. There also were administrative concerns about staff roles and
responsibilities required for successful implementation of the program.
Four tables and 15 bar graphs supplement the discussion. An appendix lists
the community service activities. (ERIC -- ED 352395)<BR>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<BR>
This topic bibliography is produced in response to numerous requests from
service and education practitioners for information on intergenerational
issues and programs. Additional records have been added in this most recent
revision. The primary source for the below citations and annotations is
the Eduational Resources Information Center's (ERIC) database of Resources
In Education and Current Index to Journals in Education. This material is
supplemented by references from a draft bibliography by Generations United
as well as some resources abstracted by the National Information Center
for Service-Learning. Records from each source are indicated by ERIC, GU,
and NICSL, respectively, following the abstract.<BR>
<BR>
Citations are divided among three sections. Section One contains records
which provide an overview of intergenerational issues or background information
on intergenerational service. Section Two lists sources useful in developing
programs such as guidelines, research and models. Finally, Section Three
contains sources which describe a variety of intergenerational service programs.
<H3>Acquiring and Ordering Publications</H3>
<BR>
A goal of this topic bibliography is not only to provide interested researchers
and practitioners with a list of citations but to aid in making the actual
sources available in their full form for use. To this end, each record contains
availability information which should enable everyone to locate and use
the item. <BR>
<BR>
In general, the easiest and least expensive way to have access to the publications
is through your local library. Even if you are not near a university research
library, most smaller libraries have interlibrary loan (ILL) agreements
at no <BR>
or little cost to their patrons. The alternative to libraries is to go through
commercial document reproduction and delivery services. These offer a convenient
way to get copies of serial articles and other documents for those willing
to pay for the service. The different forms of publications mean there are
variations in how to get a copy to use. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ERIC Documents</B><BR>
The U.S. Department of Education's Educational Resources Information Center
(ERIC) collects resources in education which might not normally be widely
disseminated. The ERIC Document Reproduction Service (EDRS) provides both
microfiche and paper copy reproductions of these documents. To order you
will need the ERIC Document number (ED) which can be found in the &quot;AVAIL.&quot;
field of those documents reproduced by EDRS. See the attached copy of their
order form for further ordering and pricing information. The original producer
of a publication might also be a source for copies. When possible, contact

NOTES: 65 p.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This report presents the feelings, ideas, and recommendations
of 349 individuals in Illinois who attended Circle of Helping meetings,
seven regional meetings held in early 1990 to create momentum for intergenerational
program development, to increase awareness of the benefits of intergenerational
programs, and to emphasize the interdependence of generations. A summary
of the meetings focuses on such issues as generational conflict and harmony,
aging education, getting started, intergenerational communication, and public
relations. A section on strategies for the future considers the possibility
of schools in the future including older adults as an integral part of all
educational levels. A total of 13 recommendations are made in the areas
discussed in the summary section. One important aspect of the Circle of
Helping meetings was to highlight model intergenerational programs already
in operation; a section on intergenerational service-learning model programs
briefly describes such programs in the areas of national intergenerational
programs, day care, nursing home visiting, career days, adopt-a-grandparent/child,
reading and literacy, tutoring, students serving seniors, latchkey programs,
pen pals, mentoring, library programs, special events, guest lectures, oral
history/interviewing/ storytelling, patient simulation, social clubs and
camps, drug abuse prevention, pregnancy prevention, advocacy, delinquency
prevention, the arts, and health. Education model programs for the aged
are also described. Relevant materials are appended. (ERIC--ED 339005)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This study examines the relationships developed between elder
mentors and at-risk youth in the following exemplary intergenerational programs:
(1) IUE/The Work Connection (Saugus, Massachusetts); (2) Teen Moms (Portland,
Maine); (3) School Volunteers for Boston (Massachusetts); (4) Teenage Parent
Alternative Program (Lincoln Park, Michigan); and (5) Teaching-Learning
Communities (TLC) Mentors Program (Ann Arbor, Michigan). Information was
obtained from site visits, a conference, interviews with professionals in
the field of adolescent development, a review of the literature on adolescent
institutions, and a brief review of intergenerational programming. Summary
findings include the following: (1) primary and secondary relationships
between elders and youth will form in programs designed for that purpose;
(2) primary relationships are characterized by attachments approximating
kinship, while secondary relationships maintained more emotional distance;
(3) both elders and youth cited benefits from the relationships; (4) the
most effective elders were those who had not lived what would be considered
&quot;successful&quot; lives; (5) intergenerational bonds form because of
shared emotional needs; and (6) programs were most effective when elders
were placed in nonprofessional roles, given on-going support, and contact
was structured. The appendices include a directory of the programs studied,
a list of reviewers and the experts interviewed, and a topic guide used
in interviewing the older people. A 75-item list of references is also included.

NOTES: 12 p. Remarks to the National Association of Partners in Education
(Baltimore, MD, March 21, 1989.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Volunteers can make significant contributions in service to children
and youth both by working on behalf of education and by augmenting the learning
that schools provide. The merger of the National School Volunteer Program
and the National Symposium on Partnerships in Education to form the National
Association of Partners in Education is seen as an important development
for voluntary activity and advocacy for youth. This presentation addresses
four major <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
points. First, the gap between adults and young people, due in part to changes
in family structure and the inability of schools to cope with complex problems,
calls for increased intervention and initiatives by volunteers. Second,
mentoring programs can position volunteers to assist the educational enterprise
by providing tutorial, social, and personal support; the role of caring
adults is seen as increasingly important in the lives of young people. Third,
fundamental principles underlying volunteer work with schools and young
people include the notions of responsibility to the community and &quot;interconnectedness,&quot;
and voluntarism should promote commitment to helping others, as well as
academic success, as integral to growth to maturity. Fourth, voluntarism
in the schools must be expanded to other aspects of the lives of children
and youth through links to the family and community. (ERIC--ED 310182)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Intergenerational programs and policy approaches are needed for
the following reasons: (1) the interdependence of generations; (2) the aging
of the population; (3) the imperative of community participation and service;
(4) changes in family structure and caregiving; and (5) stereotypes of intergenerational
conflict and competition. Intergenerational exchange can contribute significantly
to contemporary American society. (ERIC--EJ 394571)<BR>

NOTES: 102p. <BR>
ABSTRACT: As part of a 4-year research initiative on adult/youth relationships
programs, this study assessed relationships between elders and at-risk youth
at the following four Linking Lifetimes intergenerational mentoring demonstration
sites developed by Temple University's Center for Intergenerational Learning
in Philadelphia (Pennsylvania): (1) Neighborhood Youth Association in Los
Angeles (California); (2) Metro Dade Department of Youth and Family Development
in Miami (Florida); (3) Porter Leath Children's Center in Memphis (Tennessee);
and (4) Corporation for Public Management in Springfield (Massachusetts).
Elders were 55 years old and older, and youth were 12 to 17 years old. Using
26 pairs of 1 youth and 1 elder, the study examined pair activities, the
relationship formation process, and effective and ineffective practices
in the relationships. Elders met between 4 and 10 hours a week with youth
and received stipends and reimbursements for expenses. Separate face-to-face
semistructured interviews with all subjects were conducted at two times.
Seventeen pairs were satisfying and 9 pairs were dissatisfying to the participants.
The pairs' particular activities did not determine satisfaction. Differences
existed in participants' interaction styles. Elders in satisfying relationships
allowed the content and timing of the relationships to be youth-driven.
Included are 5 tables, 33 references, and 2 appendixes describing the Linking
Lifetimes initiative and study methodology in 2 tables. (ERIC--ED 348425)<BR>

YEAR: 1992<BR>
AVAIL.: EDRS: ED 369775 / PC05.<BR>
NOTES: 108p.<BR>
ABSTRACT: As the fastest-growing segment of society, older adults can be
valuable resources for schools. The intent of this guide is to promote education
for, with, and about older adults; to confront stereotypic images; and to
present an accurate and balanced view of aging. The manual consists of 21
lesson plans for secondary teachers of health and home economics. Suggested
activities are designed to address existing curricular objectives, promote
interdisciplinary instruction, help students develop healthy attitudes toward
their own aging, realize the lifelong importance of decisions they make
as young adults, and understand the interdependence of all age groups. Lesson
plans are divided into five sections. The first section, &quot;Attitudes
about Aging,&quot; addresses children's attitudes toward old people. The
lessons in section 2, &quot;Normal Aging Process,&quot; focus on physical
and sensory changes in later life, psychological facts on aging, and myths
about memory loss. Section 3, &quot;Making Healthy Life Choices,&quot; deals
with skin care, exercise, nutrition, healthy lifestyles, and alcohol abuse.
The fourth section, &quot;Intergenerational Issues,&quot; covers similarities
between young and old, diversity in families, and stressful life events.
The final section, &quot;Home and Community Awareness,&quot; provides a
home safety checklist and health and social service programs that help older
adults in meeting their needs. Each lesson plan includes an introduction,
objectives, key terms, materials, procedures, and extension activities.

NOTES: 24 p.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This guide describes intergenerational programs and provides ideas
for initiating and implementing informal and formal interaction between
youth and senior adults. Intergenerational programs can help dispel negative
stereotypes that youth and older adults may have about each other. Successful
programs provide rewarding experiences for both generations and opportunities
for sharing skills, knowledge, experience, and promoting friendships between
youth and older adults. In addition, gaps in the service network of private
and public social agencies can be identified and filled through intergenerational
volunteers. This guide discusses a program development process that addresses
the following topics: (1) identification of top priority community needs
and resources; (2) identification of a program sponsor and mobilization
of volunteer resources; (3) forming a planning and advisory committee; (4)
developing a plan for the program sponsor; (5) operational considerations;
(6) types of projects (youth initiated, older-person initiated, and joint
youth and older-person initiated; (7) project evaluation; and (8) recommendations
for planning effective intergenerational programs. Also provided are suggestions
for working with senior adults and involving minorities in developing programs
for the elderly. A 25-item bibliography on intergenerational relations is
included. (ERIC--ED 349138)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This report provides information on the content, impact, and characteristics
of over 50 model intergenerational programs across the United States. It
is organized along a continuum starting with programs involving the most
physically capable and mobile persons and moving toward those in which the
older person is in increasing need of support and service. The report provides
(1) ideas for types of intergenerational programs that might be appropriate
responses to local needs, (2) models of sound practice, (3) information
about individuals, organizations, and clearinghouses that provide expertise
in special program areas, and (4) resources on program development. Programs
in the first section describe complementary ways in which the need for suitable
child care has been met by older persons needing stimulation, social contact,
and/or added income. Fifteen programs incorporating intergenerational programs
into elementary, secondary, and higher education are described in the second
and third sections. The fourth section focuses on the supportive role played
by many older persons in their relationships with children and youths who
are &quot;vulnerable&quot; (e.g., abused and/or neglected children, juvenile
delinquents, and runaways). Subsequent sections describe programs involving
older persons in political action and community planning; arts, humanities,
and enrichment; home sharing; grandparenting; chore services and employment;
and informal family and community supports. A final section on the role
of state units on aging in stimulating and promoting intergenerational programs
is followed by an index of projects by title. (ERIC--ED 252481)<BR>

TITLE: Intergenerational Dialogues: A Tested Educational Program For Children.<BR>
AVAIL.: Educational Gerontology v7 pp. 383-396; 1981.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Children's attitudes about growing old and about the elderly themselves
are in large part influence by negative images projected by the media and
through lack of actual experience in interacting with older people. To counter
this situation and to provide an opportunity for positive attitude shift,
an educational program has been developed by 10- and 11-year-old students.
Growing Up-Growing Older is a developed unit of instruction relying on a
package of software including filsm and printed support materials. A strong
experiential component is provided through structured intergenerational
dialogues, facilitated by visiting older volunteers. The program was field
tested using both a treatment and control population. Survey methodology
was used to determine pre- and post-experience stages of attitude awareness
and understanding of the elderly. Although the study populaiton did not
demonstrate the level of negative attitude we had anticipated from the literature,
post-experience testing indicated a postive shift. More significant is the
demonstrated increase in level of awareness of aging issues and of older
persons as a result of the educational experience. Finally, the treatment
population increased significantly the percentage of old people they interacted
with outside the classroom. This increased familiarity and awareness of
the elderly can be expected to continue to produce attitudes based more
on fact than on fancy. (Authors)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This publication spotlights the success and diversity of Florida's
many intergenerational programs. It describes what intergenerational programming
is and the three community needs that intergenerational programs address.
Statistics on older persons as well as youth and families in Florida are
followed by a listing of what intergenerational programs can do. The challenge
of bringing people together to support each other, to learn, and to share
learning experiences is set forth. Eight programs that represent a sample
of some of Florida's intergenerational activities are profiled. They reflect
diversity in scope of the programming, administrative complexity, and funding
sources. Each program profile consists of some or all of these components:
name of intergenerational program, agency, address, contact person, telephone
number, program description, year program began, goals, program strengths
and weaknesses, hours of service provided per month, special events/projects,
materials developed, and comments. These programs are included: Academy
of Senior Professionals at Eckerd College, Rainbow Intergenerational Child
Care, School Mentors, My Favorite Older Person Essay Contest, Bridge Building,
Hands Across the Ages, Sunshine Singers Intergenerational Chorus, The Silver
Liners, Foster Grandparent Programs, and Rockin' Readers. Information on

ABSTRACT: This document describes the intergenerational project conducted
in the Cedar Falls Public School System (Iowa) that involved senior citizens
and youths in a learning and sharing process. The county-based extension
service supported by faculty at Iowa State University assisted in the recruitment
and training of senior citizen volunteers. Implemented intergenerational
activities include: (1) students developing interviewing skills by interviewing
three senior volunteers; (2) celebrating Black History Month by inviting
three Black senior citizens to tell students about their family histories;
and (3) learning about pioneer days by involving senior volunteers in teaching
students about whittling, candle dipping, genealogy, Indian history, Black
history, quilting, and other traditional arts and crafts. Evaluation of
the project indicated that 20 senior volunteers contributed more than 407
hours to the project. Over 600 students in grades 4-7 took part with 2,229
contact hours of teachers with students. Nine schools were involved, along
with 3 principals, and 19 teachers. Recommendations for successful replication
of this project include organizational guidelines such as creating an advisory
board and conducting meetings with school administrators; suggestions for
alternative subject-matter topics for intergenerational projects; and suggestions
for financial resources. Appendices include documents such as program announcements
and project evaluation forms. (ERIC--ED 350126)<BR>

(Seniors and Kids Involved in Learning Life's Skills). Objectives of the
intergenerational program included the following: (1) to further the work
started by the SKILLS study, (2) to offer a variety of opportunities for
helping the young and &quot;young at heart&quot; to develop new modes of
communication, (3) to offer opportunities for interaction in a learning
and helping atmosphere in a two-way relationship, (4) to develop guidelines
for a learning laboratory, (5) to increase community involvement in the
Cooperative Extension Service, (6) to enhance the spirit and mental well-being
of older adults, (7) to develop an advisory planning committee, and (8)
to identify and catalog the senior citizen organizational network within
Prince George's County. Guidelines and recommendations are given for compiling
the senior citizen network guide, contacting 4-H teenagers, contacting senior
citizens, and bringing each together for some type of activity. (The SKILLS

ABSTRACT: SerVermont is a volunteer program for high school students. The
program stresses public service in the community and is intended to teach
students the value of personal volunteer service to their local communities.
During SerVermont's first year of operation, 11 high schools were awarded
minigrants to be used in developing programs in which student volunteers
would work to improve their local communities. The following programs were
initiated: a program in which teams consisting of high school students and
a senior citizen or faculty member organized annual spring and autumn clean-ups
of senior citizens' yards and houses; a program in which special education
students took part in improving a local outdoor recreation area; a program
to clean up the community common; a seat belt education campaign; a community
service auction; a program in which high school students staged a musical
performance for local senior citizens; a project in which woodshop students
are making welcome signs for their town; a leadership forum to honor senior
citizens who have made some important contribution to their town in the
past; a student-sponsored combination art exhibit, concert, and luncheon
for senior citizens; a library aide program to help other students improve
their study and research skills; a local history presentation to help elementary
school children become familiar with their town and learn the alphabet at
the same time; an intergenerational school luncheon program; and a greeting
card and letter writing program in which students correspond with senior
citizens on special occasions. (Appendixes comprising two-thirds of the
document include miscellaneous programs memos, a sample program inventory
sheet, a list of SerVermont minigrant winners and contacts, a program announcement

Preventing Rural School Dropouts. <BR>
YEAR: 1990<BR>
AVAIL.: EDRS: ED 338470 / PC01<BR>
NOTES: 10 p. Paper presented at the Rural Education Symposium of the American
Council on Rural Education and the National Rural and Small Schools Consortium
(Tucson, AZ, March 18-22, 1990)<BR>
ABSTRACT: Texas ranks among the top 10 states for school dropouts with an
annual dropout rate of about 30%. Some dropout prevention programs are incorporating
community service components as a means to counter the alienation and low
self-esteem frequently seen among dropouts and at-risk students. Significant
adults other than school personnel provide youth with linkages to a community's
heritage and culture. The Youth Exchanging with Seniors Project (YES) is
a pilot project designed to link youth with rural elderly through community-based
service programs in 20 West Texas counties. With few human services available
in this sparsely populated area, innovative grass-roots projects must be
initiated to address the long-term care needs of aging frail elders. The
group of age 60 and over comprises 15-23% of the population in 16 of these
counties. YES proposes to organize members of 4-H and Future Homemakers
of America. The project will provide the elderly with services such as housekeeping,
yard and garden maintenance, minor home repair, grocery shopping, errands,
and pet care. Participation in the project will give youth the opportunities
to develop a better sense of self, meaningful social and community awareness,
and positive attitudes toward the elderly. Project services also will help
the frail elderly to maintain an independent living style. As a result,
the YES project may provide a model for linking at-risk youth with significant
adults through community service. (ERIC--ED 338470)<BR>

TITLE: Walkabout: An Educational Experience.<BR>
ABSTRACT: The Walkabout program is an optional senior-year educational experience
in which New York high school students can acquire the basic skills and
confidence to take charge of their lives and contribute to the world. The
year-long program is divided into 5 &quot;challenge environments&quot;:
wilderness (5 weeks); applied academics (18 weeks of health and personal
awareness, language arts, social studies, and environmental science); career
internship (9 weeks); community service (3 weeks); and final presentation
(1 week). These provide students with the opportunity to learn basic and
relevant skills, go beyond their self-perceived limitations, recognize their
option to change how they deal with others, make meaningful accomplishments,
begin to clarify career options, and earn credit toward a high school diploma.
Grading is based on an &quot;honors,&quot; &quot;credit,&quot; or &quot;no-credit&quot;
system. The state-approved program is most applicable for average to bright
students, either male or female. Interested high school juniors apply and
participants are selected for the program from among the applicants....
Parent, student, and staff reactions to the program are positive. (SB--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: A Manual of Mosquito Control Projects and Committee Assignments for
4-H and Scouts Biology Class Projects, Organized Community Service Programs,
and Individuals Interested in Environmental Management.<BR>
ABSTRACT: The mosquito control projects presented in this manual were prepared
from an educational viewpoint and are intended for use by students in 4-H
and Scouts and as a supplement to high school and college biology course
work. The major emphasis of the projects is on integrated pest management,
an approach utilizing cost-effective control methods which minimize environmental
and health risks. Projects are organized into three sections: (1) &quot;Getting
Organized Projects,&quot; which are primarily educational or recreational
and when taken collectively contribute toward reducing the numbers of mosquitoes;
(2) &quot;Control Projects,&quot; including map making, breeding site location
and plotting, and collecting and identifying flying mosquitoes; and (3)
&quot;Research Projects,&quot; fostering the development of better control
methods for local conditions by emphasizing the sampling of mosquito populations
in such a way that meaningful descriptions and predictions can be made of
the effects of control methods. (Author/JN--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: An Idea (Like a Seedling) Grows. Genesis and Development of Outdoor/Conservation
Education in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.<BR>
ABSTRACT: The document describes how outdoor education in the Bloomfield
Hills School District of Michigan can be traced to 1957, when elementary
school students participated in a resident outdoor school experience for
a week. In 1968, a committee on outdoor education was formally organized.
The committee developed a rationale and objectives for outdoor education
for the Bloomfield Hills schools. The broad objective topics which provide
the rationale are: (1) an appreciation of natural resources; (2) improved
instruction in science, language, arts, social studies; (3) development
of recreational skills in the outdoors; (4) social experience; (5) community
service; and (6) aesthetic awareness. In the document, it is noted that
the outdoor/conservation education program and facilities are essential
to this community, since the city has no public parks or recreation areas,
and the school sites must serve as neighborhood parks. Future plans relate
to youth involvement in the development of facilities, the development of
a school garden-farm program, and informing patrons of the school district
as to program progress. (AN--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Teaching Civic Identity and Civic Writing in the Information Age.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Given the increasingly multi-ethnic school population and the
lack of democratic political traditions in many students' cultural backgrounds,
new ways to educate for citizenship are essential. The paper recommends
developing multidisciplinary approaches to teaching civic identity and civic
writing. It describes how a New Jersey school district introduced civic
writing activities directly linked to local history and community issues,
combining public and individual experiences with high school student commitment.
The planning team agreed that the English, social studies, and science departments
would work cooperatively to assess student research writing. They considered:
topics that would address ways to build a sense of community within the
student body; ways to develop participatory and responsible civic behavior;
and methods of teaching skills, values, and attitudes to prepare students
for the future. The multidisciplinary themes they chose were environmental
issues, local history, and multicultural studies and global issues. Besides
completing question-driven research projects, students were encouraged to
participate in local community service projects. The article offers nine
recommendations to help transform the current research process that relies
on thesis writing into a viable question-driven design. It suggests that
combining academic discourse with community service provides the social
and political glue to enhance students' personal development with civic
responsibility. (SM--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: New Roles for Early Adolescents in Schools and Communities.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This booklet is intended to stimulate new interest in the need
of young adolescents to take on meaningful roles and to help planners and
practitioneers to translate that interest into youth participation programs.
There are three major sections. Section I examines the special needs and
characteristics of youth in the 10 to 14 age group. Discussed is how youth
participation programs can offer almost endless possibilities for meeting
the specific needs of early adolescence. The role of the adult leader in
facilitating programs is also examined. To provide ideas and examples for
those wanting to start their own youth participation programs, section II
presents five case studies: a Community Service and Career Exploration Program
in Shoreham, New York; a Peer Tutoring Program in Indianapolis, Indiana;
a GUTS (Government Understanding for Today's Students) program in Bronx,
New York; a Cooperative Science Education Program in New York City; and
a Junior Historian Club in Ahoskie, North Carolina. Implementation is the
focus of section III. Discussed are program components, practical guidelines
for starting a program, the role of the adult facilitator, and tips for
working with community resource people. Recommendations from a practitioner
are also presented. Appendices contain brief sketches of additional programs,
the addresses and contact people for the programs described in section II,
a bibliography of resources, and a listing of the publications of the National
Commission on Resources for Youth. (RM--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Building Life Options: School-Community Collaborations for Pregnancy
Prevention in the Middle Grades.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This handbook was written to encourage and assist school districts,
schools, and community-based organizations to respond to the growing need
for adolescent pregnancy prevention activities in the middle grades. It
reflects the experiences of adolescent pregnancy prevention programs across
the country, particularly those of the eight Urban Middle Schools Adolescent
Pregnancy Prevention Program projects. It describes many of the lessons
learned in these projects about appealing to at-risk youth, overcoming the
barriers to implementation, working collaboratively, and dealing with controversy.
Part 1 looks at why adolescent pregnancy prevention should take place in
the middle grades. Implications for risk prevention strategies are discussed.
Changes are looked at for meeting developmental needs in middle grades education.
Elements of an effective pregnancy prevention program are outlined, and
collaboration is discussed as a means to better meet the needs of adolescents.
Part 2 contains information about pregnancy prevention strategies, including
family life and sexuality education, postponing sexual involvement, counseling,
peer education, school-based clinics, service learning, mentoring, and multicomponent
programs. Part 3 discusses program implementation and includes information
about planning, handling controversy, promoting effective collaborations,
staff development, funding, and evaluation. Appendices include a case study,
a summary of evaluation of pregnancy prevention strategies, a summary of
statistics on teenage sexuality and pregnancy, and a list of resource organizations.

TITLE: The Mentoring of Disadvantaged Youth. ERIC/CUE Digest No. 47.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Planned mentoring programs, which purposefully link disadvantaged
youth with someone older and more experienced, have become a popular means
of providing adolescents with adult contacts, counselors, and role models.
Mentoring programs vary widely in their objectives, and in the duration,
frequency, and intensity of the planned relationship. The quality of mentoring
relationships differs enormously. Mentors help compensate for inadequate
or dysfunctional socialization or give psychological support for new attitudes
and behaviors, while they at the same time create opportunities to move
successfully in new arenas of education, work, and social life. Mentoring
includes both psychosocial and instrumental aspects. Successful mentoring
generally occurs when the older individual is not removed from the mentee
by a great social distance; but matching mentors and mentees of the same
social class and gender is not the only way to close social distance. Sensitive
support, timely contacts, and other appropriate resources are the key factors.
Trust is a critical aspect of the mentor-mentee relationship. It is likely
that the bonds between natural mentors and mentees are stronger. Planned
mentoring is a modest intervention: its power to substitute for missing
adults in the lives of youth is limited. Nor can it serve all who need it.
Still, it can improve the social chances of some adolescents by leading
them to new resources and providing them with much-needed support. (BJV--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: The New York State Mentoring Program.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This conference address discusses New York State programs for
children and families, focusing on a mentoring program. New York State has
44 rural counties, which comprise 80% of the state's total area. Rural schools
face limited financial resources and access to services. Rural school children
are more likely to face failure than urban or suburban children because
of rural economic stress, crime, substance abuse, and parental abuse and
neglect. With 65,000 children in foster care, New York State has initiated
the following efforts to improve the lives of children: (1) New York's Family
Album compiles photographs and a profile of children available for adoption;
(2) the Pre- and Postnatal Parenting Education Hospital Program provides
parent education in every New York State Hospital with a maternity unit;
(3) the Nutrition for Life curriculum for K-12th grade is free to every
school in the State; and (4) the New York State Mentoring Program is a school-based
program aimed at preventing school drop out. The mentoring program links
at-risk children with caring, responsible adult volunteers from businesses
and organizations. These volunteers help children with school work, personal
problems, and development of self-esteem and self-confidence so that they
can stay in school and reach their full potential. Mentors make a 1-year
commitment to spend about 4 hours a month with a child. Technical assistance
is available to help schools locate, screen, and train mentors. (KS--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Partners in Growth: Elder Mentors and At-Risk Youth.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This study examines the relationships developed between elder
mentors and at-risk youth in the following exemplary intergenerational programs:
(1) IUE/The Work Connection (Saugus, Massachusetts); (2) Teen Moms (Portland,
Maine); (3) School Volunteers for Boston (Massachusetts); (4) Teenage Parent
Alternative Program (Lincoln Park, Michigan); and (5) Teaching-Learning
Communities (TLC) Mentors Program (Ann Arbor, Michigan). Information was
obtained from site visits, a conference, interviews with professionals in
the field of adolescent development, a review of the literature on adolescent
institutions, and a brief review of intergenerational programming. Summary
findings include the following: (1) primary and secondary relationships
between elders and youth will form in programs designed for that purpose;
(2) primary relationships are characterized by attachments approximating
kinship, while secondary<BR>
relationships maintained more emotional distance; (3) both elders and youth
cited benefits from the relationships; (4) the most effective elders were
those who had not lived what would be considered &quot;successful&quot;
lives; (5) intergenerational bonds form because of shared emotional needs;
and (6) programs were most effective when elders were placed in nonprofessional
roles, given on-going support, and contact was structured. The appendices
include a directory of the programs studied, a list of reviewers and the
experts interviewed, and a topic guide used in interviewing the older people.
A 75-item list of references is also included. (FMW--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Adult/Youth Relationships Pilot Project. Initial Implementation Report.<BR>
ABSTRACT: As part of a larger study to examine the usefulness of mentoring
as an intervention serving at-risk youth, this study evaluated the implementation
of two pilot programs in Saint Louis (Missouri) and Atlanta (Georgia). Both
programs were at public agencies aiming to operate large-scale mentoring
programs to serve adjudicated youth between the ages of 12 to 17 years.
Mentor pairs were to meet for several hours each week with ongoing training
and support offered to both mentors and students. The evaluation analyzed
how and the extent to which the public agencies at the two sites were able
to implement the program model. Evaluation of the programs in their implementation
stage found that: (1) with concerted effort, modest numbers of adults can
be recruited to mentor adjudicated juveniles, although attracting adults
aged 55 years and over is more difficult; (2) mentors and youth will not
meet regularly and are not likely to develop relationships without ongoing
support of a well-structured mentoring program; (3) at residential program
sites, it is possible for juvenile justice agencies to operate well-structured
mentoring programs with a major infusion of new resources; and (4) interviews
with mentors, youth, and agency staff indicate satisfaction with mentoring
programs operated at residential facilities. Fourteen references and five
tables are included. (JB--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Linking Up: Final Report on a Mentoring Program for Youth.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This evaluation assesses Linking Up, a demonstration program investigating
the process and consequences of mentoring. The program matched seventh-
and eighth-graders with adult mentors in a small, rural junior-senior high
school and an urban junior-senior high school. Student participants were
selected to reflect the risk levels of each school's enrollment. Neither
the program nor the associated studies achieved the magnitude originally
intended because recruiting, training, and matching mentors required more
time and staff resources than planned. A process evaluation that monitored
the formation of mentoring relationships found that about half of the student/mentor
pairs were not meeting regularly because of problems with scheduling, transportation,
communication, and/or mentor expectations. The following conclusions are
reported: (1) mentors should be recruited in large groups; (2) programs
should only focus on at-risk students; (3) mentors need clear goals; (4)
the most functional mentor goal is building student competence; (5) mentors
need continuing support; (6) programs encounter the same barriers that prevent
the development of natural mentoring relationships; (7) mentoring early
adolescents needs a context other than career development or &quot;big sibling&quot;;
and (8) mentoring is worthwhile. A description of program personnel, a review
of the literature on mentoring, and a list of 38 references are appended.

ABSTRACT: Evaluates Cornell University's Linking Up mentoring program for
needy youngsters. Although the program achieved limited success, some valuable
lessons emerged, including the necessity of finding a sufficient supply
of suitable mentors, concentrating on youths in need, setting clear mentoringgoals,
focusing on competence building activities, providing continuous mentor
support, addressing time limitations, and providing an appropriate context.

TITLE: I Have a Dream in Washington, D.C. Initial Report.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This report presents an independent evaluation of E. Lang's I
Have a Dream (IHAD) model intervention for disadvantaged youth as it has
been implemented in three schools in the GreaterWashington (District of
Columbia) area. Sixty IHAD participants are randomly selected as they enter
sixth or seventh grade for higher education tuition guarantees provided
by two or three sponsors each and intervention-support services during middle
and secondary school years. Findings for this report are based on a 1-year
study of three classes and on interviews, observations, and school records
of IHAD and non-IHAD participants. The review found that the Washington
IHAD program is a promising intervention. The studygives clear evidence
that the IHAD intervention has targeted and reached highly disadvantaged
youth early enough in the participants' lives that academic and social problems
can be addressed. Interviews with participants suggest that IHAD may have
positive effects on educational aspirations and performance. The size and
generosity of the sponsors' financial commitment impresses the participants
and gives them a special connection to the world of success. However, some
services considered necessary are provided unevenly andineffectively reflecting
the informal structure of the program and the sponsors' autonomy. Statistical
data are presented in one table. A list of seven references and a discussion
of the research methodology are included. (JB--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Voluntary Services for Young Americans.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Volunteers can make significant contributions in service to children
and youth both by working on behalf of education and by augmenting the learning
that schools provide. The merger of the National School Volunteer Program
and the National Symposium on Partnerships in Education to form the National
Association of Partners in Education is seen as an important development
for voluntary activity and advocacy for youth. This presentation addresses
four major points. First, the gap between adults and young people, due in
part to changes in family structure and the inability of schools to cope
with complex problems, calls for increased intervention and initiatives
by volunteers. Second, mentoring programs can position volunteers to assist
the educational enterprise by providing tutorial, social, and personal support;
the role of caring adults is seen as increasingly important in the lives
of young people. Third, fundamental principles underlying volunteer work
with schools and young people include the notions of responsibility to the
community and &quot;interconnectedness,&quot; and voluntarism should promote
commitment to helping others, as well as academic success, as integral to
growth to maturity. Fourth, voluntarism in the schools must be expanded
to other aspects of the lives of children and youth through links to the
family and community. (AF--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Managing Mentoring Programs.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Some programs for helping at-risk youth achieve excellent results,
while others do not. One reason for program success can be proper management.
Mentoring is a promising strategy for helping at-risk youth. Planners who
want to create effective mentoring programs should look at the implementation
experiences of other youth programs. Evaluations have focused on the following
four areas, which are crucial to the success of mentoring programs, or any
youth programs: (1) service delivery systems; (2) targeting and recruitment
of young people; (3) consistent program mission and identity; and (4) a
focused operating system--leadership and staffing. That management factors
are essential to youth program successes and failures has not generally
been recognized, particularly in the area of mentoring, where enthusiasm
is frequently the guiding principle. Unless the field matures and organizes
itself, youth programs in the United States will remain marginal enterprises
on the periphery of social policy. Funders of research programs must put
professional development and training high on their agendas. They must support
research into leadership and management skills and expand support of other
research into program effectiveness. (SLD--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: A Review of Programs Involving College Students as Tutors or Mentors
in Grades K-12. Volume I.<BR>
ABSTRACT: This document comprises the first volume of a three-volume study,
mandated by the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary
School Improvement Amendments of 1988, on domestic and foreign tutoring
programs for disadvantaged elementary and secondary students that involve
college students. This volume summarizes the results of the mandated study,
which was expanded to include mentoring programs. The programs had the following
positive effects on disadvantaged students: (1) improved test scores, grades,
and overall academic performance; (2) improved motivation and attitude towards
education; (3) increased familiarity with environments other than their
own; and (4) improved self-esteem and self-confidence. The programs had
the following positive effects on college students: (1) they obtained practical
experience and improved leadership and communication skills; (2) developed
a greater commitment to community service; and (3) increased their self-esteem
and self-confidence. Positive effects were associated with programs with
the following structures: (1) defined time commitments from tutors and mentors;
(2) systematic screening of prospective tutors and mentors and matching
with younger students; (3) thorough training and monitoring of tutors and
mentors; and (4) close relations between the sponsoring colleges and participating
school systems. The following federal programs could provide assistance
to tutoring and mentoring programs: (1) Chapter 1 and 2 of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act; (2) the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary
Education; and (3) the College Work Study Program. Statistical data are
included on 16 tables. A list of 15 references is appended. (FMW--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Youth Exchanging with Seniors: Service + Education + Commitment.
Preventing Rural School Dropouts.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Texas ranks among the top 10 states for school dropouts with an
annual dropout rate of about 30%. Some dropout prevention programs are incorporating
community service components as a means to counter the alienation and low
self-esteem frequently seen among dropouts and at-risk students. Significant
adults other than school personnel provide youth with linkages to a community's
heritage and culture. The Youth Exchanging with Seniors Project (YES) is
a pilot project designed to link youth with rural elderly through community-based
service programs in 20 West Texas counties. With few human services available
in this sparsely populated area, innovative grass-roots projects must be
initiated to address the long-term care needs of aging frail elders. The
group of age 60 and over comprises 15-23% of the population in 16 of these
counties. YES proposes to organize members of 4-H and Future Homemakers
of America. The project will provide the elderly with services such as housekeeping,
yard and garden maintenance, minor home repair, grocery shopping, errands,
and pet care. Participation in the project will give youth the opportunities
to develop a better sense of self, meaningful social and community awareness,
and positive attitudes toward the elderly. Project services also will help
the frail elderly to maintain an independent living style. As a result,
the YES project may provide a model for linking at-risk youth with significant
adults through community service. (SV--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Understanding How Youth and Elders Form Relationships: A Study of
Four Linking Lifetimes Programs.<BR>
ABSTRACT: As part of a 4-year research initiative on adult/youth relationships
programs, this study assessed relationships between elders and at-risk youth
at the following four Linking Lifetimes intergenerational mentoring demonstration
sites developed by Temple University's Center for Intergenerational Learning
in Philadelphia (Pennsylvania): (1) Neighborhood Youth Association in Los
Angeles (California); (2) Metro Dade Department of Youth and Family Development
in Miami (Florida); (3) Porter Leath Children's Center in Memphis (Tennessee);
and (4) Corporation for Public Management in Springfield (Massachusetts).
Elders were 55 years old and older, and youth were 12 to 17 years old. Using
26 pairs of 1 youth and 1 elder, the study examined pair activities, the
relationship formation process, and effective and ineffective practices
in the relationships. Elders met between 4 and 10 hours a week with youth
and received stipends and reimbursements for expenses. Separate face-to-face
semistructured interviews with all subjects were conducted at two times.
Seventeen pairs were satisfying and 9 pairs were dissatisfying to the participants.
The pairs' particular activities did not determine satisfaction. Differences
existed in participants' interaction styles. Elders in satisfying relationships
allowed the content and timing of the relationships to be youth-driven.
Included are 5 tables, 33 references, and 2 appendixes describing the Linking
Lifetimes initiative and study methodology in 2 tables. (JB--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: College Students as Mentors for At-Risk Youth: A Study of Six Campus
Partners in Learning Programs. <BR>
ABSTRACT: This study examined the operating characteristics of six Campus
Partners in Learning programs, which team college and university students
as mentors with teenagers and younger youth. The project involved four separate
but closely interrelated studies: (1) an implementation study; (2) a relationship
formation study; (3) an outcomes study that investigated the benefits to
both parties in the mentor pair; and (4) a survey of college students. These
studies were conducted at Boston University (Massachusetts); Connecticut
College (New London); Georgetown University (District of Columbia); Porterville
Community College (California); West Virginia Wesleyan College (Buckhannon);
and Xavier University of Louisiana (New Orleans). Program elements included
mentor recruitment, mentor screening, mentor training, protege orientation,
matching, and mentor/protege interactions. Interviews to gauge program outcomes
found that 45 percent of the participants formed successful relationships
in which the mentors allowed the relationships to be youth-driven and took
into account the youth's preferences for social and recreational activities
before engaging them in serious discussions and academically oriented activities.
Mentors exhibited improved self-esteem, perceived scholastics competence,
and satisfaction with their social skills. Proteges were exposed to additional
social and cultural activities and their sense of control over their lives
improved. Two appendixes present data on the sites and study methodology.
Sixteen references and eight tables are included. (JB--ERIC)<BR>

<HR>TITLE: &quot;A Sense of Pride.&quot; Establishing a Foxfire Adapted
Model of Experientially Based Career Education for Handicapped Youth. Final
Report.<BR>
ABSTRACT: The progress and achievements are detailed of three sites that
implemented a modified Foxfire approach (a community-based experiential
learning model invloving students in community research, interviewing, writing,
publishing, and marketing their own magazine). Handicapped high schoolers
interviewed and photographed successful handicapped adults, and wrote articles
on service providers and community resources. The model emphasizes career
education concepts, basic skills attainment, and affective development.
Each of the four replication sites in Colorado is described in terms of
summary accomplishments, program structure (project staff, student participants,
project activities, facilities), parent participation, advisory councils,
administrative support, community support, and evaluation. A second section
reviews dissemination activities, including collaboration with colleges
to offer practica. Information on evaluation is divided into program assessment
and responsive evaluation. A concluding section describes primary conditions
(such as administrative support and appropriate instructional staffing)
that contribute to successful implementation of the model. (CL--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: New Resource: Volunteers Who Happen to Be Disabled. Special Report.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Addressed to those individuals who have responsibility for development
of volunteer programs for a variety of agencies and organizations, this
guide provides positive examples and practical suggestions to increase accessibility
to community organizations for handicapped individuals. Its intent is to
increase services to the handicapped population and to allow this group
to participate in citizens' volunteer activities. Concrete examples are
provided of changing agencies' perceptions of people with handicapping conditions.
Brief examples are included of successful volunteer efforts of disabled
people. The main portion of the booklet consists of 12 suggestions for low-cost,
practical ways to remove barriers to the full participation of disabled
individuals. They cover recruitment of disabled persons; architectural barriers;
accommodation; bathroom facilities; specific barriers faced by blind volunteers,
deaf volunteers, volunteers with speech disabilities, volunteers with learning
disabilities, emotionally disabled volunteers, and mentally retarded volunteers;
attitudinal barriers; and language barriers that reinforce myths and stereotypes.
A brief annotated guide to resources is appended. (YLB--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Project to Mainstream Gifted Handicapped Students into Selected Models
of the Executive High School Internships Program: Evaluation Report.<BR>
ABSTRACT: As a supplement to the standard in-school high school curriculum,
the Executive High School Internship Program provides experiential learning
opportunities for gifted high school students. The program focuses on management-level
field placements through which participants learn to make decisions, interact
with the world-of-work, and assume responsbility for their actions. In 1977
a pilot project was conducted to mainstream gifted handicapped students
into the on-going internship programs. Eight school districts (twelve students)
participated in the one-semester demonstration pilot. Assessment focused
on its effects on students, sponsors, coordinators and school personnel.
General program characteristics were examined to determine feasibility of
program expansion. Learner outcomes and process objectives were outlined
by program participants and formed the base of the evaluation. Pre- and
post-test instruments were used in combination with on-site visits to participating
districts. Based on evaluation results, it was concluded with the exception
of one internship the mainstreaming project was successful. Handicapped
interns were able to compete successfully with non-handicapped peers in
independent world-of-work situations. In addition, handicapped students
were able to integrate fully into the seminar setting. Only one of the site
sponsors expressed reluctance to work with a handicapped intern in the future.
Several sponsors expressed the desire to see the program extended. (BM--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Extending Experience-Based Career Education to Handicapped Students:
An Overview of the Mainstreaming Approach.<BR>
ABSTRACT: The paper discusses the appropriateness for handicapped students
of Experience-Based Career Education (EBCE), a flexible high school program
of highly individualized learning that utilizes direct experience in work
and community settings to promote growth in basic academic skills, self-reliance,
and career awareness. The need for expanded career education and education
in life skills for handicapped individuals is considered in terms of legal
requirements (particularly those of P.L. 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped
Children Act; P.L. 94-482, the Vocational Education Act Amendments of 1976;
and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) and the learning requirements
of handicapped students. EBCE's core features and the outcomes it offers
are looked at, and some of the planning needs and adaptive steps to consider
in incorporating handicapped students into ongoing EBCE programs are considered.
It is pointed out that since EBCE is already highly individualized, handicapped
students can be incorporated into the program through further extending
its capacity to meet individual student needs, without changing the overall
structure and purposes of the program. (SBH--ERIC)<BR>

TITLE: Part Time Work for High School Students.<BR>
ABSTRACT: A high school program to prepare severely handicapped students
for supported community work changed its original purpose, to develop jobs
that would provide full time support work in the community after graduation,
to include part-time possibilities. Advantages of incorporating part-time
work include eliminating boredom and providing greater mobility. On the
job taining features a total task teaching method and attention to associated
work skills. Volunteers are occasionally used in lieu of the trainer. Two-year
results indicate that part-time work is a viable alternative for students
with moderate and severe handicaps. Community acceptance has been high,
an important factor in a school and community-based effort. Tables are appended
depicting such aspects as student placements, tasks taught to students,
and associated work skills. (CL--ERIC)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Investigated prosocial behaviors (i.e., helping, sharing) of 37
nonhandicapped and handicapped adolescents in public schools. Found that
adolescents with handicaps displayed more prosocial behavior than did nonhandicapped;
however, nonhandicapped adolescents perceived themselves as engaging more
in prosocial behavior than did handicapped peers. Found that teachers of
handicapped adolescents used prosocial teaching style more than teachers
of nonhandicapped. (Author/PVV--ERIC)<BR>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<BR>
Participation in service activities can be a vital component to civics and
social studies education. The sources selected for this topic bibliography
are intended to aid practitioners in thinking about and developing service
activities in their classrooms, schools and communities. The first section
contains references providing background information and conceptual frameworks
useful in thinking broadly about the role of service in education and youth
development. This is followed by items which feature description of service
programs or information pertinent to program development. Finally, Section
Three has references discussing the civic and citizenship education context
surrounding any service activity. Records in each section are listed alphabetically
by author. Basic information is given pertaining to primary author(s), title,
year published, and availability. In addition, abstracts of varying length
accompany each citation to give readers an idea of what's included. 
<H3>Acquiring and Ordering Publications</H3>
<BR>
A goal of this topic bibliography is not only to provide interested practitioners
with a list of citations but to aid in making the actual sources available
in their full form for use. To this end, each record contains availability
information which should enable everyone to locate and use the item. <BR>
<BR>
In general, the easiest and least expensive way to have access to the publications
is through your local library. Even if you are not near a university research
library, most smaller libraries have interlibrary loan (ILL) agreements
at no or little cost to their patrons. The alternative to libraries is to
go through commercial document reproduction and delivery services. These
offer a convenient way to get copies of serial articles and other documents
for those willing to pay for the service. The different forms of publications
mean there are variations in how to get a copy for use. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ERIC Documents</B><BR>
The U.S. Department of Education's Educational Resources Information Center
(ERIC) collects resources in education which might not normally have a wide
area of dissemination. The ERIC Document Reproduction Service (EDRS) provides
both microfiche and paper copy reproductions of these documents. To order
you will need the ERIC Document number (ED) which can be found in the &quot;AVAIL.&quot;
field of those documents reproduced by EDRS. See the attached copy of their

NOTES: 33p. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the National Council

ABSTRACT: There are several disturbing trends in U.S. public life. Citizens
are increasingly distancing themselves from the institutions that structure
decision making in the public domain. There is a diminishing sense of community,
individuals tend not to have any personal obligation to their fellow citizens,
nor do they seem to expect any consideration from others. The behavior of
young persons show them to be both victims and manifestations of this progressive
social pathology in frightening ways. One proposal for countering this trend
is the idea of student service or community service as a feature of public
education. This paper seeks to survey existing scholarship in social psychology
and learning theory in search of research supportive of educational efforts
to promote community service. A social psychological model of action is
outlined and discussed in the interest of understanding the psychodynamics
that underlie the withdrawal from community, and its flip side, commitment
to community service. This model is related to specific goal areas appropriate
to social education, and research relevant to implementing those goal areas
in the classroom are reviewed. A proposal for integrating the goal areas
into history, geography, government, and economics courses also is advanced.

ABSTRACT: An ERIC digest considers several approaches to community study
within the social studies curriculum. Material is divided into four sections.
Following an introduction, &quot;A rationale for community study&quot; outlines
skills and concepts that can be presented through community study and presents
the rationale that community study can provide greater relevance to national
and global events. &quot;Can participation in the community improve student
motivation?&quot; argues that community studies provide valuable opportunities
for students to become involved in public life and thus develop citizenship
participation skills. Research indicating that experiential community-based
learning raises student motivation is also presented. &quot;Why aren't community-
based strategies more widely implemented?&quot; considers the following
reasons for the low implementation of community studies programs: extensive
preparation time and perceived low administrator support. &quot;How can
the community be implemented in social studies education?&quot; describes
specific strategies for integrating a community--based social study component.
Emphasis is placed on a four dimensional model of community study: using
the community as a source of content; using the community as a source of
learning experience; community service as a dimension of community study;
and using the community to enhance skill development. A list of resources
concludes the paper. (ERIC -- ED 268065)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Community service is a voluntary contribution to the commonweal
that teaches valuable lessons about the responsibilities of citizenship
in a free society. Vital services are provided through thousands of organizations
created to meet needs not otherwise provided for by government. Participation
in these community service projects help create a sense of concern for the
public good and a commitment to voluntarism so essential to the future of
the United States. Students at every level of school can participate in
these projects and thus learn many social studies skills, including data
gathering, critical thinking, and decision making. Community service programs
also teach civic participation processes and skills, including group interaction,
leadership, cooperation, and political influence. Service activities build
positive bonds between youth and the institutions of our society and strengthen
student academic performance and self-esteem. Service brings together students
from diverse ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups. Fourteen characteristics
of exemplary community service programs are cited, including the principles
that: (1) community service must meet genuine needs; (2) it must have real
consequences; and (3) it must require significant personal responsibility
and decision making. Five nationally recognized school-based programs are
given as examples of ongoing community service programs that teachers and
curriculum specialists might study. A 13-item bibliography is included.

ABSTRACT: This report from the Goal 3 Technical Planning Subgroup focuses
on three areas that have been identified as important to improving the citizenship
education of students: community service, voter registration of 18- to 20-year-olds,
and knowledge of citizenship. (The aim of Goal 3 of the National Education
Goals is that by the year 2000 <BR>
American students will have competency in various subject disciplines so
they will be prepared for responsible citizenship, further learning and
productive employment.) Within each of these three areas the report examines
the available means by which assessment of student progress can be made.
The recommendations made by the report include utilizing the National Assessment
of Educational Progress (NAEP) to collect data in each of the three areas.

ABSTRACT: The focus of citizen education has traditionally been on the institution
of government. Instead, citizenship education should emphasize the teaching
of democratic behavior and values and the practice of prosociality. Prosocial
behavior is defined as actions that are intended to aid another person without
the actor's anticipation of external reward. (ERIC -- EJ 287460)<BR>

NOTES: 45p. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Pennsylvania Educational
Research Association (Pittsburgh, PA, May 6-8, 1990). <BR>
ABSTRACT: Few researchers who study political socialization have examined
the attitudes, values, and beliefs of low ability, at- risk students. This
seems unfortunate if, as is often claimed, the goal of civic education is
to deal with all students in such a way as to motivate them to play their
part as informed and effective members of a modern democratic political
system. Because of such omissions in the data gathered by political scientists
and educational researchers, a study was designed to investigate differences
among students of different ability and grade levels on three quantitative
measures of political attitudes. Three instruments were selected to measure
concepts viewed as essential to political socialization necessary for functioning
in today's society. The concepts studied were: (1) a respect for law and
order in society as <BR>
measured by the Law Scale; (2) a belief in the equality of all individuals
and the constitutional rights of all citizens as measured by the Freedoms
Scale; and (3) an open-mindedness to the opinions of others and receptiveness
to new facts as measured by the Dogmatism Field Scale. The study suggests
that low ability, at- risk students are more dogmatic and consequently less
likely to support fundamental freedoms embodied in the Freedoms Scale and
the Bill of Rights. Social studies educators need to seek ways to increase
support of fundamental freedoms, and to explore strategies to decrease the
dogmatism or close-minded attitudes evident in many low ability and average
adolescents. Three appendices provide a description of the research instruments
used, list tables of statistical data, and present a 27-item bibliography.

ABSTRACT: This report focuses on youth service as a vital component of education
for citizenship. The following six major recommendations to encourage voluntary
student and youth services are offered: (1) creation of quality student
service opportunities as central to the fundamental educational program
of every public school, including either elective credit or graduation requirement
service, and age-appropriate curricula and instruction from kindergarten
through twelfth grade; (2) state-level encouragement of local school jurisdiction
efforts to enlist the young in serving their communities, including the
provision of sufficient financial and technical assistance to ensure high
quality programs; (3) financial support from business, local foundations,
city and state resources, and organizations whose constituents are served
by youth, to ensure the availability to young people of the maturing effects
of service to others and the use of diverse methods to achieve this goal;
(4) unification of youth service organizations into a nationwide service
federation; (5) support for federal financial assistance to launch youth
service programs, with emphasis on meeting state and local needs; and (6)
revitalization of existing national service programs and serious consideration
of a National Youth Conservation Corps. (ERIC -- ED 325569)<BR>

NOTES: 14p.<BR>
ABSTRACT: Given the increasingly multi-ethnic school population and the
lack of democratic political traditions in many students' cultural backgrounds,
new ways to educate for citizenship are essential. The paper recommends
developing multidisciplinary approaches to teaching civic identity and civic
writing. It describes how a New Jersey school district introduced civic
writing activities directly linked to local history and community issues,
combining public and individual experiences with high school student commitment.
The planning team agreed that the English, social studies, and science departments
would work cooperatively to assess student research writing. They considered:
topics that would address ways to build a sense of community within the
student body; ways to develop participatory and responsible civic behavior;
and methods of teaching skills, values, and attitudes to prepare students
for the future. The multidisciplinary themes they chose were environmental
issues, local history, and multicultural studies and global issues. Besides
completing question-driven research projects, students were encouraged to
participate in local community service projects. The article offers nine
recommendations to help transform the current research process that relies
on thesis writing into a viable question-driven design. It suggests that
combining academic discourse with community service provides the social
and political glue to enhance students' personal development with civic
responsibility. (ERIC -- ED 348340)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This booklet examines the theory and practice of projects that
involve secondary students in community services. Through such involvement,
young people will develop positive attitudes toward community participation
that will persist throughout their adult lives. Community service projects
represent an important and exciting way to bring democracy to life for young
people and to demonstrate to them that they can solve problems and make
vital contributions to improving the quality of life in their communities.
The booklet begins by discussing the place of community service in the school
program. The rationale and objectives of a school citizenship program and
criteria for community service projects are discussed. Some existing community
projects involving secondary students are then described. Practical matters
involved in developing community service programs are discussed. These include
identifying community needs, defining personnel roles, scheduling and time
considerations, financial considerations, and project planning. The last
two sections discuss evaluation of projects and the future with regard to
community service education. The booklet concludes with a bibliography.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this one-year program is to help students develop
competencies to exert influence in public affairs. Seven competencies, such
as communication and social skills, are considered fundamental to an education
in citizenship and civic responsibility. The program could be initiated
at either the 11th or 12th grade, and includes the disciplines of English
and social studies. Team-teaching is suggested. The six components of the
program are: (1) a political-legal process course; (2) a communications
course; (3) community service internship; (4) a citizen action project;
(5) an action in literature course; (6) and a public message course. Field
work, a vital part of the program, includes working for political candidates
and for community organizations. Detailed explanations of the six components,
evaluation methods, and techniques for winning community support are outlined
in separate chapters. Addresses of publishers and distributors of relevant
materials are listed in the appendix. (ERIC -- ED 142448)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This publication for Pennsylvania educators outlines five homelessness
curricula found in schools in Florida, Minnesota, New York, and Pennsylvania,
which aim to sensitize students to the realities of homelessness. The report
points out that although the curricula differ in many ways, each covers
the following key topics: (1) the causes and effects of homelessness; (2)
what it is like to be homeless; (3) dispelling dangerous myths; and (4)
government and community responses to homelessness. In addition, each curriculum
either contains or has led to community service projects. The publication
lists contact persons for each program, suggests ways that educators can
use the information presented, and reproduces sample activities and lesson
plans from three of the five curricula. A final section presents program
case studies of the five homeless curricula. The case studies of the following
curricula describe the origins of each, the age group, and setting as well
as activities and topics covered: (1) Girl Scouts of Greater Philadelphia
(Pennsylvania); (2) KIDSTART: Kids Can Care! in Largo (Florida); (3) Teaching
About Homelessness in Westchester County (New York); (4) Salisbury Township
School District in Allentown (Pennsylvania); and (5) St. Thomas Academy
in Mendota (Minnesota). A resource list includes the addresses and telephone
numbers of 5 national organizations and 4 Pennsylvania organizations, the
titles of 7 audiovisual aids, an 11-item bibliography, and the titles of
4 publications and manuals. (ERIC -- ED 343969)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Giving students a sense of efficacy in the political process is
one of the most important functions of social studies education. In order
to enable students to assume the responsibilities of fully functioning citizens,
it is important for social studies educators to encourage and foster political
participation among students as part of the curriculum. This paper is the
product of a literature review of school-based community service programs
and a survey of individual state programs involving student participation
in the community in which questionnaires were sent to all states. About
250 responses were received from state departments of education, school
districts, social studies supervisors, individual teachers, and private
non-profit organizations. This handbook is intended as a guide to others
who are interested in developing and implementing their own programs involving
student participation in the community. (Sample application, evaluation,
and activity forms are appended). (Author)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Seven authors contributed to a bulletin about using community
studies to teach about the interrelationship of the local community with
larger economic and social systems. &quot;Young People and Community&quot;
(R. Beery and Mark C. Schug) addresses the need for the social studies curriculum
to consider the local community, an area which is rarely covered and one
in which students are already intimately involved. &quot;Using the Local
Community to Teach About the Global Community&quot; (Robert Woyach) suggests
activities to help students understand the ties between the local community
and the world. &quot;Approaches for Teaching Community Economics&quot; (Schug)
recommends using students' experiences as workers and consumers to teach
about the local economy and larger economic issues. &quot;State History
and Community Study&quot; (Beery) emphasizes the use of case studies of
specific local and state communities. &quot;Using the Visual Arts to Interpret
the Community&quot; (Terry Zeller) suggests ways to use the visual arts
to teach about work, play, and community values. &quot;Citizenship Grounded
in Community&quot; (Beery and Robert J. Todd) recommends choosing materials
for citizenship education based on its relevance and ability to stimulate
thought. &quot;Developing Values Through Community Service&quot; (Diane
Hedin) stresses the importance of community service for adolescent moral
and social growth. (ERIC -- ED 252452)<BR>

ABSTRACT: This book argues that rather than pursuing a debate defined by
controversy over who should be taught, what should be taught, and how it
should be paid for, Americans must address education for what it is: the
well-spring of democracy in the United States. Education must emphasize
democracy as much as it does the pursuit of excellence. By doing this, young
Americans will gain an apprenticeship in liberty--one grounded in a renewed
commitment to community service. This approach is presented as a means of
providing Americans with the literacy to live in a civil society and the
competence to participate in democratic communities, while promoting excellence
in education that will maintain America's economic, technical, and political
preeminence in a rapidly changing world. It shows that education offers
the only path toward rebuilding and reinvigorating the United States, and
that this is a path that must now be followed. (ERIC -- ED 368848)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Defying &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; labels,
Communitarianism is a new social movement reflected in George Bush's endorsement
of family values and Bill Clinton's calls for community service. Communitarianism
does not uphold the individual's rights at all costs, nor impose moral solutions.
The Communitarian agenda is to personalize schooling and teach positive
values ignored by many families. (ERIC --EJ 472599)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Informed observers, from the political right to the left, believe
that citizen education requires reform. While its effects on public life
may be unclear, democratic theory insists that education is required as
a condition of democracy itself. Most often, students are given information
about the founding of the government, its structure, and due process of
law. Reformers advocate instruction concentrated on moral reasoning, public
controversy, global interdependence, and cultural pluralism. Student participation
in community service, political action, and school governance have also
been proposed. Both mainstream and reform programs have failed because (1)
citizen education receives low priority, (2) the curriculum offers inadequate
attention to issues central to democratic citizenship, and (3) reform plans
have not included teachers in the planning process. This analysis addresses
the central issues neglected in both traditional and reform programs. Three
orientations of citizenship education are discussed: cultural induction,
emancipation, and the hidden curriculum of cynical realism. Thoughtful citizens
need help dealing with the following issues: pluralism, distributive justice,
individual interests and collective responsibility, and meaningful participation.
Direct experience is necessary to motivate students and maximize retention
and transfer, and participation is also a valuable source of citizenship
knowledge. Reform initiatives should include teachers and must address those
fundamental issues of modern U.S. citizenship that are neglected in educational
programs. Education must rely on direct student experience and concentrate
on issues such as pluralism, distributive justice, and meaningful participation.

ABSTRACT: Reconceptualizes the definition of citizenship from the concept
of persons acting in rational self-interest to that of the citizen who acts
in the interest of the public good. Argues that reflective citizen participation
must be engendered through a new curricular framework. Delineates five areas
that must be considered in this curricular framework. (ERIC -- EJ 398353)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Informed and involved citizens are crucial to the functioning
of U.S. democracy, yet many people increasingly are reluctant to exercise
even the most basic responsibilities of citizenship. Participation in the
political process is disturbingly low. If this trend is to be reversed,
the country must strengthen civic values and expand the civic participation
of the next generation. This study was commissioned to examine youth understanding
of and commitment to three important aspects of citizenship in a democracy:
meeting personal responsibilities; serving the community; and participating
in the nation's political life. The study assessed young people's views
on such topics as personal values and aspirations, community service, politics,
images of the United States, concepts of citizenship, and influences on
their notions of citizenship and civic involvement. Social studies teachers
also were interviewed, on the assumption that they shoulder the major responsibility
for citizenship education in the schools. There were four major findings
of the study. First, young people cherish U.S. freedoms without understanding
what it takes to preserve them. Second, this generation is markedly less
involved and less interested in public life than previous generations. Third,
institutions with the best opportunities to teach young people citizenship--
family, school, and government--have been ineffective. And fourth, young
people themselves are asking for more ways to get involved. A four-part
appendix is included containing: a completed summary questionnaire form
from the youth and teacher surveys; an explanation of the survey methodology;
focus group materials (discussion outline and overview of the participants);
and materials related to the one-on-one interviews (questionnaires and a
profile overview of the participants). (ERIC -- ED 324253)<BR>

ABSTRACT: Students should be taught civic competence, values, and dispositions;
and skills needed for a democratic society should be acquired through formal
education. U.S. schools must teach moral and civic values consciously, yet
these values should be taught beyond civics and values clarification courses.
The narrow focus of this type of course is to make good citizens, not develop
good people; but the idea behind civic education should be that good people
will make good citizens. The ideal values to be learned include respect
for all people, belief in human dignity, concern for others, justice, fairness,
tolerance, caring, and commitment to reflective reasoning, while the good
citizen lives an ethic of obligation and service to others. This concept
of citizenship and democracy reflects the thought of John Dewey and other
contemporary theorists. The chapter titles are: (1) &quot;The State of Civic
Education Today&quot;; (2) &quot;Two Democratic Philosophical Traditions&quot;;
(3) &quot;The Moral Dimensions of Philosophical Civic Republicanism&quot;;
(4) &quot;Democracy, Citizenship, and Community Service&quot;; (5) &quot;Social
Heterogeneity and E Pluribus Unum&quot;; and (6) &quot;Civic Competence.&quot;

Principals of Good Practice for Combining <BR>
Service and Learning</CENTER>

</H5>
<HR>These Principles result from extensive consultation with more than 70
organizations interested in service and learning. Those consultations were
conducted by the National Society for Internships and Experiential Education
(NSIEE, now known as National Society for Experiential Education, NSEE).
<BR>
<BR>
In May, 1989, a small advisory group met at Wingspread to compose the preamble
and the language of the ten Principles.<BR>
<BR>
The Johnson Foundation recognizes and thanks all of those who have had a
hand in the development of these ten Principles of Good Practice For Combining
Service and Learning.<BR>
<BR>
<B>PREAMBLE</B><BR>
<BR>
We are a nation founded upon active citizenship and participation in community
life. We have always believed that individuals can and should serve.<BR>
<BR>
It is crucial that service toward the common good be combined with reflective
learning to assure that service programs of high quality can be created
and sustained over time, and to help individuals appreciate how service
can be a significant and ongoing part of life. Service, combined with learning,
adds value to each and transforms both.<BR>
<BR>
Those who serve and those who are served are thus able to develop the informed
judgment, imagination, and skills that lead to a greater capacity to contribute
to the common good.<BR>
<BR>
The Principles that follow are a statement of what we believe are essential
components of good practice. We invite you to use them in the context of
your particular needs and purposes.

<BR>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B><BR>
<BR>
The level of interest and sense of urgency in community and voluntary service
grows greater every day. In every community, programs are being designed
for participants from kindergartners to the elderly. Is there a set of guiding
principles by which service programs can be designed and by which their
effectiveness can be judged? Is there a set if ideas which have the potential
for deepening and sustaining current movements?<BR>
<BR>
The principles described on these pages reflect the grassroots experience
and the thinking of thousands of people, hundreds of programs and numerous
national organizations over the last several decades. They are offered with
the hope that current initiatives to create service programs will benefit
from a rich recent history. <BR>
<BR>
The combination of service and learning is powerful. It creates potential
benefits beyond what either service or learning can offer separately. The
frequent results of the effective interplay of service and learning are
that participants: 
<UL>
<LI>Develop a habit of critical reflection on their experiences, enabling
them to learn more throughout life, 
<LI>Are more curious and motivated to learn, 
<LI>Are able to perform better service, 
<LI>Strengthen their ethic of social and civic response, 
<LI>Feel more committed to addressing the underlying problems behind social
issues, 
<LI>Understand problems in a more complex way and can imagine alternative
solutions, 
<LI>Demonstrate more sensitivity to how decisions are made and how institutional
decisions affect people's lives, 
<LI>Learn how to work more collaboratively with other people on real problems,
<LI>Realize that their lives can make a difference. 
</UL>
<BR>
The emphasis on learning does not mean these Principles are limited in any
way to programs connected to schools. They relate to programs and policies
based in all settings -- community organizations, K-12 schools, colleges
and universities, corporations, government agencies, and research and policy
organizations. They relate to people of all ages in all walks of life.<BR>
<BR>
<B>1. An effective program engages people in responsible and challenging
actions for the common good.</B><BR>
<BR>
Participants in programs combining service and learning should engage in
tasks that they and society recognize as important. These actions should
require reaching beyond one's range of previous knowledge or experience.
active participation - not mere being a spectator or visitor - requires
accountability for one's actions, involves the right to take risks, and
gives participants the opportunity to experience the consequences of those
actions for others and for themselves. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Some Examples:</B><BR>
<BR>
College students from the United States helped create a local primary school
in Liberia; students in Ecuador work with foster and abandoned children;
students in England care for mentally and physically handicapped persons;
and in Jamaica, they work at a Human Rights Center and in literacy projects.
In each of these cases, students are matched up with professional staff
members of local agencies through the Partnership for Service-Learning,
New York City. <BR>
<BR>
A program of the Anderson YMCA/YWCA in Stockton, California, helped establish
a relationship between area university students and the local Cambodian
community. This enabled students to help respond to the needs of the Southeast
Asian community in the aftermath of a sniper who killed nearly a dozen children.
Students acted as translators, attended funeral services, and comforted
grieving families.<BR>
<BR>
At Grant High School in Los Angeles, in the Community Service Leadership
class, students assessed community needs and helped develop projects. Additional
students were recruited from the Constitutional Rights Foundation's (CRF)
Youth Community Service group on campus. A child care group initiated tutoring
in a local elementary school; a group working with the homeless organized
collection and distribution of goods, as well as serving food at homeless
shelters; an environmental committee worked on community beautification
and tree planting; a group working with senior citizens &quot;adopted grandparents&quot;
at a local convalescent home and led aerobic classes for the elderly.<BR>
<BR>
The Retiree Group of Mellon Volunteer Professionals in Pittsburgh volunteers
thousands of hours each year doing mailings, bookkeeping and conference
registration, among other things for local charities and non-profit organizations.<BR>
<BR>
Youngsters in Addison County, Vermont, know where to turn when they're in
trouble, thanks to the efforts of students and teachers at Middlebury Junior
High School. Under a SerVermont grant, the students produced a valuable
resource guide, &quot;If You're In Trouble, We're Here to Help.&quot; A
journalist came to the school to help the students learn to interview; computer
students taught their peers how to do desktop publishing, work processing,
and graphics; students interviewed local service agencies and published
the information in a booklet created especially for area middle school students.<BR>
<BR>
In the Chestnut Ridge School District in Pennsylvania, The National Honor
Society requires that members earn 20 points per year in public service
to remain in the Society. Members may choose from tutoring programs, programs
to install emergency road signs, and plotting of emergency call numbers
for homes and businesses to assist the local fire department, among other
interesting projects.<BR>
<BR>
In the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program of the Golden Triangle in Columbus,
Mississippi, high school student volunteers learn the value of service by
working with children in need of direction. Matched up with needy youngsters,
these high school students offer companionship, attitude development, self-esteem,
relationship skills, recreational activities, school adjustment, male-female
role models, and improvement in family function. <BR>
<BR>
<B>2. An effective program provides structured opportunities for people
to reflect critically on their service experience.</B><BR>
<BR>
The service experience alone does not insure that either significant learning
or effective service will occur. It is important that programs build in
structured opportunities for participants to think about their experience
and what they have learned. Through discussions with others and individual
reflection on moral questions and relevant issues, participants can develop
a better sense of social responsibility, advocacy, and active citizenship.
This reflective component allows for personal growth and is most useful
when it is intentional and continuous throughout the experience, and when
opportunity for feedback is provided. Ideally, feedback will come from those
persons being served, as well as from peers and program leaders.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some Examples:</B><BR>
<BR>
As part of &quot;Project Motivation&quot; at the YMCA of the University
of Minnesota, students are paired with 4th and 6th graders in need of &quot;big
buddies.&quot; Volunteers attend a retreat at the beginning of the program,
and meet bi-weekly throughout the school year. They are assisted by school
social workers who help them learn more about issues related to their work
as volunteer and lead them in discussions of problems and successes they
are having with their &quot;little buddies.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
At San Francisco State's Community Involvement Center, students working
with outside agencies keep journals on their community service and meet
for two hours a week in support sessions to discuss, evaluate, and solve
problems relating to their work. In other high school and college level
programs, students compile annual reports of service experiences that reflect
different themes and personal growth. City-wide conferences scheduled throughout
the year provide opportunities for high school level volunteers to exchange
ideas, interact with community representatives about pressing ideas, and
reflect on leadership, philanthropy, and service.<BR>
<BR>
Some school programs link reflection more formally with the curriculum.
In Indiana, Goshen College students are required to submit extensive journals
reporting on their international service experiences. &quot;Project Community&quot;
at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor complements field experience
with an academic program back on campus that includes reading and writing,
as well as a weekly seminar that helps students integrate their experiences
with their reading.<BR>
<BR>
As part of the Center for Service-Learning's Vermont Internship Program,
students at the University of Vermont participate in one of three courses
which provide structured reflection and articulation of learning from the
service experience. Students may earn from 1 - 18 credits and participate
in weekly or bi-weekly seminars with other students, keep journals, and
write critical essays on aspects of the service experience. One course,
the Field Studies Internship, is portable, in that it provides a service
curriculum and reading material that can be taken to a service assignment
in a foreign country or other setting outside Vermont.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3. An effective program articulates clear service and learning goals
for everyone involved.</B><BR>
<BR>
From the outset of the project, participants and service recipients alike
must have a clear sense of: (1) what is to be accomplished and (2) what
is to be learned. These service and learning goals must be agreed upon through
negotiations with all parties, and in the context of the traditions and
cultures of the local community. These goals should reflect the creative
and imaginative input of those providing the service, as well as those receiving
it. Attention to this important factor of mutuality in the service-learning
exchange protects the &quot;service&quot; from becoming patronizing charity.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some Examples:</B><BR>
<BR>
Students from Hinesburg, Vermont, in the Champlain Valley Union High School
DUO (do Unto Others) service program design a learning program with their
school supervisor and the agency in which they'll serve. This is done during
the student's interview for the service opportunity. Activities and goals
are agreed upon by all parties at that time, and are used in the evaluation
process throughout the experience.<BR>
<BR>
At-risk students in two San Antonio school districts are identified as &quot;valued
youths&quot; and trained to tutor youngsters at nearby elementary schools.
The &quot;valued youths&quot; are given training in communications skills,
child development theory, and economic opportunities. Volunteers meet their
service goals by tutoring the children; they meet their learning goals by
reinforcing their own academic skills as well as those of the younger students.
Participants in this program have also been found to be much less likely
to drop out of high school, and they cite the development of relationships
with the children as a key factor to staying in school. (Valued Youth Partnership
Program, Intercultural Development Research Association.)<BR>
<BR>
The University of Minnesota YMCA conducts informational meetings for nearly
every program and requires an interview for all program participants. Volunteers
in some programs are asked to sign learning contracts.<BR>
<BR>
Stanford University's Ravenswood Tutoring Program, serving a primarily minority
and low-income population, stipulates that tutors must make a minimum two-quarter
commitment to work with an individual student. Before beginning tutoring,
the Stanford student meets with the pupil's teacher to discuss and outline
a set of learning goals and objectives for the sessions.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Project DownEast SERVE&quot; in Lubec, Maine, works with rural low-income
community members to motivate students who have limited educational and
vocational aspirations. The learning goal of the project is to encourage
students to complete high school and further education and to move on to
satisfying careers. Students volunteer in clerical, health care, social
services, teaching, day care, and fundraising activities to help local agencies
as part of their service.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4. An effective program allows for those with needs to define those needs.</B><BR>
<BR>
The actual recipients of service, as well as the community groups and constituencies
to which they belong, must have the primary role in defining their own service
needs. Community service programs, government agencies, and private organizations
can also be helpful in defining what service tasks are needed and when and
how these tasks should be performed. This collaboration to define needs
will insure that service by participants will: (1) not take jobs from the
local community , and (2) involve tasks that will otherwise go undone.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some Examples:</B><BR>
<BR>
In a successful student-generated community service project sponsored by
SerVermont in Chester, Vermont, senior citizens were included as &quot;SerVermont
Seniors.&quot; Students were required to include a senior citizen and a
teacher on each planning team.<BR>
<BR>
The Murray State University YMCA in Murray, Kentucky, held a college day
for sixth graders. After a full day of participating in classes, recreation,
and meals, the sixth grade guests were given a needs assessment to identify
what they felt to be critical needs and issues of their peers. Together
with college student volunteers, they developed a plan for several program
activities. <BR>
<BR>
Employee volunteers in one corporation's &quot;Public Affairs Action Committee&quot;
invite speakers from local agencies to make presentations during monthly
lunch meetings to learn about service opportunities and find innovative
ways in which employee can be involved in service work.<BR>
<BR>
College students at Virginia Tech, through their YMCAesponded to a call
for assistance in the small community of Ivanhoe. During their spring break,
students helped renovate a community center. Community members provided
potluck meals, home stays, and evening social activities for the students.
Students continue to travel the 40 miles to Ivanhoe on weekends and school
holidays to be of further help. A community organizer from Ivanhoe now teaches
a course in community development at Virginia Tech.<BR>
<BR>
The Atherton YMCA in Honolulu includes both student volunteers and the developmentally
delayed teens they work with in the process of planning events and activities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>5. An effective program clarifies the responsibilities of each person
and organization involved.</B><BR>
<BR>
Several parties are potentially involved in any service and learning program:
participants (students and teachers, volunteers of all ages), commuity leaders,
service supervisors, and sponsoring organizations, as well as those individuals
and groups receiving the services. It is important to clarify roles and
responsibilities of these parties through a negotiation process as the program
is being developed. This negotiation should include identifying ad assigning
responsibility for the tasks to be done, while acknowledging the values
and principles important to all the parties involved.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some Examples:</B><BR>
<BR>
Agencies accepting students from San Francisco State's Community Involvement
Program are given written guidelines on the agencies' responsibilities to
volunteers, including the requirement for supervision and evaluation of
students. They remind the agencies that students need direct personal contact
with clients, and that there should be minimal, if any, clerical and clean-up
work. Students, in turn are given detailed requirements, including number
of hours required, the importance of keeping a journal, and the need to
attend support sessions.<BR>
<BR>
In programs sponsored by the Partnership for Service-Learning, the student,
the faculty, and agency personnel work together to achieve the goals of
service and learning. Job descriptions and schedules are defined by the
agencies. Learning is matched to the individual service experience, and
all involved provide evaluation and reflection on the value and achievements
of the learning and the service.<BR>
<BR>
The United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and New York City work together to
provide a mentorship opportunity each year for one male and one female entering
freshman from each UNCF college. The students must have demonstrated outstanding
academic and leadership potential, as well as community and school service.
A Citicorp executive volunteers as a mentor for each selected student. Mentors
are screened and assigned for four years. They help students with academic
and personal problems, summer work, and internships.<BR>
<BR>
Many community service agencies have found it useful to have clear job descriptions,
not only for staff, but also for board members, student staff, and volunteers.
Ideally, the responsibilities and expectations of the volunteers are reviewed
during early orientation sessions and periodically throughout the experience.<BR>
<BR>
Some business people and lawyers, in cooperation with a local Chicago youth
agency (The Centre, Inc.), helped a group of urban young people follow through
on their idea to organize a small storefront office supply business. Clear
divisions of responsibilities were set out for all those involved. The business
people and lawyers consulted with agency staff and advised the youth, who
actually ran the business. The young people involved gained valuable skills
and enhanced their sense of self-worth and alternatives for their futures.<BR>
<BR>
<B>6. An effective program matches service providers and service needs through
a process that recognizes changing circumstances.</B><BR>
<BR>
Because people are often changed by the service and learning experience,
effective programs must build in opportunities for continuous feedback about
the changing service needs and growing service skills of those involved.
Ideally, participation in the service partnership affects personal development
in areas such as intellect, ethics, cross-cultural understanding, empathy,
leadership, and citizenship. In effective service and learning programs,
the relationships among groups and individuals are dynamic and often create
dilemmas. Such dilemmas may lead to unintended outcomes. They can require
recognizing and dealing with differences.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some Examples:</B><BR>
<BR>
At the University of California-Berkeley's Student Volunteer Clearinghouse
(Cal Corps), a graduate student has developed software that, within two
or three minutes, can provide a list of volunteer opportunities based on
the student's interests, preferred location, schedule, and need for public
transportation. To help spread the knowledge of how to develop and use this
kind of resource, Operation Civic Serve in San Francisco funded a trip for
this student to participate in a conference with students from other campuses
in California.<BR>
<BR>
The Lee Honors College at Western Michigan University works with the local
Voluntary Action Center in identifying appropriate sites for students. To
help broaden the connections, the Collage hosted a Volunteer Opportunities
Fair involving many area service agencies.<BR>
<BR>
The Literacy Council in Bedford County, Pennsylvania is one of several programs
run by students. The students make most of the decisions, assist trainers,
apply for funding, produce television spots, do public relations, and recruit
adults to work as tutors. While this is primarily a tutoring project, only
a few of the students actually tutor due to the difficulty of daytime scheduling,
students' safety concerns, and adult embarrassment in admitting to a high
school student that they can't read.<BR>
<BR>
High school students in Los Angeles help match their interests to community
service needs through a 60-Minute Community Search Activity provided by
the Constitutional Rights Foundation. The students use the session to go
out into their communities, identify resources, assess their own abilities
and interests, and connect with agencies and businesses in need of volunteers.
<BR>
<BR>
Recognizing that initial matching of volunteer to service opportunity is
only the beginning, Partnership for Service-Learning programs incorporate
ongoing evaluations into all service experiences. These are conducted jointly
by the volunteer, the coordinating agency, and the recipients of the service
as a basis for responding to changes and reshaping the program for subsequent
participants.<BR>
<BR>
High school students in the Vermont DUO Program establish a clear understanding
of talents and skills as well as goals for the volunteer experience through
an initial meeting involving a school staff member, agency supervisor, and
the student. After the student spends three days at the site, the supervisor
is called to check on progress, and a site visit is made by the school staff
member. The student keep a written journal of the experience. Final evaluations
are written by the student, the agency supervisor, and the school staff
member.<BR>
<BR>
Hospital Auxiliary Aids in a midwestern community conduct a review after
the first two weeks of volunteer service and monthly thereafter to be certain
that the volunteer is comfortable in that position and is meeting the hospital's
service expectations. In some cases, volunteers who have been assigned to
emergency room admissions find that they would be more comfortable working
in the gift shop; after working with people in the out-patient admissions
area for several months, a volunteer may discover a gift for consoling families
and may be placed in the hospice program.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>7. An effective program expects genuine, active, and sustained organizational
commitment.</B><BR>
<BR>
In order for a program to be effective, it must have a strong, ongoing commitment
from both the sponsoring and the receiving organizations. Ideally, the commitment
will take may forms, including reference to both service and learning in
the organization's mission statement. effective programs must receive administrative
support, become line items in the organization's budget, be allocated appropriate
physical space, equipment, and transportation, and allow for scheduled release
time for participants and program leaders, In schools, the most effective
service and learning programs are linked to the curriculum and require that
the faculty become committed to combining service and learning as a valid
part of teaching.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some Examples:</B><BR>
<BR>
Corporations across the country commit thousands of hours of employee release
time each year in the United Way Loaned Executive Program. Employees are
given time away from their regular jobs to serve on area campaigns, helping
United Way raise needed funds to operate a wide range of community service
agencies.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;DUO&quot; high school program in Vermont has received full finding
from its school district for the past 17 years. An office, staff, funds
for professional growth, and transportation funds for students are included
in the school budget. Teachers, guidance counselors, and administrators
encourage students to get involved.<BR>
<BR>
Commitment to student service by the college or university president is
critical to the success of service programs on campus. Campus Compact: The
Project for Public and Community Service, is a consortium or more than 200
college and university presidents who provide leadership and visible institutional
support for service as a part of the educational experience on their many
campuses. Campus Compact, headquartered at Brown University, provides coordination
and support for a wide range of service projects and opportunities for students,
including literacy programs and mentoring. COOL (Campus Outreach Opportunity
League) promotes the creation of a &quot;Green Dean&quot; administrative
position on college campuses. Each college or university involved hires
an energetic recent graduate to organize community/voluntary service programs
for undergraduates. The positions may be funded for one to two years, or
ideally, become permanent staff positions, as they have at Carleton College
and Fordham University.<BR>
<BR>
<B>8. An effective program includes training, supervision, monitoring, support,
recognition, and evaluation to meet service and learning goals.</B><BR>
<BR>
The most effective service and learning programs are sensitive to the importance
of training, supervision, and monitoring of progress throughout the program.
This is a reciprocal responsibility and requires open communication between
those offering and those receiving the service. In partnership, sponsoring
and receiving organizations should recognize the value of service through
appropriate celebrations, awards, and public acknowledgment of individual
and group service. Planned, formalized, and ongoing evaluation of service
and learning projects should be part of every program and should involve
all participants.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some Examples:</B><BR>
<BR>
At Stanford University's Ravenswood tutoring project, tutors are required
to take a one-day training session. Staff of the Tutoring Program provide
students with support and resources to plan effective tutorials. Student
Tutor Coordinators act as liaisons between teachers and tutors in each school
Stanford's Education Department offers a 2-4 unit course in tutor training;
teachers from the Ravenswood schools lead math and reading workshops throughout
the year; on campus there is a Tutor Resource Center and a monthly newsletter
called Tutoring Times.<BR>
<BR>
International service programs of the Partnership for Service-Learning include
pre-program academic and cultural materials, a statement of expectations
of behavior and responsibility, a two-week introductory orientation to the
culture and what it means to serve, and ongoing monitoring by academic and
agency personnel. Evaluation is comprehensive and includes academic grading
for demonstrated learning. It also includes service agency reports on the
behavior and value of the student to the community.<BR>
<BR>
The United Way of Minneapolis helped to fund a longitudinal study of the
impact of the &quot;Big Buddy&quot; program on elementary school children.<BR>
<BR>
Volunteers from Walker Manufacturing Company, Racine, Wisconsin, &quot;pitched
in&quot; to help clean up the Root River. In recognition, the company provided
personalized tee shirts (&quot;Jane Pitched In&quot;) which the employee
could then wear to other corporate and voluntary functions. The event was
prominently pictured on the back cover of the company magazine, and volunteers
were recognized for their ongoing service at an annual banquet hosted by
the company president.<BR>
<BR>
Hudson High School in Ohio gives each student who contributes time to the
service program a handsome certificate. Many schools recognize service through
award ceremonies, banquets, presentations of award pins, or other celebrations.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Prompters&quot; volunteer organization at SUNY-Purchase in New York
involves some 175 community members in the process of linking the campus
and its arts programs with others in the community. After an extensive in-service
training for volunteers, community members become &quot;ambassadors&quot;
for the arts programs of the college, speaking in schools and helping expose
some 8,000 elementary and secondary school students to the arts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>9. An effective program insures that the time commitment for service
and learning is flexible, appropriate, and in the best interests of all
involved.</B><BR>
<BR>
In order to be useful to all parties involved, some service activities require
longer participation and/or a greater time commitment than others. The length
of the experience and the amount of time required are determined by the
service tasks involved and should be negotiated by all the parties. Sometimes
a program can do more harm than good if a project is abandoned after too
short a time or given too little attention. Where appropriate, a carefully
planned succession or combination of participants can provide the continuity
of service needed.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some Examples:</B><BR>
<BR>
Many successful programs arrange projects to accommodate the busy schedules
of student and professional participants. A Stanford student, for example,
whose heavy schedule made her unable to volunteer during daytime hours,
answered calls for a crisis hotline in her dorm room from midnight to 8:00
a.m.<BR>
<BR>
Members of &quot;New York Cares&quot;, a group of 600 professionals, can
only volunteer on weekends and in the evenings. The coordinator of the group
works closely with service agencies to arrange service activities that fall
within these time constraints. For example, teams of volunteers plan, fund,
and host parties on weekends for children living in homeless hotels.<BR>
<BR>
Many academic programs that link service to the curriculum design the time
commitment based on two factors: what is needed for legitimate recognition
of academic credit, and the length of service that agencies and their clients
define as necessary. In some cases, this may require the commitment of a
semester or even an entire academic year, while others may be as short as
a summer or even a couple of weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Many successful programs in high schools and colleges organize activities
to keep volunteers involved for the entire school year. They conduct retreats,
have weekly or bi-weekly meetings, and use extensive communications to keep
track of volunteers. Others recruit student volunteers on a rotating basis.
These operate on the philosophy that students should be afforded opportunities
to volunteer whenever they are ready. This gives more flexibility for program
entry and exit.<BR>
<BR>
The Mellon Volunteer Professionals (MVP) Retiree Group generally places
people in short-term projects without long-term, on-going commitments to
a specific task in order to accommodate participants' travel and lifestyle
schedules. Volunteers work on events such as intergenerational fairs, special
fundraising events, and development campaigns for local non-profit organizations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>10. An effective program is committed to program participation by and
with diverse populations.</B><BR>
<BR>
A good service and learning program promotes access and removes disincentives
and barriers to participation. Those responsible for participation in a
program should make every effort to include and make welcome persons form
differing ethnic, racial, and religious backgrounds, as well as those of
varied ages, genders, economic levels, and those with disabilities. Less
obvious, but very important, is the need for sensitivity to other barriers,
such as lack of transportation, family work and school responsibilities,
concern for personal safety, or uncertainty about one's ability to make
a contribution.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some Examples:</B><BR>
<BR>
The best school programs are designed specifically to be open to all students.
They meet students at an appropriate place where they can learn, give, and
feel of value to the community. Release time is provided (often as much
as one day a week), and transportation is available for students who do
not have access to an automobile. Students may also do projects after school,
on week-ends, or during the summer.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;City Year&quot;, a service corps program in Boston, in its original
charter, proposed to include a diverse group of participants and to have
specific recruitment efforts to create a balance of participants that reflects
the diverse population of Boston.<BR>
<BR>
A group of largely Asian and Latino students in the &quot;Learning Through
Service&quot; program in seven San Francisco area high schools perform after-school
community service in their own ethnic communities. These students, many
of whom were initially reluctant to volunteer, noted at a recent recognition
luncheon that they had come to discover, in their own words, &quot;the great
rewards of serving.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In many programs in which activities are culturally integrated, students
report that stereotypes break down and that they learn to appreciate cultural
differences, and find out that they share similar goals and values.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;Magic Me&quot; program in Baltimore links children with nursing
home residents, specifically enlisting students who are not doing well in
school. This allows both the youngsters and the elderly to &quot;serve&quot;
one another. It also makes it possible for a group of persons confined to
a nursing home, who traditionally could not engage in service, to make a
difference to society.<BR>
<BR>
Senior citizens are often among those most willing to volunteer, yet least
able because of logistical barriers. One successful literacy program provides
transportation for senior citizens to the community centers where they help
others learn to read and write.<BR>
<BR>
A high school in Steel Valley, Pennsylvania, has adopted the elderly community.
Youngsters visit with residents one-on-one at a personal care facility,
helping with arts and crafts and performing concerts. One important aspect
of the program is that it involves a wide range of students - not only those
with high academic achievement.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>A caveat is called for in the presentation of examples: Clearly, not
all examples of successful programs can be presented in this limited space.
Most of the examples included are drawn from material submitted by organizations
that participated in the creation of a set of principles developed by the
National Society for Internships and Experiential Education (NSIEE). The
early principles developed by NSIEE served as an essential starting point
for this final document. Many of the contributing organizations are oriented
toward school or educational settings, hence so are the examples. In an
effort, however, to acknowledge the broader possibilities for combining
service and learning, others have been included. Examples are meant merely
to suggest possible ways in which to implement the spirit of the Principles.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Introduction</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
School-based and community-based service-learning initiatives have much
in common, and both are served by attention to standards of good practice.
 Each desires to serve and educate young people.  Both are strengthened
by community service activities that are recognized by the community and
the youth as meaningful.  Subtle differences exist, however.  Where school-based
initiatives can benefit from intentionally linking the service experiences
of students to what they are studying in the classroom, community-based
initiatives can be strengthened by developing specific learning objectives
fitted to the mission of the sponsoring or recipient agency.  Yet, even
when these differences exist, school-based and community-based service-learning
initiatives can each be strengthened by better understanding the language,
objectives, interests, and issues faced by the other.  The presentation
of the two sets of standards together helps identify areas of significant
overlap and subtle divergence, and underscores the opportunities for schools
and community agencies to work together for common goals.  <BR>
<BR>
Community service is a powerful tool for youth development.  It facilitates
the transformation of a young person from a passive recipient to an active
service provider and consequently helps redefine the perception of youth
in the community from a cause of problems to a source of solutions.  When
combined with formal education (school-based) and/or when thoughtfully organized
to provide concrete opportunities for youth to acquire knowledge and skills
and to make a positive contribution (community-based) service becomes a
method of learning or &quot;service-learning.&quot;  Service-learning enables
teachers and youth development professionals to employ a variety of effective
teaching strategies that emphasize youth-centered, interactive, experiential
education.  Service-learning integrates curricular concepts with &quot;real-life&quot;
situations and empowers youth to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize these
concepts through practical problem-solving, often in service to the community.
 <BR>
<BR>
Service-learning connects young people to their community, placing them
in challenging situations where they associate with adults and accumulate
experiences that can strengthen traditional academic studies.  Service-learning
also makes classroom study relevant, as young people apply their skills
in the world beyond the school's walls with work in math, social studies,
language arts, and science.    <BR>
<BR>
Service activities provide an opportunity for youth and adults to work together
in solving community problems and improving the quality of life.  In the
process of working toward common goals, youth and adults engage in meaningful
dialogue and develop trust and respect for each other.  They recognize both
have needed skills and knowledge to contribute to society.  Awareness and
acceptance of significant roles for youth in the community are powerful
forces in dispelling the sense of isolation and alienation so many young
people suffer today.   <BR>
<BR>
Although the terms &quot;service-learning&quot; and &quot;community service&quot;
are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not synonymous.  Community
service can be, and often is, a powerful experience for young people, but
community service ripens to service-learning when there is a deliberate
and explicit connection made between service and learning opportunities
which are then accompanied by conscious and thoughtful occasions to prepare
for and reflect on the service experience.  <BR>
<BR>
Effective service-learning responds to the needs of the community as well
as to the developmental and learning needs of youth.  Duration of the service
role, type of service, desired outcomes, and the structure for reflection
must all be designed to be age-appropriate.  Service-learning is most effective
when it combines community needs and youth's interests and is compatible
with their skills and abilities.  <BR>
<BR>
The following standards of service-learning are not a list of absolutes
or even a complete inventory of the elements that contribute to high quality.
 In developing these standards, recognition was given to the wide diversity
of regions, populations, communities, and programs they will embrace.  They
are designed to be broad-reaching in their scope, yet concrete enough to
be translated into action as a measure of success in the use of service-learning.<BR>

<BR>
<HR>
<H4>I. Effective service-learning efforts strengthen service and academic
learning.  </H4>
<BR>
Service-learning efforts should begin with clearly articulated learning
goals, to be achieved through structured preparation and reflection -- discussion,
writing, reading, observation -- and the service itself.  Learning goals
-- knowledge, skills, attitudes -- must be compatible with the developmental
level of the young person.  <BR>
<BR>
The examples that follow demonstrate that service can be linked to academics
in many ways and at all grade levels.  Even in the primary grades (school-based)
and/or their earliest years (community-based), when the youngest children
are learning about their own school or neighborhood, they can engage in
conservation or recycling projects.  Children in elementary school might
plan safe routes for the walk to and from school to by applying mathematics,
observation and map skills.  In secondary school (school-based) and/or when
they are older (community-based), adolescents can explore issues such as
hunger through virtually every academic discipline: crop rotation and rainfall
in science and geography, computing individual and collective nutritional
needs in mathematics, the economics of food distribution and efforts of
governments to address these problems in social studies, and so on.  Service
at a food distribution center could reinforce all this learning by placing
it in the context of community needs.  <BR>
<H4>II.  Model service-learning provides concrete opportunities for youth
to learn new skills, to think critically, and to test new roles in an environment
that encourages risk-taking and rewards competence.  </H4>
<BR>
The experience of serving in the community, however laudable, is not an
end in itself.  By performing meaningful work, young people can develop
and apply new skills, try on different roles, and plan -- constantly reinforcing
connections between academic learning and the &quot;real world.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
In making the immediate world their laboratory, service-learning has the
potential to enable students to develop increased self-reliance in real
settings.  They learn to work cooperatively and to relate to peers and adults
in new and constructive ways.  Their self-image improves in a legitimate
way, not because of imagined good feelings but rather as a result of increased
competence and positive experience.  <BR>
<BR>
Students/youth who work at a senior center learn about aging, the demographics
of community, available social services, government policy, history, and
human relations.  Those who help supervise young children at a day-care
center learn about child development, parenting, and social policy.  School
students/youth who develop a plan for school or community recycling and
investigate local services develop an understanding of the promise of recycling
as well as the challenges it poses.  In each circumstance, students/youth
learn to plan, analyze problems, and test out new and challenging roles.
 <BR>
<BR>
<H4>III.  Preparation and reflection are essential elements in service-learning.
 </H4>
<BR>
Two essential elements that give service-learning its educational integrity
and inherent quality are preparation and reflection.  Preparatory study
of the context, problems, history, and policies enriches student/youth learning
as do deliberate discussion and other classroom (school-based) or related
(community-based) activities.  Preparation also should introduce the skills
and attitudes needed for the service to be effective.  <BR>
<BR>
Reflection is the framework in which students/youth process and synthesize
the information and ideas they have gained through their entire service
experience (school and community-based) and in the classroom (school-based).
 Through the process of reflection, students/youth analyze concepts, evaluate
experiences, and form opinions -- all in the context of the school curricula
or the pre-determined learning goals of the community-based organization.
 <BR>
<BR>
Engaging in structured reflection also assists young people to gain a greater
sense of themselves.  For example, when learners are asked to think about
their own goals and progress in a service-learning experience, they have
the opportunity to master self-assessment skills that can help them to become
more independent learners.  They acquire insights that allow them to build
on their strengths and set goals in areas where they know they need further
development.  Reflection also offers teachers/youth development professionals
an opportunity to identify the knowledge students/youth have gained through
service.  The methods used can assist students/youth with portfolio development
or other assessment techniques (school-based) or self-assessment (school
or community-based).  <BR>
<H4>IV.  Youths' efforts are recognized by those served, including their
peers, the school, and the community.  </H4>
<BR>
In large and small ways during the period of service as well as with a culminating
event, students should share with the community and their peers what has
been gained and given through service.  Recognizing the work that children
and youth perform reinforces the significance of the enterprise and the
worth of the young people.  <BR>
<BR>
In a society that values work and measures people's importance by the jobs
they do, young people, especially adolescents, are perceived as non-contributing
members.  Credit for their achievements, affirmation of the skills they
have mastered, and appreciation for the time they have devoted to the community
should be acknowledged publicly.  <BR>
<BR>
This recognition can be done through the school, the school district (school-based),
youth organizations or in the community (school or community-based).  For
example, local newspapers can publicize the work done by youth, recognizing
individual achievements while increasing awareness of learning through service.
  <BR>
Whether a culminating activity is a presentation about the service, a book
of essays, pictures, a party, a picnic, or an outing, there are many forms
that end-of-project recognition may take.  Student/youth creativity and
energy should be utilized in the planning and execution of the event.  
<BR>
<H4>V.  Youth are involved in the planning. </H4>
<BR>
When young people are given the opportunity to work in after-school and
senior centers, tutor young children, or lead an effort to clean up a local
stream, they are being entrusted with important work with the expectation
that they have the ability to perform it.  Building that trust is essential
to the success of the effort.  That is why it is critical to involve young
people at the very beginning of the work.  Moreover, it provides teachers/youth
organization workers with important opportunities to encourage curiosity
and foster planning and analytical skills.  <BR>
<BR>
Instead of being told that they will be helping in the community, youth
might be asked to determine the needs of the community in which they live.
 Even if it has been concluded that there are certain sites that are open
to receiving young people, the youth might be polled to find out how they
would like to participate.  For example, if there is an interest among teachers/youth
organization workers in environmental issues, the student body/the youth
might be interviewed by a core group of student/youth information-gatherers
to find out what concerns peers have and what ideas they have for addressing
these concerns.  Teachers and advisors/youth organization workers then serve
as facilitators who make the tasks realistic and doable, but the engine
is driven by the youth, not by the adults.  <BR>
<BR>
Just as it is necessary to build consensus and support for any group effort
in the adult world, it is also necessary to gain the support of young people
in reaching out to the community.   <BR>
<H4>VI.  The service students perform makes a meaningful contribution to
the community.    </H4>
<BR>
The service roles or projects that involve students/youth in service-learning
will differ widely, depending upon the age of the young people, the needs
of the community, and the specific learning goals that have been determined.
 However, whatever the activity, the following features are shared by high
quality approaches/effective strategies:  <BR>
<UL>
  <LI>The service must be real; it must fill a recognized need in the community
or in the school (school and community-based).   
  <LI>The service activity must be developmentally appropriate.  For example,
an effort to refurbish a park could consist of the following projects: 
Younger primary students/the youngest children study plants, grow flowers
from seeds, and plant them in the park.  Older primary students/older children
research what types of birds live in the park's trees and build bird houses
or feeding stations which they continue to maintain throughout the year.
Intermediate-age students/youth extend the school's/community's recycling
program to the park -- learning about and working with city agencies to
institute it, decorating collection bins, and designing posters to increase
community awareness.  High school students for health science classes (school-based)
and older students interested in health science (community-based) design
and build an exercise path; in art class (school-based) or in art (community-based)
they create a mural for park buildings; in social studies (school-based)
or as a social action project (community-based), they survey the community
to find out what neighbors would like the park to be used for and report
their findings to the appropriate government agency.    
  <LI>The school may also be part of what makes up &quot;the community.&quot;
Agencies, alone, may not be able to absorb all the student placements, so
meaningful service can be performed at schools as well.   
  <LI>A tangible or visible outcome or product results from the service
and when possible demonstrate the learning outcomes.  
</UL>
<H4>VII.  Effective service-learning integrates systematic formative and
summative evaluation. </H4>
<BR>
All learning programs, especially relatively new ones, can benefit from
systematic evaluation.  While anecdotal evidence of a program's effectiveness
is useful, more systematic methods for assessing the impacts of service-learning
are needed, particularly since the field of service-learning is growing
rapidly and demand for in-depth understanding of program models and approaches
is high.  <BR>
<BR>
Such assessment includes detailed documentation of program components and
processes; the outcomes identified by, and expected of, all participants
(i.e., students/youth, community members, schools); and the impact of the
service-learning program on individual participants, youth organizations,
schools, and the community.  <BR>
<BR>
Assessment processes can vary in extent and complexity, depending on the
nature of the questions asked and on available time and resources.  For
example, if one question is, &quot;Do students' attitudes toward school
change (school-based) or education/learning (community-based) as a result
of involvement in service-learning?&quot; attitudinal measures can be taken
at various points, or indirect measures such as school attendance can be
used.  <BR>
<BR>
A question like, &quot;How does service-learning affect civic responsibility?&quot;
would require measures that assess components of civic responsibility such
as values, behaviors, and attitudes to be administered over an extended
period of time.  If the question is, &quot;In what ways can the experiential
learning pedagogues associated with service-learning help to bring about
education reform?&quot; then assessment methods need to focus on the relationship
between experiential teaching techniques and their multiple effects on learning
and development.  <BR>
<BR>
A major benefit of formative (ongoing) assessment is program improvement.
 Ongoing data supplies necessary information regarding program design in
relation to program purpose and pinpoints where modifications might be necessary
or desirable.  <BR>
<BR>
Summative assessment also affects program development and in addition provides
aggregate information on the overall effectiveness of a particular program
model.  A combination of formative and summative assessment, whether done
on a small or large scale, helps ensure that programs remain responsive
to their purposes and participants.  <BR>
<H4>VIII.  Service-learning connects the school or sponsoring development
organization and its community in new and positive ways.  </H4>
<BR>
Service-learning can reduce the barriers that often separate school/youth
and the larger community.  Students/youth learn that they can move beyond
their small circle of peers and take their place as contributing members
of the community as they discover that learning occurs throughout the community
in traditional and non-traditional settings -- libraries, public agencies,
parks, hospitals, etc.  Relations are enhanced as agencies, citizens, and
local government officials find that their expertise and counsel is sought
by the school (school-based); whereas learning occurs as youth-serving agencies,
citizens, citizens, and local government officials collaborate by sharing
expertise (community-based).  Through service-learning, schools and an array
of community institutions become genuine partners in the education and development
of youth.  <BR>
<BR>
Just as school administrators/youth workers have an obligation to support
the coordinated implementation of service-learning in the community, the
community must be committed to supporting service-learning in the schools
(school-based) and the educational goals of service for the young people
(community-based).  For school-based service-learning, communities must
recognize and respect the curricular goals strengthened in the schools by
service-learning.  Communities must work with the schools/youth-serving
agencies to ensure that students' service opportunities are structured to
be consistent with learner outcomes.  <BR>
<H4>IX.  Service-learning is understood and supported as an integral element
in the life of a school or sponsoring organization and its community.  </H4>
<BR>
<B>School-based</B>  In order for service-learning to be accepted and succeed
in any setting, it must receive institutional support for its philosophy
and its financial requirements.  School-based service-learning needs the
support of both district and building administrators.  Too often, educators
enthusiastic about service-learning are offered token support, largely in
words of praise for the &quot;wonderful work&quot; that is being accomplished.
 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Community-based </B> In order for service-learning to be accepted and
succeed in any setting, it must receive institutional support. Too often,
youth serving agencies enthusiastic about the results of service-learning
offer professionals token support, large in words of praise for the &quot;wonderful
work&quot; that is being accomplished.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>School-based and community-based</B>  While spoken recognition is important,
what is significant is the provision of the time that goes into exemplary
service-learning.  Teachers/youth organization workers who implement service-learning,
either as a discrete class/project, as a part of their subject area lessons,
or with thematic or interdisciplinary learning, must be supported with planning
and implementation time as well as a reasonable budget for student/youth
incentives, expenses such as transportation and training, and other outside
resources that can be crucial to the success of the effort.  <BR>
<BR>
The development, implementation, and coordination of service projects in
the community/outside the classroom require a level of support that must
extend beyond the efforts of any individual or group of teachers/youth organization
workers.  Service-learning can enhance school-community partnerships, but
to do so, it must be presented to the community in a manner that does not
conflict with community interests.  <BR>
<BR>
To ensure the stability of these school-community (school-based) and community
(community-based) partnerships, schools and school districts/youth development
organizations implementing service-learning must provide continuing and
visible oversight as well as coordination among community interests and
classroom teachers/youth organization workers.  <BR>
<BR>
Administrators should ensure that the climate of the school/organization
is open to service-learning.  Even those who are not directly involved in
service-learning should understand its significance.  <BR>
<BR>
Teachers and students/adults and youth must understand why some students/young
people have different schedules and may appear to be receiving special treatment
as a result of doing service.  The whole school/community must be aware
of the learning and service goals that enable students/youth to pursue these
goals.  <BR>
<BR>
Similarly, when there are placement sites, even those who do not have direct
contact with students/youth must understand and welcome the young people.
 Students'/youths' roles must be clearly articulated and their tasks carefully
defined with the awareness of the administration and clients of the agency
so that the work the youth perform is respected.  <BR>
<BR>
The learning and service goals must be clearly defined and understood by
all involved.  <BR>
Parents play a critical role in the service-learning equation.  At the minimum,
their permission must be obtained in order for the young people to serve.
 But they must be brought into the process at an early enough stage so that
they fully support the notion of service and the unique learning opportunities
that service provides.  <BR>
<BR>
Communication of the benefits of service and its impact on attitude toward
school or education/learning, and the relationship between work and service
should be communicated so that support from the home is forthcoming.  Service
also provides a wide variety of options for parental involvement, as students/youth
learn about the community of which their parents are adult members.  <BR>
<BR>
Parents with busy schedules might offer ideas of resources or potential
placement sites, and when appropriate, share with the students/their children
how their work and volunteer experience affect the larger community.   
<BR>
<H4>X.  Skilled adult guidance and supervision are essential to the success
of service-learning.  </H4>
<BR>
The need for service-learning is compelling, but the task of sustaining
service-learning is challenging.  Teachers/youth organization workers employing
service-learning in their classrooms must have opportunities for professional
development.  They must be given the tools, the training, and the technical
assistance necessary to implement meaningful service-learning experiences.
 <BR>
<BR>
Issues of type of service, site selection, curriculum connections, reflection,
recognition, tangible outcomes, and evaluation must be considered along
with the ever-present concerns of insurance, liability, and logistics. 
<BR>
<BR>
Learning takes place during all stages of service-learning.  Youth must
be afforded supportive supervision at placement sites.  Supervision at the
site should extend beyond the basic elements of taking attendance and keeping
track of hours worked.  <BR>
<BR>
With such rich opportunities for youth to grow, to learn about others, and
to take on responsibility, a caring person must assume responsibility for
overseeing youth activities and supporting these efforts.  <BR>
<H4>XI.  Pre-service training, orientation and staff development that include
the philosophy and methodology of service-learning best ensure that program
quality and continuity are maintained.  </H4>
<BR>
If service-learning is to assume real importance in educating students/youth
for the 21st century, it must be incorporated into preservice and inservice
training and staff development.  It will be critically important, especially
in this transitional period as service-learning begins to find a place in
the educational process, to provide high quality training.   <BR>
<BR>
Many of the teaching strategies and behaviors essential to high quality
service-learning are in sharp contrast to what has been taught in &quot;methods&quot;
courses.  It will not be enough to offer course work at educational institutions;
potential teachers/youth development professionals and volunteers should
engage in service-learning as part of their own training.    <BR>

These standards of quality for school-based service-learning were compiled
for the Alliance for Service-Learning in Education Reform by the Standards
Committee in May 1993.  They were revised in November 1994 to integrate
standards of community-based and school based service learning.  Special
