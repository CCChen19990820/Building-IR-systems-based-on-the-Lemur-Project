<html><head><title>TIA</title></head><body bgcolor="ffffff"><font size=-1>DATE:<br>March 4, 1996<br>CONTACT:<br>Dexter Koehl<br>Shawn Flaherty<br>(202) 408-2137</font><p><center><font size=+2>AMERICANS' PESSIMISM ABOUT ECONOMY NOT DAMPENING TRAVEL PLANS</font></center><p>WASHINGTON, DC--Even though a larger share of travelers expect the economy to be worse this spring than last, it has not dampened their travel plans as 25 percent of U.S. travelers plan to travel more this spring--up 2 points from last spring, according to the Travel Industry Association of America (TIA).<p>"Ironically, the pessimism travelers have about the economy does not extend to their own personal financial situations and travel plans.  The survey results reflect the uncertainty consumers felt following the budget negotiations and government furloughs, but most people probably did not feel any direct impact on their lives," explained TIA President William S. Norman.<p>Survey Details...<br><ul><li>A majority of U.S. travelers expect the nation's economy to be stable this spring, but 20 percent of travelers expect the U.S. economy to be worse (up 7 points from last spring). <li>The share of travelers who are likely to purchase a major item (i.e. car, house, household appliance, furniture) did not change much from last spring. However,  half (48%) of travelers are not at all likely to purchase a major item this spring, down 5 points from last spring. <li>Intentions of traveling for business purposes are up by 3 points from last spring (27% vs. 24%).  The share not at all likely to travel for business is down 5 points this spring (61% vs. 66%).<li>Although the overall share of travelers planning a spring pleasure trip is similar to last spring (64% vs. 65%), the share of very likely pleasure travelers fell by 4 points (44% vs. 48%).<li>Travelers plan to spend an average of 7.4 nights away on their longest pleasure or vacation trip during spring 1996, longer than the 6.9 nights averaged last spring.<li>Top travel companions continue to be spouses (59%) and children (35%).  A greater share of travelers this spring plan to travel in a group (13% vs. 6%).<li>Travelers plan to spend, on average, $1,039 on their spring 1996 pleasure trip, similar to the $1,036 last spring.<li>Plans of traveling in a recreation vehicle noted the largest increase from last spring (+7 points), followed by going to a gambling casino (+3 points).<li>Florida (39%), California (32%), and Hawaii (17%), once again, top the list of desired hot spots for spring 1996.</ul><p>TIA's quarterly Travelometer is a telephone survey conducted in late January of a representative sample of 1,500 U.S. adults.  A traveler is one person who has traveled 100 miles or more (one way) away from home in the 12 months prior to the testing period.<br><p><hr>TIA is the national, non-profit organization representing all components of the $430 billion U.S. travel industry.  TIA's mission is to promote travel to and within the U.S.<p><center><a href="http://www.travelleader.com/butbar2.map"><IMG SRC="http://www.travelleader.com/tlsbutbr.gif" ISMAP border=0 WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="78" ALIGN=bottom></a></center></body></html>

(August, 1996)‹Just when northern New England's fall foliage is winding down, Connecticut's trees continue their big burst of color.  Connecticut's long-lasting foliage season starts in late September and runs through the first three weeks in October, the result of its southern New England location and the influence of warmer, coastal air.  <p>"The 1996 foliage season in Connecticut will be a perfect one," according to Don Smith, Connecticut State Forester.  "This summer's moisture ensures that the trees have not been stressed and will peak simultaneously."  <p>Inns, antique shops and restaurants across the state are gearing up for what will probably be the most intense few weeks of visitor activity during the year.<p><font size=+1><center><a name="foilage">Foliage Regions are Unique</a></center></font><p>Only a few regions of the world have seasonal displays of color like Connecticut's, according to  Smith.  The eastern U.S. and southeastern Canada have large areas of deciduous forests, ample rainfall and favorable weather conditions for vivid fall colors.  Eastern Asia, southwestern Europe and the mountains of the western U.S. also provide viewing opportunities for bright fall colors.<p>Connecticut's geography makes it the perfect destination for lovers of fall foliage.  The many scenic roads, charming villages, rolling hills, coastline, rivers and lakes are all easily and quickly accessible from an efficient network of parkways and highways.   Whether visitors choose to view foliage by foot, bicycle, canoe or car, there is an abundance of venues to suit every preference.    <p><font size=+1><center><a name="when">When is the Peak Time to Go?</a></center></font><p>Columbus Day weekend is a good "ballpark" gauge for the peak around most of the state.  Then foliage is at its very best, primarily yellows and reds with accents of bronze, orange and purple.  <p>The State of Connecticut offers visitors daily updates on a fall foliage via its 1-800-CT-BOUND (1-800-282-6863, ext. 88) toll-free tourism hotline, commencing annually in late September.  Color peaks on various days around the state‹depending upon whether you're in the Litchfield Hills in the northwest or the coastline near Mystic in the southeast‹and summer humidity and temperatures create annual fluctuations in Mother Nature's schedule.<p>During this period, inns and b&bs across Connecticut are most heavily sought after, often well booked in advance by the leaf-peepers who make a ritual of observing the brilliant display.  The profusion of inns and b&bs enable leaf-peepers to stay in the heart of the best foliage displays, literally an acorn's throw from the color.  Accommodations can easily be booked through the hotline. <p>Callers can also request a complimentary Fall/Winter Travel Kit, which includes an accommodations directory, a "Spectacular Fall Surprises" fact sheet,  Scenic Routes State Map, and much more.  <p><font size=+1><center><a name="Free">Free Brochures Available</a></center></font><p>Available through 1-800-CT-BOUND, ext. 88,  is the brochure, Where to Pick Your Own Fruits and Vegetables, listing over 50 farms where visitors can try their hand at harvesting.  Apple picking is at its peak during foliage season, and pumpkin season follows on its heels.<p>Fall Foliage Driving Tours includes three foliage driving loops in the Hartford area, the Farmington Valley and east of the Connecticut River.  The brochure is available from the Greater Hartford Tourism District, 234 Murphy Rd., Hartford CT 06114, 860-244-8181/800-793-4480.<p>A Fall Foliage Driving Tour of North Central Connecticut is available from the tourism district of the same name. Contact North Central Tourism Bureau, 111 Hazard Ave., Enfield CT 06082, 860-763-2578/800-248-8283.  Another brochure, Fall Foliage Driving Tours,with driving loops in the Windsor area as well as in two adjacent parts of the state, New Britain and Waterbury, is  available from Central Connecticut Tourism District, One Grove St., #310, New Britain CT 06053, 860-225-3901 or Waterbury Region CVB, 21 Church St., Waterbury CT 06702, 203-597-9527.<p>The Litchfield Hills Travel Council features a 20-page illustrated brochure of eight driving loops, Auto Tours, as well as a brochure called Touring  that offers itineraries for hiker, bikers and boaters as well as drivers.  Both are available from the Council at Box 968, Litchfield CT 06759, 860-567-4506.<p><font size=+1><center><a name="Foliage Season">Foliage Season Events</a></center></font><p>Every Columbus Day weekend, the state's northeast tourism district, known as the Quiet Corner, hosts one of the state's premier foliage celebrations, the Walking Weekend.  This year's dates are Oct. 12-14.   <p>Over 50 guided itineraries for every age, interest and fitness level range from challenging treks to easy nature hikes to interpretive historic walks and night walks, covering 25 towns.  A free brochure with a detailed schedule, plus information on accommodations, dining, bike routes and antiquing is available from the Northeast Connecticut Visitors District, P.O. Box 598, Putnam CT 06260/860-928-1228.<p>Late September (Sept. 21-29 this year) is the time for the annual Bristol Mum Festival, celebrating its 35th year (860-584-4718); and the old-time, country-style Durham Fair (Sept. 27-29), celebrating its 77th year, with an average attendance of 275,000 (860-349-9495).  <p>October (5-6, 10-13) is the time for the annual Southington Apple Harvest Festival, entering its 28th year, with an average attendance of over 300,000 (203-628-8036).  The famous Chowderfest at Mystic Seaport, a festival of soups served from bubbling cauldrons, celebrates its 16th season Oct. 12-14 (860-572-5315).<p><font size=+1><center><a name="View">View By Color</a></center></font><p>Each species of tree can be identified by its fall colors.  In Connecticut, some species are in greater abundance than others.  Here's key to identifying major species:  <p>Red only: Red Oak, White Oak.  Yellow only:  Quaking Aspen, Birch,  Hickory, Norway Maple, Tulip Tree.  Red or Yellow:  Cherry, Red Maple.  Brown or Yellow:  Silver Maple.  Bronze:  Beech.  Bronze or Red:  Sugar Maple and Scarlet Oak.  Purple or Red: Dogwood.  Purple, Red or Yellow:  Ash. Purple, Red, Yellow or Orange:  Sassafras and Sumac.  <p><font size=+1><center><a name="Top">Top Viewing Spots</a></center></font><p>The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Parks and Forests, has selected eight State Parks and Forests with superb fall foliage as well as viewing towers or lookouts.<p>€ Haystack Mountain State Park, West Norfolk/Stone Tower:  From Norfolk, at the junction of Rtes. 44 and 272, take 272 north a half mile to the park entrance on the left.  The entry road leads to the parking area, and a short trail walk of 15 minutes leads to the tower, providing a 360-degree panorama of the countryside.<p>€ Macedonia Brook State Park, Warren/Cobble Mountain:  From Kent, take Rte. 341 west two miles to Macedonia.  Take the first right onto Macedonia Brook Rd. into the park, bearing left at the fork.  From the parking lot, take Cobble Mountain Trail, blazed white.  Views are from the Harlem Valley into the Taconic and Catskill Mountains.<p>€ Mohawk State Forest, Cornwall/Lookout Tower:  From Torrington, drive west on Rte. 4 for 14 miles to the park entrance, Toumey Rd., on the left.  At 'T' intersection, turn right onto Mohawk Mt. Rd.  Lookout Tower is at the end.  Scenic vistas to the north and west include the Catskill, Taconic and Berkshire ranges.  Hikers can pick up the blue-blazed Mattatuck or Mohawk Trails which cross the site.<p>€ Pachaug State Forest, Voluntown/Mt. Misery Overlook:  Forest entrance is on Rte. 49, .6 miles north of Voluntown.  Turn left into entrance and drive two miles west; bear left at fork to parking lot.  Woods access road on left leads to overlook.<p>€ Peoples State Forest, Barkhamsted/Chaugnam Lookout:  At the junction of Rtes. 318 and 181 in Pleasant Valley, travel east over the bridge and take first left onto East River Rd.  The Jessie Gerard Trailhead is 2.4 miles ahead on the right.  The yellow-blazed trail leads to two lookouts.<p>€ Shenipsit State Forest, Somers/Observation Tower:  From Somers, take Rte. 190 east for 1.25 miles to blinking yellow traffic light.  Turn right on Gulf Rd. and drive 2.25 miles to Soap Stone Mountain Rd. (it's the first right after Mountain View Rd.)  The road leads to the tower parking lot.  The blue-blazed Shenipsit Trail runs by the tower.<p>€ Sleeping Giant State Park, Hamden/Stone Tower:  Drive north on Rte. 10 from Hamden for two miles to Mt. Carmel Ave.  The park's man entrance and parking are .25 miles ahead on the left.  A gravel path from the parking lot leads 1.5 miles to Stone Tower.  A 360-degree panorama looks south at Long Island and north past Hartford.<p>€ Talcott Mountain State Park, Simsbury/Heublein Tower:  Travel three miles west from Bloomfield on Rte. 185 to entrance, just past mountain crest.

Also demonstrating travel's growing popularity, 76 percent of U.S. adults took at least one trip of 100 miles or more away from home in 1995, a profound increase from 1985 when only 63 percent reported the same.<p>Americans have a love affair with travel. It is now a staple product and for most Americans represents our nation's founding principle--freedom.  In addition, travel is affordable and easy, due to competition and sophisticated infrastructure--also results of our nation's core values, explained TIA President & CEO William S. Norman.  This love affair has created a $430 billion industry that the nation now depends upon for economic sustenance.<p>The data comes from TIA's -1995 Travel Market Report- which is based on results of TIA's National Travel Survey of 18,000 U.S. households.

The announcementof her selection came this evening during the awards banquet concludingthe Travel Industry Association of America's (TIA) annual Educational Seminarfor State Travel Officials (ESSTO), held at the Ritz-Carlton Naples, Florida.<BR><BR>The honor is unique in TIA's different awards programs. It is the one selectionmade by peers; fellow state travel directors are the individuals who castthe ballots that result in the election of the State Travel Director ofthe Year. <BR><BR>The main criterion for selection of state travel director of the year is"the obvious and measurable improvement of a state's travel and tourismprofile while under the current director's leadership." And accomplishments"should be measured in relationship to the amount of money and staffthat the director has at his/her disposal." <BR><p><B>Accomplishments Noted</B><BR>Kathleen Marks, became director of the Oklahoma Travel and Tourism Divisionin January 1990, after having served as executive director of the OklahomaCity Convention and Visitors Bureau for seven years. Since that time, shehas overseen the launch of several major travel marketing initiatives thathave boosted the state's travel and tourism industry and have earned thetourism division numerous awards. <BR><p>The most significant venture under Marks' direction, came in 1992 when Oklahomaadopted a new theme --Oklahoma. Native America.-- in order to elevate thestate's image as a travel destination and fix a state image in the mindsof travel consumers; research showed that as many as 98 percent of out-of-staterssaid that they had no image of Oklahoma. <BR><p>Since the theme was embraced and became the centerpiece of a multi-facetedmarketing campaign, advertising responses have increased 42 percent, andone study showed that the tourism division's return on investment for advertisingdollars spent increased from $22.40 in 1992 to $39.95 in 1994. <BR><p>So successful was the campaign and so popular with state residents that,in 1993, the Oklahoma State House and Senate passed legislation change thestate license plate to include the them and logo, dropping the long-standingtagline Oklahoma OK. In a concurrent move, state drivers licenses were redesignedto feature the Native America theme. <BR><p>The campaign has received recognition throughout the U.S. travel and tourismindustry, and earlier this year it was chosen as a winner in the nationalEFFIE awards competition, presented by the New York Chapter of the Americanmarketing Association. <BR><p>It was also under the direction of Marks that the state joined in promotingthe Red Earth Festival, the award-winning festival held each year that bringsrepresentatives from scores of Native American tribes from across the nationfor several days of musical presentations, art exhibits, dances and storytelling.<BR><p>The tourism division also launched a first-ever television show, DiscoverOklahoma, that features Oklahoma attractions. Over 250 episodes of the showhave been produced, airing weekly in all four in-state markets on 13 stations.<BR><p>Marks has also assumed a number of leadership positions in the U.S. traveland tourism industry, including service on the TIA Board of Directors since1992. <BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.travelleader.com/butbar2.map"><IMG SRC="http://www.travelleader.com/tlsbutbr.gif"ISMAP BORDER="0" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="78" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

In total in 1994, travel expenditures by Americans was $340 billion, making travel and tourism the nation's third largest retail industry and second largest employer.  Combined with international spending, travel and tourism represented 5.7 percent of the nation's Gross Domestic Product.<p>Analyzing U.S. domestic travel expenditures by state reveals that states and D.C. received an average of $6.65 billion each in 1994.  In total, 47 states and D.C. received more than $1 billion from U.S. travelers.<p>The top five states in terms of largest percentage changes in travel expenditures from 1993 to 1994 were: Mississippi (up 18.3% to $3 billion); Louisiana (up 14.5% to $5.6 billion); Nevada (up 12.5% to $14.5 billion); Maryland (up 10.1% to $5.4 billion); and North Carolina (up 7.8% to $8.5 billion).<p>The -1994 Impact of Travel on State Economies- can be purchased from TIA for $250 for non-members and $195 for members by calling 202-408-TIAA.<p>TIA is the national, non-profit organization representing all components of the $430 billion travel industry.

<html><head><title>TIA</title></head><body bgcolor="ffffff"><font size=-1>CONTACT:<br>Dexter Koehl<br>Shawn Flaherty<br>(202) 408-2137</font><p><center><font size=+2>Minority Travelers: A Large and Growing Market</font></center><p>(WASHINGTON, DC)--More similarities than differences exist in the way Americans travel, regardless of heritage.  That was a major finding in a first of its kind, comprehensive survey released by the Travel Industry Association of America (TIA) that examined the travel habits and patterns of the U.S.'s three largest minority groups--African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans/Pacific Islanders.<p>The intention of this report was to examine the travel habits of minority groups, so we can tailor our products and our marketing efforts to attract them. As the nation's second largest employer, better marketing means more revenue and that means more jobs.  For this reason,  minority groups are particularly important to the travel industry because they represent opportunity.  Today, ethnic groups represent 26 percent of the U.S. population.  By 2050, they will represent 47 percent, explained TIA President & CEO William S. Norman.<p>The survey examines minority travelers with reference to: travel frequency, business travel, pleasure travel, mode of transportation, hotel use, party size, spending levels, travel activities, membership in travel clubs, use of credit cards, destinations visited, and demographic characteristics. The survey compares travel patterns for each minority group with each other, with Whites, and with the total U.S. travel population.<p>Regardless of different ethnicities, travelers tend to travel similarly, but the differences are in the details and there were some important ones, Norman emphasized.<p>These commonalities existed for all travelers, regardless of heritage:  pleasure travel is the most common form of travel, and visiting family and friends is the most common reason given, followed by entertainment; a majority of -all- travelers use cars as their primary mode of transportation; the typical travel party includes two people; the typical trip involves at least one overnight stay; and shopping is the top activity--by far.  <p>Traveling households overall differ from all U.S.households, regardless of ethnic heritage.  They are morelikely to have a household head who is older, completedcollege, have a higher household income, and be married.  <p>The survey found that 64 percent ofAfrican-American households reported taking a trip in the past year, resulting in about 79 million person-trips in 1994.  Sixty-nine percent of Hispanic households took a trip in-Americans.  Seventy-seven percent of Asian-American/Pacific Islander households reported taking a trip, resulting in 11.3 million trips among these households.  Seventy-nine percent of White households reported traveling, taking approximately 992 million person-trips in 1994.<p><B>Interesting Differences...African-American Travelers</B><br>More pleasure trips African-Americans took were to visit family, friends, and relatives than the total traveling population.  Also distinguishing this group from all travelers was that this group was half as likely to be traveling for outdoor recreation purposes. Overall African-Americans were more likely to travel for business than all travelers, with an especially stronger tendency to travel for conventions and seminars specifically.  This group was also more likely to add a little vacation time to their business trip than travelers overall. African-Americans drove on the majority of the trips they took--69 percent, but less than the total traveling public which drove 76 percent of the time. However, they were four times more prone to rent a car than travelers overall.  They were equally as likely as all travelers to fly to their destination, but more likely than others to use a bus and the train.<p>On average, African-American travel parties had two people in them, but 59 percent traveled alone, much higher than travelers overall with 51 percent reporting traveling alone.  African-Americans were just as likely as the whole to be traveling with kids (21%). - Compared to travelers overall, more than twice as many trips involved group tours (10%  vs. 4%)--the highest of any individual group.  - African-Americans spent $405 per trip--slightly less than the overall average of $421.  On 10 percent of the trips taken by African-Americans, $1,000 or more was spent.- African-Americans had the highest level of participation of all groups in shopping while traveling (40% vs. 34%).  They were significantly more likely to participate in cultural events and festivals, nightlife and dancing, and gambling than travelers overall.- Top destinations for African-Americans were: Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia.-Hispanic-American Travelers- - Hispanic-American travelers were less likely than all travelers to be going to visit family and friends, but equally as likely to be traveling for outdoor recreation purposes.  - They were more likely to be traveling for business than travelers overall (23 % vs. 21%).- Hispanic-Americans were less likely than all travelers to be using a car (70% vs. 76%), but more likely than the general traveler to be going by plane (22% vs. 18%).- Hispanics were much more likely to have kids in tow--in fact the most likely of any group.- Hispanic-American travelers tended to stay longer on their trips than their fellow travelers, and they were more likely to use a hotel or motel than the average traveler. - Hispanic-Americans spent significantly more than overall travelers--averaging $559 per trip compared to $421.- Shopping was the favorite travel pastime for Hispanics.  They were more likely than others to participate in: theme and amusement parks, gambling, and nightlife and dancing.- Top destinations for Hispanics were: California, Nevada, Texas, and Florida.-Asian-American/Pacific Islanders Travelers'<p>Asian-Americans had an above average use of rental cars (8% vs. 3%).  They also were the most likely of all travelers and all travel groups to use a plane (26% vs. 18%). - They were more likely than their fellow traveler to be going solo (59% vs. 51%). - They were less likely to stay in a private home than all travelers.- Asian-Americans are the biggest spenders of all groups, including Whites ($678 per trip). On 16 percent of the trips, Asians spent $1,000 or more--the greatest share of all groups.- Shopping was Asian-American-s top travel activity. They had an above average proclivity to: participate in gambling, visit historic places and museums, play golf and tennis and ski, and visit national and state parks compared to all travelers.- Top destinations for Asian-Americans were: California and Nevada.  The 100-page -Minority Traveler Report- was based on a mail panel survey of 50,000 U.S. households.  Copies can be obtained from TIA for $100 for members and $150 for non-members.<p>TIA is the national, non-profit organization representing all components of the $430 billion travel industry.

<center><font size=+2>CHOOSE TO CRUISE WITH EVERYTHING TO DO. OR NOTHING AT ALL</font></center>
<p>
NEW YORK (March 22, 1996) -- This is a tale of Jack and Jill, aboard a cruise ship.
<p>
Jack plopped down, into the comfort of a plush deck chair under the bright sun.  He relaxed, slept, and rejuvenated himself, successfully avoiding any strenuous activity at all.
<p>
Jill, on the other hand, delighted in tumbling through her morning exercise routine, exploring exotic ports, listening to enrichment lectures before afternoon tea, and keeping up with her newly-made friends.
<p>
According to Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), this is what cruising is all about.  Shipboard life can be as simple -- or as stimulating -- as the world of Jack and Jill.
<p>
"With more than 5,400 itineraries from which to choose, a cruise vacation also runs the gamut when it comes to activities," says James G. Godsman, president of CLIA.
<p>
"Each passenger has the flexibility to take advantage of everything a cruise ship offers, whether it's extraordinary views from a comfortable deck chair, or any of a number of activities."
<p>
For some, active aboard ship may mean joining a cardiovascular workout or sunrise stretch; working out in a state-of-the-art health club; playing ping-pong or shooting a basketball; perfecting a golf swing, swimming laps or enjoying watersports off the stern.
<p>
For others, active may mean taking enrichment classes, from country line dancing and hula classes to foreign language instruction, gourmet cooking and financial investing.
<p>
The fun doesn't stop at sunset.  During the evening, passengers typically can enjoy a show, dance under the stars, gamble in the casino, listen to music or participate in a sing-along or karaoke.  Or, they can have an elegant dinner, followed by a stroll around the deck, and a good night's sleep.
<p>
And for those intent on enjoying a full day of activities while in port, shore excursions can mean everything from a hot air balloon ride over Stockholm to snorkeling off a private out-island in the Caribbean.  Still other CLIA-member cruise lines offer such sporting excursions as golf on a challenging course in St. Thomas; tennis in the Bahamas; riding horseback in Jamaica, and speed-boating on the Italian Riviera.
<p>
Children can also enjoy activities geared especially for them.  Consider that many cruise lines provide youth counselors, organized parties, relay races, trivia contests, scavenger hunts, and even a storybook character to tuck them in at night.
<p>
To find out more about the activities offered by specific cruise lines, refer to CLIA's attached "Cruise Guide for Active Adults," or contact one of the nearly 23,000 travel agencies affiliated with Cruise Lines International Association.

<center><font size=+2>THEME CRUISES OFFER UNUSUAL AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES</font></center>
<p>
NEW YORK -- Imagine anchoring off the coast of Rhode Island for the Newport Jazz Festival.  Visiting the opera halls of northern Europe and Russia, with a New York City Opera director as your guide. Whale watching 500 miles southeast of Tokyo.  
<p>
Today's cruise vacationers, searching for unusual and mind-expanding experiences in out-of-the-way places, are finding more to choose from among the cruise lines affiliated with Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the trade association for the North American cruise industry.
<p>
"Theme cruises provide more opportunities for vacationers to have fun, while immersing themselves in something they particu- larly enjoy," says CLIA president James G. Godsman.  "It gives them a chance, too, to form lasting friendships with people who share similar interests."
<p>
While some cruise lines offer talks on world affairs, art history, and mythology, others spotlight workshops on self improvement, covering everything from personal finances to personal relationships.  Still others offer lessons in gardening or painting with water colors, paired with visits to regional flower gardens.
<p>
Consider the following offerings from these CLIA-affiliated cruise lines:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Participants of the "Zooms and Blooms" cruise aboard American Hawaii Cruises' Independence will learn the secrets of extraordinary photography, visit the islands' botanical gardens and learn water color painting from an expert.
<p>
<li>Relationship-enhancing workshops titled "Cruises to Mars and Venus" are organized by author John Gray, Ph.D. (based on his best-selling Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus) aboard ships in Celebrity Cruises' fleet.
<p>
<li>Cruises with ethnic themes, like Commodore Cruise Line's Irish theme cruise, with music, food and entertainment to fit the mood; and Majesty Cruise Line's Greek, Italian, Irish and German theme cruises.
<p>
<li>Costa Cruise Lines' seven-night cruises in the Caribbean feature a special theme each night, like Roman Bacchanal, an authentic toga party at sea, and Festa Italiana, an Italian street festival with bocce ball games, pizza dough tossing contests and Venetian mask making.
<p>
<li>"Crystal Food & Wine Festivals" aboard all Crystal Cruises' Panama Canal sailings feature demonstrations and tastings conducted by guest master chefs and wine connoisseurs, and Big Band concerts in the evenings. 
<p>
<li>Every transatlantic crossing on Queen Elizabeth 2 is a themed event.  Cunard's unique "24 Reasons to Cross the Atlantic" program appeals to arts, entertainment, food and wine, golf, theater and shopping aficionados.  Themes range from "Food and Wines of France" to a "Century of Cinema."
<p>
<li>Guided tours of gardens along the lower Mississippi River, with talks by gardening experts, as part of a pair of "Gardens of the River" cruises offered by Delta Queen Steamboat Co.
<p>
<li>Music lovers will find plenty to hum along with aboard Dolphin Cruise Line, which offers big band, country western and Motown cruises.
<p>
<li>Lectures on Greek mythology and archaeology are offered aboard every Epirotiki Cruise Line Aegean cruise.
<p>
<li>Another musical extravaganza, the Pacific Coast Monterey Jazz Festival at Sea, takes place aboard Holland America Line's Rotterdam, cruising from Acapulco to Vancouver.
<p>
<li>Norwegian Cruise Line's sports cruises, always a favorite, focus on fitness, team sports and sports clinics, and feature athletes from football, hockey, basketball and baseball championship teams.
<p>
<li>Whale watching during an excursion to the semi-tropical Ogasawara Islands, 500 miles southeast of Tokyo, aboard Oceanic Cruises' Oceanic Grace.
<p>
<li>Lectures by an Egyptologist on ancient civilizations aboard Orient Lines' "Passage to Africa" cruise, which sails from Piraeus to Mombasa, and ends with a three-day Kenyan safari.
<p>
<li>Nightly themes aboard Premier Cruise Lines, with dinner music, Bon Voyage celebrations, Cantina Blast parties and Country Western Jamborees.
<p>
<li>In July, the Royal Baltic Festival enlivens a cruise through the Baltic Republics with the music of chamber orchestras in Sotckholm and St. Petersburg, while master chefs turn food to song during an October transatlantic crossing -- both aboard Radisson Seven Seas' Radisson Diamond.
<p>
<li>Regal Cruises will offer two firsts in '96:  a 12-night fall foliage cruise, with stops in Rhode Island, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island; and a 13-night repositioning cruise from New York to Tampa Bay, with stops in Colombia and Jamaica.
<p>
<li>Lectures on current world affairs, as cruisers visit intriguing ports, like Vietnam, Russia, the Ukraine and the Holy Land, aboard Royal Cruise Line.
<p>
<li>Tours of Europe's grand opera houses (in Hamburg, Stockholm, Helsinki and St. Petersburg), led by a New York City Opera director, and a performance by a quartet from the opera company, aboard Seabourn Cruise Line's Seabourn Spirit.
<p>
<li>Culinary enrichment aboard Silversea's Silver Wind and Silver Cloud hosted by Master Chefs from the famed Le Cordon Blue Culinary Academy feature cooking demonstrations, wine tastings and seminars on French table settings and l'art floral.
<p>
<li>A visit to the Land of the Maya -- aboard Sun Line Cruises -- to witness the return of spring.  Passengers visit El Castillo Pyramid in Chichen Itza during the vernal equinox (March 21) to watch a serpent of light descend the ancient pyramid.  A team of Maya experts accompanies the cruise.
<p>
<li>Self-improvement cruises -- on light cooking, wine tasting, personal relationships and romance -- to name a few, aboard Windstar Cruises.
<p>
<li>And, vacationers aboard World Explorer Cruises can consult with onboard experts, whose specialties cover the history, geology, biology, anthropology and botany of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.</ul>
<p>
"Whatever your interest... country dancing, spa therapy, football or finances... there's a cruise that focuses on it," says Godsman.
<p>
He adds that the best way to find a cruise to suit your interests, personality and budget is to visit a CLIA-affiliated travel agency, where cruise counsellors are experts in cruising.

<center><font size=+2>CRUISE INDUSTRY LAUNCHES THE NEW YEAR WITH NEW SHIPS</font></center>
<p>
NEW YORK -- The cruise industry is ship shape for 1996, with seven new vessels setting sail by year's end.
<p>
"The fleet of new vessels is creating a lot of excitement, and offers something to suit any vacationer's tastes -- from the first-time cruiser to the seasoned, repeat cruiser," says James G. Godsman, president of Cruise Lines International Association, the trade association for the North American cruise industry.
<p>
"And the technology of these ships -- from multi-level observation lounges to retractable domes over pools to theaters with revolving stages -- is truly cutting edge," says Godsman.
<p>
<b><font size=+1>Break out the bubbly</font></b>
<p>
Five CLIA-member cruise lines -- Carnival Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Costa Cruise Line and Celebrity Cruises -- will christen seven ships in 1996.  According to CLIA, 13 more ships will debut by the end of 1998.
<p>
Expect to hear about two Carnival megaships.  The first, the 2,040-passenger Inspiration, makes its debut in March, with a 
series of Panama Canal cruises.  The ship showcases such design features as a multi-deck glass-domed atrium, a double-wide promenade, expansive cabins, and health and fitness facilities.
<p>
The line's second ship, Carnival Destiny, makes its debut in November.  It measures nearly three football fields, stands 55 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty, and will carry 2,642 passengers on seven-day Caribbean cruises from Miami.
<p>
The vessel features a retractable dome over the aft pool, a three-deck high water slide, and two-deck high facilities for fitness and children.
<p>
Royal Caribbean Cruise Line will also launch two ships in 1996.  The 1,800-passenger Splendour of the Seas makes its debut in March, with 12-night European cruises.  The line's second ship, the 1,950-passenger Grandeur of the Seas, makes its debut in December with year-round seven-day cruises in the Eastern Caribbean.  A cruising speed faster than 22 knots allows for itineraries with up to four full days in port.
<p>
In May, Holland America Line launches the 1,266-passenger Veendam, with a layout similar to sister ship Maasdam.  Veendam's three-deck atrium will showcase a glass sculpture.  The vessel will sail from Fort Lauderdale to the Eastern and Western Caribbean through mid-summer, and then, for the first time, combine a fall foliage tour of New England and Canada (from New York to Montreal) with a stop in Bermuda.
<p>
Costa Cruise Line's newest and largest ship, the Costa Victoria, with a passenger capacity of 1,950, debuts in July.  The ship will sail in North America, Europe, and the Eastern and Western Caribbean.
<p>
Celebrity Cruises' newest ship is Galaxy, an 1,870-passenger luxury vessel that makes its debut in December, with seven-night cruises from Fort Lauderdale to the Eastern and Western Caribbean.
<p>
Among Galaxy's features is a multi-level observation lounge which provides panoramic ocean views in a futuristic setting.  Other shipboard offerings include a retractable "Magradome" (a sliding glass roof covering one of two pool decks), two atriums, and a four-deck foyer at ship's center.  As with its predeces- sors, the Galaxy will feature a two-deck theater with orchestra pit and revolving stage, and a two-story dining room with a grand staircase and a window wall at the stern.
<p>
In addition to building new ships, cruise lines occasionally charter ships from other cruise lines; other times, they refurbish existing ships.
<p>
In 1996, Dolphin Cruise Line adds to its fleet the newly-chartered IslandBreeze (formerly Carnival's Festivale).  In the summertime, the ship will sail on two-night cruises from New York to nowhere, and five-night cruises from New York to New England and Canada.  In the winter, the ship will sail on seven-night cruises from Montego Bay to the Panama Canal.
<p>
During refurbishment, ships are brought to new levels of comfort and design.  Cases in point this year:  Regal Cruises and Premier Cruise Line.
<p>
The Regal Empress launches the New Year with a new look, inside and out, and $3 million worth of sleek design enhancements.
<p>
Families cruising on Premier's Big Red Boat will be happy to see that their requests have been heard, and implemented -- to the tune of $1.5 million.  Frequent requests from families for more space in staterooms prompted the line to add 40 cabins with queen-size beds.  In addition, teen centers were redesigned to include state-of-the-art video, light and audio equipment for teen dances and karaoke.
<p>
<b><font size=+1>Looking to the future</font></b>
<p>
Thirteen is the lucky number for CLIA-member cruise lines, as they prepare to launch that many new ships in 1997 and 1998.
<p>
In 1997, six new ships will ply the high seas, beginning in April with Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines' Rhapsody of the Seas.  The line will launch a second ship, Enchantment of the Seas, in September.
<p>
Princess Cruises' new ship, Dawn Princess, will make its debut in May.
<p>
Three other CLIA-member cruise lines will launch ships that haven't been named yet -- Costa Cruises in June, Holland America Line in the fall, and Celebrity Cruises in November.
<p>
And in 1998, more new ships will ply the waters to round out this busy period of expansion:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Carnival Cruise Lines will launch three new ships, the first in February, the second in November and the third at an undetermined date. 
<p>
<li>Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's Vision of the Seas will debut in November, and Princess Cruises' ship, Grand Princess, will debut during the year.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<b><font size=+1>AMERICAN HAWAII CRUISES</font></b>
<p>
American Hawaii Cruises' two historic ships, the INDEPENDENCE and the CONSTITUTION, are the only remaining American-flagged ocean liners.  In 1996, the INDEPENDENCE offers seven-day cruises through the Hawaiian Islands departing Saturdays.  The cruise begins in Honolulu, Oahu and spends the first day at sea.

A wide variety of shore excursions, including new "Hawaiiana Tours and Hikes", provide passengers with a more in-depth experience of place, people and history.

American Hawaii Cruises began operating the INDEPENDENCE on Hawaii cruises in 1980.  Immediate success led to the purchase of the CONSTITUTION a year later, and its introduction into the Hawaiian Islands in 1982.
<p>
Created by the legendary American designer Henry Dreyfuss for speed, safety and comfort, the INDEPENDENCE and CONSTITUTION are considered among the finest passenger vessels ever built in the U. S.  Carrying approximately 800 passengers each, both feature spacious cabins and public areas, and plenty of open deck space.

<b><font size=+1>DELTA QUEEN STEAMBOAT CO.</font></b>
<p>
Founded in 1890 by a young river pilot, the Delta Queen Steamboat Co. is the oldest U.S. flag line.  In its second century of operating paddle wheel steamboats, the company offers overnight river cruises celebrating the music, food, heritage and history of America's heartland.  Two- to 14-night voyages depart from the river ports of New Orleans, Cincinnati, St. Louis, St. Paul, Memphis, Louisville, Pittsburgh, Nashville, Chattanooga, Little Rock, Tulsa and Galveston.
<p>
The company was founded by the Greene family, and their stewardship spanned 80 years.  In 1946, they purchased the legendary California steamboat DELTA QUEEN (c.1926), transporting it to New Orleans for service on the Mississippi River and its tributaries.  Today, the DELTA QUEEN is a National Historic Landmark and carries passengers in a style familiar to readers of Mark Twain.  The company's newer paddle wheeler, the 400-passenger MISSISSIPPI QUEEN, disguises such 20th-century amenities as a spa pool, movie theater and beauty salon behind a steamboat "gothic" decor.  
<p>
In 1995, the company added a third overnight steamboat.  The AMERICAN QUEEN promises to be the grandest paddle wheel to travel the inland rivers.  With the DELTA QUEEN, MISSISSIPPI QUEEN and AMERICAN QUEEN, Delta Queen Steamboat Co. keeps alive steamboatin' and its American spirit of adventure and discovery.

<b><font size=+1>SEABOURN CRUISE LINE</font></b>
<p>
Seabourn Cruise Line was founded in 1987 by Norwegian entrepreneur Atle Brynestad.  Its first ship, the SEABOURN PRIDE, was launched in November 1988.  From its inception, Seabourn targeted the ultra-luxury segment of the travel market with an emphasis on personal service in an elegant onboard environment found only in the world's finest hotels and resorts.  A sister ship, the SEABOURN SPIRIT, was introduced in 1989.  In January 1996, Seabourn acquired its third ship, THE QUEEN ODYSSEY.  In July 1996, the QUEEN ODYSSEY will be re-christened the SEABOURN LEGEND.  Designed and built for the sophisticated traveler, these 400-foot-long ultra-deluxe sister ships carry only 200 passengers in all-suite accommodations.
<p>
While he was convinced that Seabourn was the finest cruise product in the world, Brynestad believed the company could benefit from sales and marketing assistance of an established entity.  He explored a variety of options before reaching an agreement with Carnival Cruise Lines in 1992 to take a 25 percent interest in the company.  The agreement included the obligation to increase that holding to 50 percent once Seabourn had become profitable a second year in a row.  This occurred in fiscal 1995 and the Carnival holding has been extended.  The relationship is one of independence and interdependence; Brynestad continues as Chairman and CEO of Seabourn, while Larry Pimental serves as President.
<p>
Today, Seabourn is generally recognized as one of the most celebrated cruise lines in the world having received top awards and ratings from cruise guidebooks and other publications.  Seabourn cruises North and South America, Alaska, the Caribbean, the British Isles, Europe, Scandinavia, the Mediterranean, East Africa, Asia, the Orient and the South Pacific.

<b><font size=+1>WORLD EXPLORER</font></b>
<p>
Known for its informal atmosphere and focus on culture and adventure, World Explorer Cruises was one of the first cruise lines to ply the popular Alaska Inside Passage.  The company began service in 1978 with the UNIVERSE (formerly the ATLANTIC).  In 1995, the UNIVERSE was retired and replaced with the ENCHANTED SEAS, which is a larger and faster vessel.  The ship still provides the charm and informal environment of a classic vessel, and its increased speed will allow more flexibility for the line's extensive itinerary.
<p>
Experts are onboard each of the 14-day summer sailings to give insight on Alaska's history, wildlife and geology.  The largest library afloat -- more than 15,000 volumes -- also provides a wealth of information.  World Explorer's philosophy that a vacation should be an educational adventure to stir the heart, mind and soul, is evident in its line-up of more than 40 shore excursions and itineraries which boasts nine ports of call and provides more time in port than any other cruise line in Alaska.
<p>
During the remainder of the year, the ENCHANTED SEAS is operated by the University of Pittsburgh and the Institute for Shipboard Education as a floating university for "Semester at Sea" programs.

<center><font size=+2>CRUISING: A SINGULAR SENSATION</font></center>
<p>
NEW YORK (March 22, 1996) -- Singles are a rapidly emerging force in today's cruise market, according to Cruise Lines International Association.  A recent CLIA study notes that fully 25 percent of cruisers are single, and that there are equal numbers of men and women. 
<p>
"A cruise creates exactly the kind of atmosphere that singles are looking for and provides excellent value as well," says James G. Godsman, president of CLIA.
<p>
A look at CLIA's "Cruise Guide for Singles" chart (attached) shows that increasing numbers of cruise lines now offer reduced single supplements, some as low as 10 percent above the double occupancy rate.  Others have guaranteed share programs that carry no extra charge, or they offer cabins especially for single occupancy or feature special singles packages. 
<p>
And the shipboard social climate is an excellent way in which to meet other single passengers.  Ways in which cruise lines help singles mingle include get-together parties early in the cruise and by special seating arrangements with other singles at dinner.
<p>
Several also arrange for onboard hosts to help encourage new friendships and social networking.

"Cruise ships are more than floating resorts these days.  They're packed, from bow to stern and top to bottom, with the latest in technological advances," says James G. Godsman, president of Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the cruise industry's marketing association.
<p>
Cruise ship construction has reached new heights in design and technology.  Consider these features:
<ul>
<li>Integrated audio, video, computer and communications systems which allow passengers to plan their shipboard activities, for work or play.
<li>Conference facilities with language translation and teleconferencing equipment.
<li>An interactive golf driving range that allows passen- gers to "play" on some of the world's best-known courses.
<li>Nightclubs situated 15 decks above sea, accessible by moving, glass-enclosed walkways.
<li>Open-air public areas by day that, with the flick of a switch, become enclosed, futuristic, discos by night.
<li>Sculptures that combine waterfalls with changing fiber- optic images.
<li>The latest in digital exercise equipment, in the ship's glass-walled spa.
<li>In-cabin telephones that easily allow, with the swipe of a card, ship-to-shore calls.
</ul>
<p>
More to it than meets the eye
<p>
It's easy to overlook the behind-the-scenes features that make cruises today such pleasurable experiences.
<p>
"The high-tech nature of modern cruise ships isn't relegated only to what passengers can see -- a fair share controls what happens behind the scenes as well," says Godsman.
<p>
Consider engineering equipment powerful enough to propel a 100,000-ton vessel, advanced diesel engines that maintain a ship's speed, regardless of weather conditions, and more powerful engines that allow ships to reach destinations sooner.
<p>
"Some ships are equipped to cruise at faster speeds, which could allow up to four full days in port during a seven-day cruise," Godsman explains.
<p>
Consider also the stabilizers which virtually eliminate any rocking motion and provide for smooth sailing.
<p>
Or, advanced navigation computers which allow a vessel to check itself via satellite, and thus stay on course.  Or, computerized inventory and maintenance systems that notify crew members whenever parts, food supplies or other provisions run low.
<p>
"Even a ship's entertainment gets a boost from technology, with pre-programmed lighting cues, curtain and set changes, and revolving stages," says Godsman.
<p>

Godsman, president of Cruise Lines InternationalAssociation (CLIA). <BR><BR>Among the offerings: regular and water aerobics classes, tennis courts,volleyball and basketball games, walking and jogging tracks, swimming, treadmills,weight training, saunas, steam rooms, body wraps, massage therapists andaromatherapy. <BR><BR>Says Godsman: &quot;The experience would be similar to spending a week atan exclusive land spa, with a bonus -- in between workouts, cruisers visitfascinating ports all over the world.&quot; <BR><BR>Nearly all of the CLIA-member lines offering some combination of exerciseclasses, spas and special menus point to one product as their most outstandingfeature. <BR><BR><B>Spectacular Spas</B> <BR>For example, the Nouveau Yu Health Environment Capsule aboard Carnival CruiseLines' Ecstasy is an oval-shaped chamber for passengers to lie in. Oncein position, the guest is treated to a soothing mix of scents, sounds andsynchronized lighting. <BR><BR>The AquaSpa Program (sm), offered on all Celebrity Cruises' vessels, isinspired by Japanese gardens and bathhouses. Among the therapies on thenewer ships are Rasul, an Oriental ceremony which includes a seaweed soapshower, medicinal mud pack, herbal steam bath and massage, and a Thalassotherapypool, with the benefits of water massage. <BR><BR>Costa Cruise Line's newest ship, Costa Victoria, features products and treatmentsfrom the world-renowned health spa &quot;Terme di Saturnia,&quot; of Tuscany,Italy. Another Italian-inspired spa is the Roman Spa aboard Norwegian CruiseLine's Norway. The spa is designed to mimic an open-air scene from ancientRome. <BR><BR>Passengers sailing on Royal Olympic Cruises' Stella Solaris may choose fromseveral packages offered at the ship's new spa; one treatment is thalassotherapy,a treatment which features sea salts and aromatic essences. And aboard SeawindCruise Line, passengers have at their disposal a full-service salon offeredthrough Steiners of London. European hair, skin and body care -- includingIonithermie Slimming Treatments and Elemis Total Body Experience -- arefeatured. At Majesty Cruise Line, passengers can choose froma full slateof massage options, including reflexology, a technique which focuses onspecific points in the hands and feet to ease bodily discomfort. <BR><BR><B>Exciting Exercise Options</B> <BR>Commodore Cruise Line offers a gymnasium for passengers of the EnchantedIsle, while Crystal Cruises offers a wide range of exercise possibilitieswith a full-time sports director and fitness director, and a regulation-sizepaddle tennis Wimbledon Court. Aboard Cunard Line's Vistafjord, Golden DoorSpa-trained fitness instructors guide passengers' weight training and aerobicconditioning. <BR><BR>Passengers aboard Holland America Line's ships may take part in the Passport-to-Fitnessprogram, which awards stamps (and ultimately prizes) for every healthfulactivity completed. <BR><BR>Aboard Premier Cruise Lines' vessels, passengers are invited to take partin SeaSport's activities, which include dance, stretch and aerobics classes,and team sports including volleyball, basketball and table tennis. <BR><BR>Cruisercise is the featured program aboard Princess Cruises' vessels. Wateraerobics and walking classes are scheduled daily, and a personal traineris on hand to advise. <BR><BR>Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's ShipShape program provides passengers of allages with a variety of fitness options, among them a sunrise stretch classwhich focuses on body alignment, flexibility and relaxation. Passengersaboard Silversea Cruises have access to a fully-equipped fitness centerwith a daily roster of aerobics, yoga and toning classes, as well as separatesauna and steam rooms for men and women. <BR><BR><B>Good Eating</B> <BR>While nearly all the cruise lines offer &quot;lighter&quot; meals whichare lower in fat, sodium, cholesterol and calories, four lines point totheir offerings as their most healthful features. <BR><BR>Aboard Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, for example, passengers may choose fromlight and vegetarian selections at dinner each night. Typical entrees arePoached Fillet of Norwegian Salmon with Low-Fat Orange Yogurt Cream andVegetable Strudel. The same is true of passengers sailing with Dolphin CruiseLine and Regal Cruises. And, patrons of Majesty Cruise Line's smoke-freedining areas may select vegetarian and &quot;Light at Sea&quot; entreesat all meals; dinner features a full &quot;Light at Sea&quot; selection,from appetizer to dessert. <BR><BR>And this fall, Windstar Cruises will complement its signature &quot;180From Ordinary&quot; cuisine with a complete selection of lighter breakfast,lunch and dinner dishes. Jeanne Jones will create the new Lighter Fare,which will feature a calorically-correct appetizer, entree and dessert foreach meal. <BR><BR>To learn more about the exercise programs, spas and special menus offeredon cruise ships, contact a CLIA-affiliated travel agency near you. To findone, visit CLIA's homepage on the Internet, at (<a href="http://www.ten-io.com/clia/">http://www.ten-io.com/clia/</a>),or look for the blue, gold and white logo in local travel agents' windows.<BR><BR>September 1996 <BR><BR>NOTE TO EDITORS: Attached are two charts, one detailing onboard activitiesfor adults and the other showing which lines offer lean and &quot;light&quot;cuisine. <BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.travelleader.com/butbar2.map"><IMG SRC="http://www.travelleader.com/tlsbutbr.gif"ISMAP BORDER="0" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="78" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Orban Associates<BR>#104823<BR>(201) 605-2121</FONT> <BR><P><CENTER><FONT size=+2><B>WHERE CAN YOU GO ON A CRUISE?</B></FONT><BR>From Ashdod to Zanzibar, and (Nearly) All Points in Between </CENTER><P>In days of yore, sailors set out for ports undiscovered with little morethan a compass and some not-too-edible food. Luckily for today's cruisers,those days are long gone. <BR><BR>What isn't gone, though, is the sense of adventure that's awakened whenheaded for ports unknown. <BR><BR>From Ashdod in Israel to Zanzibar in Tanzania, and nearly all points inbetween, cruise ships are crisscrossing the globe and taking vacationersto more exotic and unusual destinations. And, with more than 1,800 portsof call worldwide, cruise vacationers are finding possibilities as diverseas the destinations themselves. <BR><BR>&quot;Have you ever thought of visiting Casablanca on a cruise? How aboutLatvia or Estonia?&quot; asks James G. Godsman, president of Cruise LinesInternational Association (CLIA). &quot;If you think you can't get thereby cruise ship, think again, because with more than 1,800 ports worldwide-- and countless land excursions offering a chance to explore a country'sinterior -- chances are you can.&quot; <BR><BR>&quot;And unlike our pioneering predecessors, you'll eat well, enjoy plushaccommodations, genuine relaxation and an exciting dose of fun,&quot; Godsmansays. <BR><BR><B>Not Your Usual Ports of Call </B><BR>Cruise vacationers seeking the unexpected will often find that they neednot venture too far from the ships, as cruise lines are punctuating theiritineraries with stops in exotic ports. Windstar Cruises, for example, stopsin Casablanca, the Moroccan city made famous by Humphrey Bogart, IngridBergman and Rick's American Cafe. Costa Cruise Lines takes passengers toDubrovnik, Croatia and Tallinn, Estonia. And, Seawind Cruise Line visitsGrenada, an island of soaring peaks covered with rain forests and dottedwith volcanic craters. <BR><BR>Radisson Seven Seas Cruises lists the Chilean fjords, the Russian Far Eastand both polar regions among its most unusual offerings, while CommodoreCruise Line takes vacationers to two Honduras ports, Puerto Cortes and RoatanIsland. In the winter, Royal Olympic Cruises' ships sail the Amazon Riverand the Straits of Magellan in South America, arriving in Rio de Janeiroin time for the spectacular Carnival celebrations. <BR><BR>Some of Crystal Cruises' itineraries include stops in Dubai, Arab EmirateRepublic; Moroni, Grande Comore Island; and Muscat, Oman, while Orient Linesstops in Ashdod, Madagascar, Antarctica, Zanzibar, Napier and Tasmania.<BR><BR>Fare, Huahine; Hiva Ov, Marquesas and Castro, Chiloe Island, Chile top thelist of unusual destinations offered by Seabourn Cruise Line, while PrincessCruises will offer, for the first time in 1997, stops in Mauritania; Aden,Aqaba; Orkney Islands; Latvia and Estonia. <BR><BR>Travelers interested in Central America can sail a partial transit of thePanama Canal with Regal Cruises, and on the way stop in Puerto Limon, CostaRica, where Christopher Columbus landed on his fourth voyage. And, Caribbeanfans also will find something unusual to see, as Carnival Cruise Lines offersits passengers a chance to visit the less-traveled ports of St. Lucia, St.Barts and St. Kitts. <BR><BR><B>Chock Full of Culture</B> <BR>For those travelers who would like to witness history in the making, SilverseaCruises offers its inaugural voyages to South Africa, where guests may witnessthe dramatic social changes taking place in this most beautiful and diverseof countries. Oceanic Cruises' August itineraries are timed to allow passengersa chance to go ashore for Japan's festivals. And those sailing with BergenLine, a newcomer to the CLIA fleet, will visit ports along Norway's westerncoast, including Alesund, known for its Art Nouveau architecture, and Trondheim,home of Nidaros Cathedral, where Norway's kings are coronated. <BR><BR>Passengers of Holland America Line will set foot in the Mayan ruins of Tikalin Guatemala and Copan in Honduras, while Cunard Line passengers will attenda party among the ancient ruins of Ephesus, in the Turkish fishing villageof Kusadasi. Cruisers looking to just kick back and relax may enjoy a day-longvisit at Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's private destinations, Labadee andCocoCay, or an afternoon stay at Taku Lodge, an Alaskan hideaway nestledamid glaciers, mountains and forests, when sailing with Celebrity Cruises.<BR><BR>Cruisers can also choose to get up close and personal with the natural phenomenaof an area. For example, when visiting Alaska with Norwegian Cruise Line,passengers on a hike can peer into and touch deep blue ice caves at MendenhallGlacier, and while sailing American Hawaii Cruises, vacationers get a super-closelook, from the deck, at the Kilauea Volcano as molten lava flows down thehillside and into the sea. <BR><BR>And, literary buffs sailing with Delta Queen Steamboat Co. may choose aside trip to The Cave, the Hannibal, Mo., boyhood home of Samuel Clemensand setting of the annual National Tom Sawyers Days Festival. <BR><BR>&quot;The sea has long intrigued travelers,&quot; says Godsman. &quot;Aslong as there are people, there will be craving for adventure and excitement,and as long as there's that, there will be a need to feel like a sailor,exploring ports unknown.&quot; <BR><BR>To learn more about the destinations accessible by cruise ship, contacta CLIA-affiliated travel agency near you.

Eight rounds of championshipgolf on the islands of the southern Caribbean. An opportunity to pick upworld-class cooking and wine-tasting tips from the pros. A chance to makenew friends with people who share your interests. <BR><BR>In a recent Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) survey, nearlyhalf the respondents rated cruises higher than other vacations because cruisesgave them the chance to meet people who enjoyed their interests. With themecruises steadily gaining in popularity, it should come as no surprise thatcruise lines are responding with new and different theme cruises. <BR><BR>&quot;Free time is at such a premium these days that people are expectingtheir vacations to provide a bit of everything: relaxation, enrichment,excitement and value,&quot; says CLIA President James G. Godsman. <BR><BR>&quot;Theme cruises fulfill all these needs, because you get to rest, learnor try something new, visit places you've never been to, and know in advancehow much you'll be spending,&quot; Godsman says. &quot;And the best partabout theme cruises is that by the end of the cruise, you'll be so relaxedthat you won't need a vacation from your vacation.&quot; <BR><BR>CLIA-member lines are continually designing new itineraries to cover a rangeof interests, from art, history and world affairs to sports, country andwestern dancing, film and comedy. Consider these offerings for January 1997and beyond from CLIA-member cruise lines: <BR><UL><LI>A variety of theme cruises aboard American Hawaii Cruises, includingwhale-watching tours in January, February and March, Big Band concert sailingsin April, August and December, and Aloha Festivals -- celebrations of theislands' history, through song, dance, art and cultural presentations --in September and October. <BR><BR><LI>Passengers aboard Bergen Line are invited to partake in a traditionalScandinavian Christmas celebration with the crew as they sail Norway's scenicwest coast. Other sailings feature lecturers who offer guests insights onNorwegian art and artists. <BR><BR><LI>An assortment of theme cruises aboard Commodore Cruise Line's vessels.Among them: an Elvis' birthday cruise (Jan. 4) and three Mexico and CentralAmerica cruises, sailing Feb. 22, April 26 and Sept. 6. <BR><BR><LI>A new theme each night aboard Costa Cruise Line's seven-night Caribbeancruises, which depart weekly through April 6.

Sailings culminatewith a dinner prepared by the guest chef.

You're on a vacation -- with your kids. You have yet tohear a peep of complaint. Not one &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; <BR><BR>This could be the best vacation of your life. Could be, you're on a cruise.And your kids? They're being entertained by a band of youth counselors withenergy to match the feistiest five-year-old. Better yet, they're makingnew friends. So you just lie back in your lounge chair and relax. <BR><BR>Some 14 percent of people who cruise take their children with them. To accommodatethese seafaring families, cruise lines affiliated with Cruise Lines InternationalAssociation (CLIA) are offering kid-safe, supervised activities that runthe gamut -- from poolside pizza and ice cream parties to Nintendo competitionsand teen disco nights -- making cruises a suitable vacation choice for parentswho prefer to bring the kids. <BR><BR>&quot;Vacations are supposed to be relaxing, but we all know that planningthem can be a nightmare, especially when you're trying to please yourselfand your kids,&quot; says CLIA President James G. Godsman, who has frequentlysailed with his own two children. <BR><BR>&quot;What people don't always realize, though, is that planning a vacationdoesn't get simpler than picking a cruise, because the right cruise offerssomething for everyone -- a chance for the grown-ups to relax and enjoysome quiet time together, and a chance for kids to make new friends andtry new things, all in a supervised environment,&quot; adds Godsman. <BR><BR>The CLIA-member lines offering activities and amenities for children oftenprovide youth counselors, playrooms stocked with games for younger and olderkids, educational activities for specific age groups, fun and games, andmore. As a rule, most family-oriented lines have programs for pre-teens(under 12) and younger. Some have special activities for 3-5-year-olds andtoddlers. Many offer babysitting services, too. <BR><BR><B>Puppets, Ukelele Lessons and Nintendo Competitions for Under-12s </B><BR>Aboard one line, don't be too surprised if you see the under-12s learningto play the ukelele, dance the hula or paint coconuts. It's all just partof the fun, like the puppet workshops, talent shows, scavenger hunts, stargazingand pool games that are offered by several lines. <BR><BR>Examples of other kid-safe and supervised activities include beach excursions;pool parties; lip sync contests; &quot;coketail,&quot; pizza and ice creamparties; arts and crafts; deck parties; birthday parties; t-shirt and facepainting; drama clubs; Nintendo competitions; card and board games and charades.<BR><BR>Some activities even sneak in a little education, for example: magic lessons,Italian- and Hawaiian-language lessons, and tours of the captain's bridge,the galley and the backstage. One line even teaches children to interpretdetailed river maps. <BR><BR><B>Whodunits, Dating Games and Ghost Stories for Teens </B><BR>Teenagers sailing with adults will find themselves as occupied as the youngerkids, with murder mystery games, beach volleyball, pool games, lip synccontests and scavenger hunts. Other teen-specific activities include makeoversand fashion tip sessions, pajama parties, toga parties, MTV trivia gamesand teen Olympics. Evening activities include disco nights and late nightboard games and movies. <BR><BR>Like the younger crowd, teens are offered lessons (in hula and foreign language)and bridge tours. They also have &quot;camp&quot; nights, when participantsbuild tents, sing camp songs, and make S'mores. <BR><BR>&quot;The activities may differ from line to line, but the result is stillthe same: fun for the kids, rest for the adults,&quot; says Godsman. <BR><BR><B>The ABCs of Cruising With Kids</B> <BR>Many of the lines offer in-room babysitting services for a nominal fee,special tuck-ins and staffed nurseries. Cribs are often available, and inaddition, several lines offer family suites which accommodate up to eightpeople. Free passage is sometimes granted for children sailing with payingadults. And, children are taught the basics of ship safety -- along withthe grown-up passengers and crew members -- nearly the moment they stepon board. <BR><BR>Some lines even offer land excursions geared toward families with children,infants included, and many offer lower excursion rates for children. <BR><BR>Mealtimes needn't be a hassle either, as most of the lines offer boosterseats and special childrens' menus, sometimes in the main dining rooms.Typical kid fare found on the menus: macaroni and cheese, spaghetti andmeatballs, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, pizza and fishsticks. <BR><BR>The CLIA-member cruise lines offering special activities and amenities forchildren are American Hawaii Cruises, Carnival Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises,Commodore Cruise Line, Costa Cruise Lines, Crystal Cruises, Cunard Line,Delta Queen Steamboat Co., Dolphin Cruise Line, Holland American Line, MajestyCruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, Premier Cruise Lines, Princess Cruises,Regal Cruises, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line and Seawind Cruise Line. DisneyCruise Line, whose ships set sail in 1998, will also cater to the familymarket. <BR><BR>To learn more about cruising with children, contact a nearby CLIA-affiliatedtravel agency. To find one, check the local yellow pages or visit CLIA'shomepage on the Internet, at (<a href="http://www.ten-io.com/clia/">http://www.ten-io.com/clia/</a>). <BR><BR>September 1996 <BR><BR>NOTE TO EDITORS: Attached is Cruise Lines International Association's (CLIA)cruise guide for children. It details the activities offered by each CLIA-membercruise line. <BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.travelleader.com/butbar2.map"><IMG SRC="http://www.travelleader.com/tlsbutbr.gif"ISMAP BORDER="0" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="78" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>CLIA</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><FONT size=-1>Contact:<BR>Diana M. Orban Associates<BR>#104819<BR>(201) 605-2121</FONT> <BR><P><CENTER><FONT size=+2><B>CRUISING MEANS BUSINESS ... AND WAVES OF FUN</B></FONT><BR>Corporations Get Onboard With Meetings and Employee Incentive Programs </CENTER><P>Have you heard about the latest wave in business conferences? <BR><BR>No extra charges for meeting rooms, coffee breaks, or a Farewell Gala. Afully-equipped business center, just steps from a gourmet restaurant anda state-of-the-art health spa. And all with a view of a sea tranquil enoughto calm even the most frayed business nerves. <BR><BR>More and more, according to Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA),conference and incentive planners are discovering these great deals aboardCLIA-member line vessels, with superb business and meeting programs forcompanies of all size. <BR><BR>Indeed, good business sense, sophisticated facilities and countless amenitieshave made cruising increasingly popular with the meetings and incentivemarket, says CLIA President James G.Godsman. <BR><BR>&quot;The all-inclusive packages offered by the cruise industry typicallycover most everything, from accommodations to meals and entertainment --even afternoon snacks and meeting space. Many times audiovisual equipmentis included,&quot; explains Godsman. &quot;What meeting or incentive plannercan overlook this kind of excellent value?&quot; <BR><BR><B>The Work Will Get Done</B> <BR>Godsman stresses that meeting attendees find the best of both business andpleasure at sea, with the latest in conference technology to help conductbusiness -- all while sailing to the most popular destinations worldwide.<BR><BR>Many lines provide unsurpassed technology, closed circuit television, satellitevideo and telephone teleconferencing, and excellent ship-to-shore communicationsby telephone, facsimile and telex. Computers loaded with the latest softwareare standard on most ships, along with professional sound and lighting systems,slide projectors and carousels, movie projectors and portable screens. <BR><BR>Some lines offer the use of a private television channel for business gatherings.Other business necessities include overhead projectors, flip charts, microphones,podiums and video cassette recorders. Business support systems at sea includesecretarial and translation services. <BR><BR><B>The Extraordinary at Sea</B> <BR>Yet Godsman also notes that outstanding food, service, recreation and customizedmeeting facilities -- plus the ability to include several destinations inone trip -- enhances the success of the shipboard venue. <BR><BR>Many lines have dedicated staff members (they're called conference coordinators)onboard to manage all details from an individual incentive program for onewinner to a full-ship charter of over 2,000 passengers. Nothing is leftto chance, says Godsman, ensuring that programs are always successfullyexecuted. <BR><BR>While many ships have designated meeting space, which can be accommodatedfor different size groups, they also feature a variety of unique indoorvenues, such as theaters, lounges and restaurants, in addition to the activitiesavailable on deck or ashore at the various ports of call. <BR><BR>Customizing cruises for corporate groups comes in a variety of forms andcan include cabin amenities, personalized pillow gifts and entertainment.For full ship charters, a company's flag can be flown on one line; anotherline can rename decks, restaurants, bars -- even their private out islands-- in honor of the company or products. <BR><BR>With sophisticated onboard printing services, many lines also personalizenapkins and menus with the company's logo in the dining room as well asspecial newsletters and daily bulletins. Upon embarkation, meeting attendeestypically find welcome notes from the captain and other cruise staff executives.<BR><BR>While shipboard dining is always a memorable feast included in the priceof a cruise -- with bountiful breakfasts, five-course luncheons, afternoontea, dinner and midnight buffets -- a group's food service can also be speciallyplanned. Theme nights, open bars, hors d'oeuvres trays and corporate logoscarved in ice are among the little special touches offered by some lines.<BR><BR><B>Unlimited Destinations </B><BR>As cruises call at practically any destination accessible by water, meetingsare also able to be held at any number of exotic locations worldwide --with the opportunity to sample a variety of destinations on one trip. Customizedshore events and sightseeing excursions, such as cocktail parties by theAlaska glaciers, private tours of the ruins and beach parties on secludedout islands, enhance the total experience. Furthermore, pre- and post-cruiseland packages can be featured. <BR><BR>&quot;We believe that once companies try cruising for their program, they'lljoin the growing ranks of repeat passengers who sail again and again. There'sdefinitely more value and service in cruising than on any land-based corporateprogram -- just the usage of meeting facilities and wonderful dining alonewithout factoring in a trip to some of the world's most spectacular destinations,&quot;concludes Godsman. <BR><BR>The CLIA-member lines catering especially to the meetings and incentivemarket include: American Hawaii Cruises, Bergen Line, Carnival Cruise Lines,Celebrity Cruises, Commodore Cruise Line, Costa Cruise Lines, Crystal Cruises,Cunard Line, Delta Queen Steamboat Co., Dolphin Cruise Line, Holland AmericaLine, Majesty Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceanic Cruises, PremierCruise Lines, Princess Cruises, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, Royal CaribbeanCruise Line, Royal Olympic Cruises, Seawind Cruise Line, Silversea Cruisesand Windstar Cruises. <BR><BR>To learn more about holding a meeting or incentive program aboard a cruiseship, contact a nearby CLIA-affiliated travel agency. To find one, visitCLIA's home page on the Internet at, (<a href="http://www.ten-io.com/clia/">http://www.ten-io.com/clia/</a>), or lookfor the blue, gold and white logo in your local travel agency's window.<BR><BR>October 1996 <BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.travelleader.com/butbar2.map"><IMG SRC="http://www.travelleader.com/tlsbutbr.gif"ISMAP BORDER="0" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="78" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Orban Associates<BR>#104824<BR>(201) 605-2121</FONT> <BR><P><CENTER><FONT size=+2><B>LET'S GET TOGETHER AT SEA</B></FONT><BR>Reunions Aboard Cruise Ships are Increasingly Popular </CENTER><P>It was an 80th birthday, a true milestone to celebrate. Twenty familymembers, spanning three generations and coming from points across the nation,gathered together. <BR><BR>Not for an evening, not for a day, but for a week -- as they sailed aboarda cruise ship in the Caribbean. <BR><BR>Indeed, for family member Tom Buckley, the reunion at sea to mark GrandpaVilmo's birthday couldn't have been sweeter. <BR><BR>&quot;The nature of a cruise vacation made our group come together in theperfect way. There were activities for everyone, from the little kids tothe older folks,&quot; says Buckley, whose own extended family includedsailors ages 3-80. <BR><BR>&quot;At meals, for instance, we had two tables reserved in the dining room,which brought us together three times a day. The cruise was just so relaxing-- even for a group of people vacationing together,&quot; says Buckley.<BR><BR>According to James G. Godsman, president of Cruise Lines International Association(CLIA), Buckley's enjoyable week of cruising with his extended family istypical of a growing trend in the cruise industry: reunion cruises for extendedfamilies as well as affinity, military and school groups. Many sailingseven include passengers who've traveled together in the past and liked theexperience so much they're repeating it. <BR><BR>&quot;There's really no better place to celebrate a special occasion orto just get together than aboard a cruise ship, with its built-in camaraderie,wide range of special discounts and amenities. With families and friendsnow living so geographically scattered, cruising offers a wonderful, common,meeting ground for people to come together and have fun,&quot; says Godsman.<BR><BR><B>Special Reunion Rates and Amenities</B> <BR>Besides their unique facilities, many cruise lines offer special rates forthe third and fourth persons in a cabin, and most have special incentivesand group rates. On Dolphin Cruise Line and Majesty Cruise Line, for example,groups of 15 can bring a 16th person for free. Regal Cruises also offersspecial group rates and meeting accommodations for groups. <BR><BR>In addition to discounts, passengers booking the Big Red Boat Family Planon Premier Cruise Lines receive special recognition and amenities, suchas champagne in the cabin, a cake in the dining room and a family photo.Special menus, cocktail parties and other group amenities -- even customizeditineraries for charter sailings -- are offered to reunion groups sailingaboard Royal Olympic Cruises. <BR><BR>If eight cabins are booked, Costa Cruise Lines offers special groups rates,noting a growth trend in family reunions on-board. Meanwhile reunion groupssailing aboard Holland America Line benefit from free use of the ship'spublic rooms for meetings and events plus special messages in the dailyschedule -- or even a separate bulletin, if the group is large enough. <BR><BR>Furthermore, multigenerational families traveling together are a trend notedby CLIA-member cruise lines, including Crystal Cruises, Radisson Seven SeasCruises and Windstar Cruises. Many lines, such as Commodore Cruise Lineand Carnival Cruise Lines, encourage family reunions with their fully supervisedactivities for children, so the older folks can have free time together.And, American Hawaii Cruises enables large families to vacation togetherby offering free passage for children with its &quot;Kids Cruise HawaiiFree in 1997&quot; promotion. <BR><BR><B>Past Passengers</B> <BR>Given the cruise industry's high repeat factor, many passengers who metaboard a cruise ship find themselves sailing together again. Last year morethan 500 past passengers sailed on Orient Lines' first &quot;Polo Club&quot;reunion cruise, which will be offered again this January in the South Pacific.Also next year, Cunard Line will feature a &quot;Sagafjord Reunion Cruise&quot;on Vistafjord to be hosted by Sagafjord's former cruise staff. Past passengerswith Norwegian Cruise Line are invited to join Latitudes, a club which rewardsrepeat passengers with savings and privileges, such as no-wait check-inareas, priority embarkation and a private reception with the Captain, amongother benefits. <BR><BR>And, each voyage on Silversea Cruises, Seabourn Cruise Line and PrincessCruises features a cocktail reception for repeat passengers. Celebrity Cruisesoffers the &quot;Captain's Club&quot; for frequent cruisers. More than oncea year, guests have the opportunity to meet each other on board at a specialcocktail party with the captain and his officers. <BR><BR><B>Even a Reunion-Themed Cruise </B><BR>Responding to the reunion trend, Delta Queen Steamboat Co. is offering steamboatvacations in 1997 to highlight 1942 (the year World War II began), 1945(the year World War II ended) and 1948 (the beginning of the Baby Boomerera). <BR><BR>For more information on reunions at sea, contact a nearby CLIA-affiliatedtravel agency. To find one, check the local yellow pages or visit CLIA'shome page on the Internet, at (<a href="http://www.ten-io.com/clia/">http://www.ten-io.com/clia/</a>). <BR><BR>September 1996 <BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.travelleader.com/butbar2.map"><IMG SRC="http://www.travelleader.com/tlsbutbr.gif"ISMAP BORDER="0" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="78" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Orban Associates<BR>#104821<BR>(201) 605-2121</FONT> <BR><P><CENTER><FONT size=+2><B>SINGLES ARE NEVER ALONE ON A CRUISE VACATION-- UNLESS THEY WANT TO BE</B></FONT></CENTER><P>Dr. Roy Bedrock can't decide what he likes most about cruising. But there'sno question that the 33-year-old single traveler has discovered a new wayto meet people: he's taken eight cruise vacations during the past four years.<BR><BR>&quot;What I most love about cruising is meeting so many fantastic people(of all ages) from around the world. I also like getting involved in allthe fun activities, visiting different places and keeping within my budget,&quot;said Dr. Bedrock, a New Jersey surgeon. &quot;You can really have it allon a cruise vacation.&quot; <BR><BR>His feeling is not unique. According to Cruise Lines International Association(CLIA), the marketing organization for the cruise industry, Dr. Bedrock'shighly positive shipboard experience typifies the reason so many singletravelers enjoy cruising: the atmosphere on a cruise is ideal for peopletraveling alone, precisely because it's so easy to meet people. <BR><BR>From friends he's made at sea, for instance, Dr. Bedrock still receivesholiday cards, invitations to visit and traveling companions for futurevacations. <BR><BR>&quot;Cruising is an ideal choice for single travelers because it's so easyto meet other people with your own interests -- and it's completely hassle-free,&quot;says CLIA President James G. Godsman. <BR><BR>About 25 percent of today's cruise passengers are single. While most travelwith friends or relatives, about four percent travel alone. These solo travelersare finding a growing number of cruise lines which are particularly welcomingand accommodating. <BR><BR>&quot;There's an immediate sense of community once you step onboard,&quot;says Godsman, &quot;which makes a cruise the ideal environment for someonewho prefers to travel alone. Single travelers, like Dr. Bedrock, will delightin the wonderfully relaxed ambience of a cruise.&quot; <BR><BR>To appeal to the passengers who prefer to travel solo, adds Godsman, manyCLIA-member cruise lines are offering a variety of attractions, includingspecial rates and onboard social activities. <BR><BR>CLIA member lines that particularly cater to single passengers include AmericanHawaii Cruises, Celebrity Cruises, Commodore Cruise Line, Costa Cruise Lines,Crystal Cruises, Cunard Line, Delta Queen Steamboat Co., Dolphin CruiseLine, Holland America Line, Majesty Cruise Line, Orient Lines, PrincessCruises, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, Royal Olympic Cruises, Seabourn CruiseLine and Silversea Cruises. <BR><BR>Many offer reduced single supplements, some for as low as 15 percent abovethe usual cruise fares; one line even discounts the fares for children travelingwith single parents. Other lines enable passengers to share a cabin withanother (same-sex) passenger assigned by the line. <BR><BR>Once onboard, single passengers are never alone if they don't want to be,says Godsman. Besides the regularly scheduled onboard daytime events, nighttimeparties and entertainment, many lines offer activities exclusively for singles.For example, there are &quot;ice-breaker&quot; parties at the start of thecruise so people can get to know each other as soon as the ship leaves port.Many lines feature &quot;Gentleman Host&quot; programs, providing maleshosts who serve as dance and social partners for the ladies traveling alone-- especially those who love to dance the waltz, fox-trot and ever-popularrumba. <BR><BR>However, Dr. Bedrock has found that cruising is a great vacation for anyone.Indeed, he's thinking of taking another cruise in the near future -- thistime with his girlfriend -- so he can ask her to marry him. <BR><BR>To learn more about what cruise lines are offering single passengers, contacta CLIA-affiliated travel agency near you. To find one, visit CLIA's homepage on the Internet, at (<a href="http://www.ten-io.com/clia/">http://www.ten-io.com/clia/</a>), or look for the blue,gold and white logo in your local travel agency's window. <BR><BR>September 1996 <BR><BR>NOTE TO EDITORS: Attached is Cruise Lines International Association's (CLIA)guide for single passengers, which highlights the programs offered by eachCLIA-member cruise line. <BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.travelleader.com/butbar2.map"><IMG SRC="http://www.travelleader.com/tlsbutbr.gif"ISMAP BORDER="0" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="78" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

YOU'D BE SURPRISED...</B></FONT></CENTER><P>Looking to do something different? <BR><BR>How about rubbing noses with a Maori tribe member in New Zealand; testingyour golf swing at Pebble Beach or Augusta with virtual reality golf; oreating toasted marshmallows at a &quot;camp-out&quot; under the supervisionof a youth counselor? <BR><BR><B>You can do it all -- while taking a cruise vacation. </B><BR>Indeed, says Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the marketingorganization for the cruise industry, today's cruise vacationers are discoveringan extraordinary array of unusual activities, both onboard and at portsof call. <BR><BR>&quot;With more than 100 ships and 5,400 itineraries from which to choose,there are many unique activities for passengers to enjoy, and the best thingis that many are already included in the price of a cruise,&quot; says JamesG. Godsman, president of CLIA. &quot;Plus keep in mind that all these activitiesare taking place while you're sailing to the world's most popular destinations.&quot;<BR><BR><B>Life at Sea </B><BR>While some passengers may choose to do nothing but lie back and read a bookin a comfortable deck chair, others get involved in the many innovativeofferings aboard today's cruise ships. Sports buffs, for example, can tryPrincess Cruises' &quot;New Waves Scuba and Snorkeling Program&quot; thatenables passengers to become certified scuba divers and participate in demonstrations,classes and tours, as well as scuba excursions and refresher courses. InAlaska, passengers sailing with Norwegian Cruise Line can don wetsuits andscuba dive, while on Cunard Line's Sea Goddess I and II, water sports enthusiastsenjoy jet skiing and water skiing from small launches off the stern. Andgolfers can perfect their games aboard Crystal Cruises, with golf clinicsorganized by a full-time golf pro, and a driving range where passengerscan practice their swings. <BR><BR>For the less athletically-inclined, a huge array of activities can filleach day. For instance, Carnival Cruise Lines offers passengers, from youngstersto adults, a chance to experience the realm of virtual reality with itscutting-edge electronic game technology featuring 60 state-of-the-art videoand arcade games in a million-dollar entertainment complex. Passengers cantry flying a kite on Delta Queen Steamboat Company's steamboatin' vacations.On Royal Olympic Cruises, passengers can learn Greek dances. And aboardWindstar Cruises, fledgling sailors can actually steer the vessel from theflying bridge -- under the watchful supervision of the captain, of course.<BR><BR>And, aboard Bergen Line, a newcomer to the CLIA fleet, passengers sailingthe scenic west coast Norway will be baptized by &quot;King Neptune&quot;as they cross the Arctic Circle. <BR><BR>&quot;The key to a cruise is choice,&quot; Godsman says. &quot;Whether you'reinto sports or intellectual pursuits, or both, you're sure to find somethingto please.&quot; <BR><BR>In addition, culture is sometimes brought onboard. For example, those sailingin Alaska on Seabourn Cruise Line might get a visit and lecture from a wildlifeexpert, who brings along an eagle and owl. And, passengers visiting EasternEurope might be treated to a performance staged by a Romanian dance group.<BR><BR>Evening also brings a range of wonderful experiences. Passengers can seethe orange glow of molten lava flowing down a hillside on Hawaii's Big Island,while sailing with American Hawaii Cruises. Amateur astronomers can checkout the placement of constellations from a special Stargazing Deck withits state-of-the-art instruments aboard Royal Caribbean Cruise Line. Orpassengers can participate in a &quot;Roman Bacchanal&quot; by dressingup in artfully arranged sheets and joining in the fun of a toga party atsea given by Costa Cruise Lines -- or sing their favorite tunes in CommodoreCruise Line's lively karaoke bar. The art of fine living is exemplifiedon Celebrity Cruises, where cigar aficionados delight in hand-rolled cigarschosen from antique humidors and formally presented to each table, in specialcigar &quot;cafes&quot; aboard the line's newer ships. <BR><BR><B>On Land</B> <BR>As travelers show an increasing eagerness to try new destinations, CLIA-membercruise lines also strive for diversity in their shore offerings for allages. Children vacationing on Holland America Line can participate in educationaladventures ashore geared for two age groups: six to 12, and teens. At RadissonSeven Seas Cruises, passengers can take sightseeing excursions by Zodiaclanding craft to areas with exceptional wildlife and flora, but too remotefor docking or wharf facilities. Orient Lines even features optional helicopteror &quot;flightseeing&quot; excursions, which depart directly from the ship'shelipad to the fjords of New Zealand. And, guests traveling on select SilverseaCruises pre- and post-cruise Micato Safaris will visit the Samburu/ShabaGame Reserve, where Born Free was filmed and where lush vegetation is hometo exotic wildlife, including elephants, cheetah and leopards. <BR><BR>To find out more about the unusual activities offered by specific cruiselines, contact one of the nearly 23,000 travel agencies affiliated withCLIA. To find one, visit CLIA's home page on the Internet, at (<a href="http://www.ten-io.com/clia/">http://www.ten-io.com/clia/</a>),or look for the blue, gold and white logo in your local travel agency'swindow. <BR><BR>September 1996 <BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.travelleader.com/butbar2.map"><IMG SRC="http://www.travelleader.com/tlsbutbr.gif"ISMAP BORDER="0" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="78" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Every last detail -- photography, videotaping,flowers, wedding cake, champagne, witnesses and someone to officiate theceremony -- was arranged for her by a company that plans weddings aboardcruise ships. <BR><BR>&quot;It was so easy. I felt no stress,&quot; said Van Cleve, who livesin California. <BR><BR>Van Cleve's wedding was held in June in the library of a Holland AmericaLine ship as it awaited embarkation in Fort Lauderdale. Following the ceremony,which Mona described as &quot;tasteful and sweet,&quot; she and husbandDerek sailed to the Eastern Caribbean for a week-long honeymoon. <BR><BR>Holland America Line is one of several CLIA members to offer wedding packages.Others are American Hawaii Cruises, Carnival Cruise Lines, Costa CruiseLines, Dolphin Cruise Line, Majesty Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line,Orient Lines and Princess Cruises. Royal Caribbean Cruise Line and CelebrityCruises report that wedding packages are in development. Disney Cruise Line,whose ships set sail in 1998, will also offer wedding packages. <BR><BR>Participating cruise lines offer a variety of wedding plans in several priceranges, from small (like Mona and Derek's) to large. The bride and groommay choose to be married, or surrounded by friends and family. Among theoptions are receptions, hot and cold hors d'oeuvres, sit-down luncheons,photography, videotaping, cake-cutting, champagne toasts, floral arrangementsand music. Some lines even offer tuxedo and shoe rental. <BR><BR>Onboard wedding ceremonies are performed in U.S. and Canadian ports, bywhomever the couple prefers -- for example, a member of the clergy or acivic employee who comes aboard for the occasion, or in some case's, anauthorized ship officer. Some ceremonies take place on deck, with a sunsetfor a cathedral or a temple; some take place in onboard chapels; still othersare held at a port, on a terrace overlooking a beach in St. Thomas, U.S.Virgin Islands, or at a castle on one of the island's summits, for example.In all cases, arrangements are made either by a wedding coordinator whoworks for the cruise line or by an outside event planner. <BR><BR><B>After The Wedding Day</B> <BR>The romance doesn't end with wedding packages, since a number of CLIA-memberlines offer special packages for honeymoons, anniversaries and vow renewals.<BR><BR>Most participating lines provide honeymooners with complimentary champagnein the cabin upon arrival. In addition, depending on the package purchased,honeymooners might enjoy champagne breakfasts in bed, chocolate-coveredstrawberries, canapes and petit fours delivered to the cabin each night,fruit baskets, photos, engraved champagne flutes, matching bathrobes, redroses on the pillow and massages, among other offerings. <BR><BR>Some cruise lines also offer packages for couples wishing to celebrate ananniversary or renew their wedding vows. Among the anniversary package features:flowers in cabin, engraved champagne flutes and cake. Those renewing theirvows might opt for flowers, a reception, photo album and music, wines, champagnes,hors d'oeuvres and more. <BR><BR>The CLIA-member lines offering honeymoon, anniversary or vow renewal packagesare American Hawaii Cruises, Carnival Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises, CommodoreCruise Line, Costa Cruise Lines, Crystal Cruises, Cunard Line, Delta QueenSteamboat Co., Dolphin Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Majesty CruiseLine, Norwegian Cruise Line, Premier Cruise Lines, Princess Cruises, RadissonSeven Seas Cruises, Regal Cruises, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, Royal OlympicCruises, Seabourn Cruise Line, Seawind Cruise Line and Windstar Cruises.<BR><BR>To learn more about celebrating a wedding, vow renewal, honeymoon or anniversaryaboard a cruise ship, contact a CLIA-affiliated travel agency.

<center><font size=+2>TOUR OPERATORS: A BRIEF HISTORY</font></center>
<p>
Throughout the ages, groups of travelers, eager to discover the unknown, have banded together and embarked on journeys to destinations near and far.  One can perhaps imagine the ancient forerunners of today's tour operators shepherding toga-clad tourists through the hanging gardens of Babylon, around the Great Pyramids at Giza, or on side trips to Ephesus.
<p>
Modern tour operators -- or organizers of group tours -- as we know them today, date back to the mid-nineteenth century, and most likely have their roots as ticket agents for steamship lines and railroads.  In addition to selling passage, the agents were eventually called upon to develop itineraries and secure accommodations for their wealthy clients.  Out of this grew the organized business of selling planned tours to groups of travelers.
<p>
<b><font size=+1>A Brief Chronology</font></b>
<p>
By the 1850's, railroad tours were already in operation, followed, after World War I, by the packaging of steamship tours.  By the time Lindbergh landed at Le Bourget in 1927, six current members of the United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA) were already established companies.  Through the '30's tour wholesaling continued to grow, but slowly, since comfortable and affordable means of passenger transportation were not widespread, and travel was costly.
<p>
The post-World War II period, beginning with the late '40's and early '50's, marked a dramatic turning point for the tour operator industry.  The reason: the introduction of modern long-range commercial aircraft.  A new avaiation technology now resulted in lowered airfares, for the first time opening long distance travel to millions of middle class Americans.  
<p>
Since the postwar period, many of USTOA's current Active Members have helped open doors to new and exotic parts of the world.  In 1955, for instance, at the height of "The Cold War," even though no single air carrier flew then from North America to eastern Europe, one present-day USTOA member made it possible for Americans to visit eastern European countries and Russia.
<p>
The development of charter air travel opened doors still further.  In 1959, another current USTOA member, using a charter DC-6, developed a first series of tours visiting all four major Hawaiian Islands, for a lower price than the lowest scheduled airfare to Honolulu.
<p>
By the late '60's, yet another USTOA Active Member had brought more than 8,000 tourists to what were then a few small fishing villages on Spain's now-famous Costa del Sol.  At the time, the only air service available was a 44-seat turboprop plane which flew from Madrid three times a week.  Compare that with today's daily 747 service from New York to the Costa Del Sol, and it's easy to see how tour operators were able to influence the growth of a major international resort area.
<p>
With the growing importance of the tour operator's role in providing arrangements for an increasingly travel-oriented public, the need for an organization to represent this industry arose.  In 1972, the United States Tour Operators Association was formed, providing an organized voice for the professional tour operator community.
<p>
<b><font size=+1>Tour Operators Today</font></b>
<p>
Today there are more than 300 independent tour operators, primarily engaged in the business of wholesaling tours.  Through volume buying, thorough research into all destinations, facilities and services, these tour operators negotiate and contract with various suppliers to put together creative itineraries and tour packages.  These travel packages are then marketed primarily through independent retail travel agents.  
<p>
USTOA President Robert E. Whitley estimates that the majority of the tour packages sold by travel agents in the U.S. are booked through USTOA members, half of whom were already in operation before the advent of commercial jet travel!  All combined, USTOA's Active Members have more than 1,100 years in the travel business.  This group of Active Members includes some of the leading companies in the tour industry.  The organization's strict membership requirements and code of ethics help assure today's consumers that they are traveling with professionals whose aim is to deliver quality service and value.

<center><font size=+2>SMART TRAVELER'S PLANNING KIT FREE FROM USTOA</font></center>
<p>
"The Smart Traveler's Planning Kit," free from the United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA), is a colorful brochure jacket containing two handy pamphlets with helpful information on planning a tour or vacation.
<p>
"How to Select a Tour or Vacation Package" guides travelers through the many factors involved in choosing the right vacation. An explanation of the various types of tours and packages, a glossary of commonly used terms, and an explanation of the tour operator's role and responsibilities help consumers make better-informed decisions.
<p>
"The Standard for Confident Travel" explains USTOA's $1 Million Consumer Protection Plan.  The largest such plan in the travel industry, USTOA's Consumer Protection Plan protects travelers' payments and deposits in the case of a USTOA-Member bankruptcy or insolvency.
<p>
"The Smart Taveler's Planning Kit" literally puts all the basic information a traveler needs to begin planning their vacation right at their fingertips," says USTOA president Bob Whitley.
<p>
USTOA's 44-Active Member companies provide a wide gamut of vacation selections, ranging from domestic to international, and from city packages to adventure explorations. Travelers can select from modular arrangements, choosing their hotel and building on any other features they like; to all-inclusive, fully escorted tours.  To qualify for USTOA membership, a company must meet some of the most stringent requirements in the travel industry. 
<p>
USTOA's Active Member companies are responsible for the majority of all package vacations and tours sold nationwide by U.S. travel agents.  According to a recent survey, USTOA member companies annually move more than 5.6 million passengers, and account for an annual sales volume of more than $3.7 billion.
<p>
For a free copy of "The Smart Traveler's Planning Kit," write to USTOA, 211 East 51st Street, Suite 12B, New York, NY 10022.

<p>
<center><font size=+2>PLANNING A VACATION PACKAGE OR TOUR SOON?
<p>
HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</font></center>
<p>
1) Q. What does a tour operator do?
<p>
A. A tour operator puts together travel "packages" involving a number of different elements: airlines, ground transportation, hotels, restaurants, local guides and other services for one or more destinations.  These packages are sold to the public, usually through travel agents.
<p>
2) Q. What is a vacation package?
<p>
A. A vacation package combines multiple travel elements into an all-inclusive price.  This price is usually lower than if the elements were purchased separately.  Volume purchasing makes this possible.  Any of the following elements (or others) can be present in a package: air transportation, lodgings/ accommodations, meals, motorcoach, rail or private vehicle, entertainment, car rental, airport transfers, sightseeing, etc.  One or more destinations can be involved, and optional elements can be added.
<p>
3) Q. What is a tour?
<p>
A. A tour is a trip taken by a group of people who travel together and follow a pre-planned itinerary.  Most tours include accommodations, a number of meals, sightseeing, land transportation and/or other transportation, plus the services of a professional tour manager or escort who accompanies the group.
<p>
4) Q. What are the benefits of a vacation package or tour?
<p>
A. Besides lower price, the traveler enjoys peace of mind and convenience.  Prepayment covers all major expenses, so that money concerns are minimized.  On group tours, there is the added camaraderie of other travelers. Tour operator representatives visit destinations in advance of tours, checking hotel quality, dining facilities, equipment, etc.  This advance planning allows realistic information to be passed along to travel agents, and then to their clients.
<p>
5) Q. Is it advisable to book through a travel agent?
<p>
 A. Yes.  Travel agents are professionals with travel savvy who have the latest information, first-hand knowledge and experience in all phases of travel.  They know the tour operators and can be especially helpful in arranging all-inclusive tours.  Agents can translate a traveler's preferences into those specific packages that will best satisfy each traveler's needs, style and budget.
<p>
6) Q. What does the USTOA symbol in a travel brochure mean to a consumer?
<p>
A. It means that the tour operator has been in business at least three years and has 18 industry references.  Additionally, the company must participate in USTOA's Consumer Protection Plan by posting a $1 million bond, letter of credit or certificate of deposit to be used soley for reimbursing consumers in the case of bankruptcy or insolvency.  The symbol also represents commitment to truth, accuracy and clarity in advertising.  In a nutshell, a company deserving your confidence.
<p>
7) Q. Where can consumers get additional information about USTOA, its members, the destinations they serve, and how to select a tour or vacation package?
<p>
A. Write to the United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA), 211 East 51st Street, Suite 12B, New York, NY  10022, or call (212) 750-7371.

<center><font size=+2>HOW TO CHOOSE A TOUR</font></center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Will a direct flight get you to your destination nonstop?
<li>What is the difference between a tour escort, local host, and tour guide?
<li>What does the term "all-inclusive" in a tour brochure really mean?
</ul>
<p>
To answer these questions, and others, the United States Tour Operators Association has issued a booklet, "How To Select A Tour or Vacation Package."  
<p>
The booklet spells out guidelines for choosing a tour, and offers advice on how to read a tour brochure.  Consumers will also find a glossary of terms to help them understand the language of travel.
<p>
The USTOA brochure answers a commonly asked question: What exactly does a tour operator do?  A tour operator puts together the best possible vacation "packages" at rates usually lower than individual travelers can do on their own.  Tour operators accomplish this by combining items like hotel accommodations, transportation, sightseeing, and meals, in volume.  These "packages" are then sold as a unit to the traveling public through travel agents.
<p>
"How to Select a Tour or Vacation Package" offers a number of suggestions like, "list your vacation goals before you see your travel agent."  According to Bob Whitley, USTOA's President, "This simple exercise will help guard against disappointment and will help insure a successful vacation."
<p>
How do you recognize a professional tour?  One way is to look for the USTOA symbol on tour brochures.  "The USTOA symbol means that a member subscribes to the organization's strict code of ethics," explains Mr. Whitley.  "Member operators must clearly state all costs and facilities in their advertising and promotional materials," he says.  "They must also participate in USTOA's $1 Million Consumer Protection Plan, which reimburses travelers in the case of a member-company bankruptcy or insolvency," he adds.
<p>
For a free copy of "How To Select A Tour or Vacation Package," contact USTOA at 211 East 51st Street, Suite 12B, New York, N.Y.  10022, (212) 750-7371.

<center><font size=+2>HOW TO READ A TOUR BROCHURE
USTOA OFFERS TEN HINTS</font></center>
<p>
For some travelers, half the fun of going on a trip is preparing for it.  The more you know before you go, the more satisfying the trip will be.
<p>
Robert E. Whitley, President of the United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA), suggests that travelers "read up" on their destination's history and characteristics, and study the climate to select the appropriate clothes for various activities.  But most of all, Mr. Whitley urges, to ensure a successful trip, travelers should read the tour brochure the travel agent has provided.  "It is the best way to avoid disappointment and know what you're getting for your dollar," he says.
<p>
To aid travelers in understanding and getting the most from a tour brochure, USTOA offers the following guidelines: 	
<p>
<ul>
<li>Price:  Be sure to check carefully what is included in the tour price and what is not.  Are airfare, meals, transfers, accommodations, sightseeing covered?
<p>
<li>Itinerary: Read the itinerary thoroughly.  Are all the spots you planned to see included?  Too many?   Too few?
<p>
<li>Pace: Will the tour include too many places in too short a time?  Is there enough free time, or too much?  Too much walking for your comfort?  Not enough sightseeing?  Check these against your preferences.
<p>
<li>Size of Group: Do you want a smaller, more personalized tour, or a larger group where you can share the trip with a variety of people?  Make sure that this aspect of the tour matches your own needs and preferences.
<p>
<li>Terms: Foreign hotel ratings may not reflect American standards. Understand that "economy" may mean a private bath in the U.S. but not necessarily overseas; and that a "deluxe" hotel in one country could differ in size, style, and degree of luxury from a similarly rated hotel in another country.  Ask about the location and facilities of your hotels before you select your tour.
<p>
<li>Single Supplement: Many tours charge extra for travelers who are traveling by themselves.  Check out the total cost beforehand.
<p>
<li>Conditions: READ CAREFULLY the "conditions page in your brochure.  It explains the tour operator's rights and yours, service or schedule substitutions, baggage allowances and damage policy, cancellation and penalty policies, and a lot more.  Take particular note of the "Responsibility" clause which describes legal rights and relationships of and between the operator, the suppliers of tour components, and the traveler.
<p>
<li>Compare: If one agency features your dream tour for $1,000 and another the same one for $300, check what the differences are.  Which offers the most for your money?  Remember, you get what you pay for.  Don't be fooled -- do your homework.
<p>
<li>Questions: Don't hesitate to ask your travel agent any questions you might have relating to the information in a brochure.  The agent will be able to answer, or will get the information for you from the tour operator.
<p>
<li>USTOA: To help in your quest for the perfect tour, write for a free copy of "How To Select A Tour or Vacation Package," available from USTOA, 211 East 51st Street, Suite 12B, New York, New York  10022.
</ul>
<p>
The United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA) was founded in 1972 as a nonprofit trade organization to foster professional and financial "integrity in tourism."  USTOA has established high standards of ethical conduct among its members, disseminates pertinent information, and requires clarity and honesty in advertising.

<center><font size=+2>WHAT TRAVEL AGENTS LOOK FOR
WHEN THEY PICK YOUR TOUR COMPANY</font></center>
<p>
Years in Business, Consumer Protection Plan, Financial Guarantees
<p>
What does your travel agent look for when selecting a travel company to package your vacation?  According to a recently completed benchmark study, years in business, participation in a consumer protection plan, and financial guarantees rank as the most important factors in travel agents' selection of a tour operator.
<p>
The study, conducted for the Institute of Certified Travel Agents (ICTA), and co-sponsored by the United States Tour Operators Association, queried more than 1,000 travel agents nationwide who were asked to rank 13 different factors in booking with a tour operator. 
<p>
More than 80% of responding agents cited the number of years in business, financial guarantees, and participation in a consumer protection plan as the most important factors in booking with a tour operator.  There were some geographical differences:  More agents in the northeast and south, for instance, considered participation in a consumer protection plan and financial guarantees as extremely important than did agents in the west and midwest.  The number of years a tour operator was in business proved slightly less important to agents in the northeast, but nearly equally important to agents in other areas of the U.S.
<p>
USTOA affiliation ranked higher than any other organization, with more than 60% of those polled citing USTOA membership as extremely important.  USTOA's 44 Active Member companies must meet some of the travel industry's highest standards, including participation in USTOA's $1 Million Consumer Protection Plan,which requires each company to post $1 Million in trust solely for protecting customers' deposits and payments in the event of the company's closure or bankruptcy.  
<p>
For more information on the USTOA $1 million Consumer Protection Plan, contact the organization at 211 East 51st Street, Suite 12B, New York, NY 10022; (212) 750-7371;

<center><font size=+2>USTOA'S MILLION-DOLLAR CONSUMER PROTECTION PLAN</font></center>
<p>
Protecting consumers' dollars has traditionally been a cornerstone of the United States Tour Operators Association since its inception in 1972.  In an effort to provide the traveling public with the best possible protection plan, USTOA requires that each of its Active category members  post $1 million in security specifically to protect consumers in the case of bankruptcy or default.
<p>
Since September, 1993, USTOA's consumer protection plan has stipulated that each of the organization's Active Member companies put up $1 million in the form of either a bond, letter of credit, or certificate of deposit.  The security, to be held by USTOA, is solely for use in reimbursing consumer deposits and payments resulting from a member company bankruptcy or insolvency.  The $1 million dollar per company amount dramatically increased USTOA's original bonding requirement of $250,000 per company, and replaced the organization's previous $5 million aggregate insurance plan.
<p>
According to USTOA president, Robert Whitley, "We concluded that the best possible consumer protection is to ensure the financial strength and stability of the membership itself.  It takes a financially stable company to demonstrate commitment to consumers by turning over $1 million that they cannot touch themselves.  This kind of commitment assures consumers that our organization is made up of financially stable companies, and that, in an uncertain economy, travelers can continue to turn to USTOA as the standard for consumer protection in tours and vacation packages.  
<p>
In the event that a USTOA-Member company declares bankruptcy or otherwise becomes insolvent, USTOA's consumer protection plan will provide for reimbursement of travelers' deposits and payments for up to $1 million.  "Historically consumer losses almost never exceed $1 million," remarks Whitley, adding that the USTOA consumer protection plan continues to represent the largest such program of any organization within the industry.
<p>
A brochure entitled "The Standard for Confident Travel" details the protection plan, and is available free to consumers by writing to the United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA), 211 East 51st Street, Suite 12B, New York, NY 10022.  Consumers can also request a list of USTOA's Active Member companies, all of whom must participate in the plan.
<p>
USTOA's Active Member companies are responsible for the majority of all package vacations and tours sold nationwide by U.S. travel agents.  In addition to the $1 million consumer protection bond, every USTOA Active Member has been in business at least three years under the same ownership, has met a specified minimum in terms of dollar volume or numbers of travelers carried, has supplied references from 18 companies within the travel industry, and carries at least $1 million liability and omissions insurance.

<p>
<center><font size=+2>MEXICO OFFERS SOME OF THE BEST IN SNORKELING, SKIN AND SCUBA DIVING</font></center>
<p>
Some of the best snorkeling, skin and scuba diving spots in the world are located off Mexico's 6,000 miles of coastline. With more than three million active divers in the United States alone, 600,000 of whom are active travelers, it is no wonder that the dive market is estimated at more than a billion dollars annually. And Mexico already has a substantial portion of the pie.
<p>
Mexico's appeal to divers is the same as its appeal to travelers of all kinds: the ability to deliver world-class accommodations and service at the same time it offers unspoiled natural wonders and cultural discoveries. The proximity of Mexico's dive sites to excellent resort facilities, enabling non-divers to enjoy their stay as well, is the main appeal.
<p>
On the Caribbean, the clear, warm lagoons of Cozumel, Cancun and Isla Mujeres teem with tropical fish and incredible coral deposits of intricate formation and colorful hues. Those resorts on the west coast also offer ideal conditions for skin and scuba diving.
<p>
The excellent condition of Mexico's dive sites is no happy accident. It is, in part, a result of the country's early decision to preserve its marine environment while encouraging the growth of sustainable tourism. Natural reserves include the northern end of the Sea of Cortes as well as many islands that serve as homes to land and sea creatures. 
<p>Prime underwater sites in Mexico fall into three main categories: the West Coast/Sea of Cortes, the Caribbean and the unique cenotes of the Yucatan Peninsula. To experienced snorkelers and divers, each area offers its own special rewards.
<p>
<font size=+1>Baja, Pacific Coast and the Sea of Cortes</font><br>
Along the Baja's Pacific coast are innumerable beaches and lagoons that offer great scuba diving. Those who dive off the beaches of Ensenada, however, find the water very cold, requiring rubber suits.
<p>
The Sea of Cortes, which separates the Baja Peninsula from the mainland, on the other hand, is warm and regarded by many biologists as the richest marine habitat on earth. It is home to numerous species of whales, including the gray whales that make their well-known migration from the North in early spring. Because its waters are temperate, this area lacks the bright tropical coral of the Caribbean. What attracts divers is the opportunity to swim with such large creatures as whales, sea lions, dolphins, manta rays, groupers and dozens of other awe-inspiring giants of the deep.
<p>
As Eric Hanauer wrote in his book  Discover Diving, "I have been diving the Sea of Cortes for twenty years, and the surprises keep coming: a living wall of manta rays as far as the eye can see, schooling hammerhead sharks, pods of pilot whales, massive jewelfish, dolphins and manta rays doing flips in the wake of our boat. For experienced divers, the biggest thrill underwater is seeing something bigger than themselves, and Baja is one of the best places in the world for that to happen."
<p>
Los Cabos, the resort at the tip of the Peninsula, has become home base for serious as well as beginner divers. Nearby sites such as Land's End, La Largo and the Blowhole offer a variety of degrees of difficulty. All are served by highly professional dive shops and guides. For the more experienced,  world-famous sites such as Submarine Canyon, with its well-known sandfall and rich variety of spectacular marine life, test even the most skilled divers.
<p>
La Paz, on the inner coast of the Peninsula, attracts divers with boat trips to the underwater pinnacles called sea mounts, where schools of whales and mantas congregate. Loreto, about a third of the way up the coast, provides access to a string of islands filled with wildlife on land and in the surrounding sea.
<p>
The newest diving facility on the West Coast is the Solmar V. This $3-million live-aboard vessel offers four-to-seven-day trips to all of the Baja Peninsula/Sea of Cortes' most famous sites, including the Revillagigedo Islands, a divers' mecca some 200 miles south of Los Cabos. 
<p>
Though their marine life is less concentrated, resorts all along the mainland's Pacific coast from Mazatlan to Huatulco provide excellent snorkeling and diving, plus the amenities and diversity on land for which Mexico is known. Their more tropical waters encourage colorful coral and marine life of a different sort than is found further north. Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo offers some of the best, as its shallow bay waters are perfect for skin diving and an off-shore coral reef and warm waters attract snorkelers to view a wide array of fish.
<p>
<font size=+1>The Caribbean Coast</font><br>
On the opposite side of Mexico, the Caribbean-washed shores of the Yucatan Peninsula beckon snorkelers and divers with a completely different undersea world. Here, the sparkling sea barely conceals brilliant coral, tropical fish and exotic marine plants and animals. At 80 to 100 feet divers can still observe magnificent coral gardens and fish, as well as guns, anchors and sealed chests remaining from 15th-century shipwrecks.
<p>
Cozumel, an island 12 miles off the Caribbean coast and the resort of Cancun, is Mexico's number-one diving and snorkeling destination. Known for its exquisitely clear water and for its proximity to Palancar Reef, the second longest reef in world, it attracts divers from all over the world. A series of reefs sheltered in the strait between the island and the Yucatan Peninsula offers beginners a spectacular introduction to the wonders of reef communities, while advanced argonauts can dive into the magnificent undersea canyons that Jacques Cousteau called one of the finest dive sites in the world.
<p>
Beginning snorkelers will find the area of Chankanab Lagoon the ideal spot to break in their flippers. Just steps away from Cozumel's beachfront hotels, the marine park blossoms with brilliant life in just a few feet of crystalline water. A boat trip to the waters around Isla Mujeres reveals shallow reefs that display their bright treasures in about 40 feet of water.
<p>
With its excellent dive shops and schools, Cozumel is also the place to learn scuba diving or earn the certification that entitles one to sign up for the more advanced diving adventures. Experienced hands recommend seeking out instructors certified by the Professional Association of Dive Instructors (PADI) or the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI).
<p>
South of Cancun, the Caribbean coast is a series of hidden beaches, lagoons and reefs where swimming and snorkeling can combine with exploring the monuments of ancient Mayan civilization and the wrecks of Spanish galleons. 
<p>
Akumal, almost directly across from Cozumel, also skirts Palancar Reef. Its 10-mile-long palm-fringed beach is dotted with cottage beach resorts that have long catered to divers. The waters here have a visibility of up to 200 feet and stay at body temperature all year. An exhibit of items recovered from shipwrecks is on display at the CEDAM Museum next to Club Akumal.
<p>
Just south of Akumal is a new watersports theme park, Xcaret. For those who have never snorkeled before, the park offers a float on a river through an underground cavern and the inlet on which itÕs located forms a natural aquarium, considered one of the most beautiful of Mexico's underwater showplaces. 
<p>
Cancun, itself, is great for those who wish to snorkel off its calmer beaches and those who wish to learn the basics of diving as part of their vacation. All the larger hotels can make arrangements for both instruction and equipment.
<p>
Most experienced divers staying in Cancun take the ferry over to Isla Mujeres, where coral reefs and lagoons are known among divers worldwide. Both snorkelers and divers head to El Garrafon Beach, at the end of the five-mile-long island to view the lovely coral gardens teeming with brightly colored fish.
<p>
<font size=+1>Cenotes and Caverns: Ultimate Adventure</font><br>
Geographically, the Yucatan Peninsula consists of a limestone slab thinly covered with soil. Rain seeps into cracks in the rock, ultimately forming underground rivers and lakes. Eventually the water erodes the limestone surface, which collapses, forming a well, or cenote. These cenotes, with their precious stores of fresh water, became the centers of ancient Mayan cities on the Peninsula. 	
<p>
Today, they afford some of the greatest cave-diving adventures in the world. Connected by winding underground limestone labyrinths, the cenotes conceal secrets of the past, from marine fossils to Mayan artifacts. At Akumal, scientists have found what appear to be artifacts from the ancient peoples who preceded the Maya in this part of the Americas.
<p>
Near the resort of Puerto Aventuras south of Cancun, dive instructors offer trips into what the Guinness Book of World Records calls the longest underground cave system in the world. Reachable from a cenote, Nohoch cavern contains brilliant white columns, 1000-foot rooms, and air spaces that allow snorkelers to experience wonders usually accessible only to scuba divers.
<p>
Other cenotes and cave systems popular with divers include the Tunel de Chelentum, Bolon-Xojol and NocAc. These highly specialized activities require expert guidance for all but the most experienced divers. Some tour operators can arrange for cenote and cavern diving in advance. The other option is to check with dive/snorkel-oriented resorts and caba–as on Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and along the Yucatan Peninsula Coast. One helpful guide is the Yucatan Peninsula Handbook, 1993, by Chicki Mallan (Moon Publications).

BACKGROUNDER
<p>
<center><font size=+2>THE ART OF MEXICO--A COMBINATION OF PAST AND PRESENT</font></center>
<p>
The art of Mexico represents a blend of different cultures. It pervades every facet of life. For 2,000 years Mexicans have been creating works in a variety of media--from the massive stone sculptures of the Olmecs to the colorful murals of 20th-century painters. If this incredible array of art has anything in common, it is the theme of Mexico, itself a nation with a unique combination of indigenous, European and hybrid cultures.
<p>
The art of Mexico, characterized by strong colors, technical brilliance and  underlying nationalism, has often been inspired by religious or political devotion. Such examples as the elaborate wall paintings surrounding Aztec and Mayan pyramids or the larger-then-life murals of this century, reveal Mexico's diverse politcal and cultural past.
<p>
Mexico's crafts, on the other hand, are inspired not only by their function but by cultural designs that have been passed down for centuries. Silver, pottery, woven goods, leatherwork, copper and tin ware are all uniquely Mexican materials and are worked into enduring art by local craftsmen.
<p>
Not only do Mexican artists and craftsmen get their  inspiration from a variety of sources, but they also combine new materials and design with the art of the past to produce original painting, sculpture, ceramics, weaving, and jewelry. The beauty of the Mexican countryside and the wealth of ancient design are their inspiration. Mexican artists inherit a long tradition of pride in workmanship, regional influences, boundless creativity and expression of unique views of the world.
<p>
With its multiple languages and rugged interior, Mexico developed as a nation of regions that still produce distinctive arts and crafts as well as cuisines and customs. Handicrafts flourish in every region, but central and southern Mexico are especially noted for the variety and sheer number of their artisans.
<p>
At their best, Mexican arts and crafts combine utility with imagination to express their creator's personal and cultural outlook. The first artifacts in Mexico were the weapons used for hunting and the baskets that carried personal goods and agricultural products. The use of fibers to create baskets began some 10,000 years ago. As division of labor allowed for surplus money and time, artisans competed to create goods that would appeal to the leisure classes. Weaving, basketmaking, carving, laquerware, jewelry and pottery were well-developed by the time the Spanish arrived with Cortes in 1519.
<p>
The Spanish brought new techniques and design ideas that the local population quickly adapted to create new art forms. The pottery wheel and high temperature pottery kiln added brilliance and durability to traditional clay crafts. European motifs combined with local religious and nature imagery to create the fantastic masks, statues and paintings so closely identified with modern Mexican art. New metalworking techniques led to today's highly regarded knife and tool making as well as to sculptures in brass and iron.
<p>
Most foreigners associate Mexican arts and crafts with just a few materials or products: cotton and wool rugs and blankets, onyx carvings or painted papier-mache animals, for example. In reality, the variety is endless. Eluding classification are the vanilla pods fashioned into tiny scorpions that perfume clothing drawers in Papantla; the silk rebozos  or shawls from San Luis Potos’ that are so finely woven they can slip through a wedding ring; the elaborately carved radishes of Oaxaca; or the nutshells carved into pigs in Guanajuato with eyes and tails that move when a live fly is added. 
<p>
<b>FINE ARTS</b>
<p>
Even after Mexico achieved independence from Spain, Mexican art tended to model itself on European style and follow European critical standards. This outlook changed in the 1930s, when such world-recognized artists as Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco, David Siqueiros, Frida Kahlo and Rufino Tamayo based their unique murals and other artwork on indigenous folk themes.
<p>
Today's fine art in Mexico strongly identifies itself with traditional national themes, colors and outlooks. One of Mexico's renowned contemporary artists, Sergio Bustamante, creates sculptures of fantastic human/animal forms, playing with the idea of inner and outer realities, much as Mexican masks have done for centuries. Bustamante, along with proteges like Mario Gonzales, has his home studio in Tlaquepaque. 
<p>
Traditional approaches can also be discerned in the works of sculptor Pedro Friedeburg, whose carved furniture--chairs in the shape of giant hands, tables shaped like huge carved butterflies--recalls works as diverse as Olmec giant heads and colorful ceramic trees of life.
<p>
In a world growing weary of contemporary abstractions, Mexican art refreshes with its connection to history, its playful spirit and its challenge to conventional reality. As with any fertile art scene, the mix of styles and the rise and decline of artists change daily. To stay on the cutting edge, explore the endless commercial galleries in Mexico City's Zona Rosa. 
<p>
The city's museums also present a good view of Mexico's evolving art, from pre-Hispanic to the present. Good starters are Mexico City's  Museo Rufino Tamayo, Bellas Artes or Palace of Fine Arts, Frida Kahlo Museum, Museum of Modern Art, Siqueiros Cultural Polyform and the National Museum of Culture. 
<p>
All of Mexico's major towns and cities offer comprehensive regionally and nationally oriented collections, as well as commercial galleries. Outstanding museums of Mexican contemporary art include the striking Museum of Monterrey, the Francisco Goit’a Museum in Zacatecas, as well as smaller but remarkable exhibits in Morelia and Oaxaca.
<p>
<b>CRAFTS</b>
<p>
<b>Masks</b>
<p>
Masks played an essential part in Mexico's religious and ceremonial life as far back as records are available. By donning the masks, dancers became the nature gods and spirits that controlled the rain, sun and wind as well as harvests and health. The identification of the gods with particular animals led to a profusion of jaguar, snake, lizard and other animal-visaged masks, often combined with human features. Later, masks portrayed Christian themes and recorded impressions of the Spanish conquerers.
<p>
Today's maskmakers retain traditional themes, but often add a contemporary twist to their creations. Masks are still used in local fiestas. Some lose their powers after one use and are discarded, while others are carefully put away to be handed down from generation to generation.
<p>
The three main maskmaking centers are the states of Guerrero, Oaxaca and Michoacan. Most typical of Guerrero are painted masks carved from wood and representing various animals including jaguars, scorpions, dogs, frogs and snakes. Some masks feature glass eyes and real animal bristles.
<p>
Oaxaca masks are often finely carved from wood and left unpainted. Others are made from animal skins and shells. Masks from Michoacan, less widely distributed, feature finely detailed wood representing saints and devils, old men and other traditional figures. The stunning range of Mexican masks is best studied in galleries and museums. Most art museums in Mexico display mask collections. The Museo Rafael Coronel in Zacatecas is an outstanding resource with its collection of thousands of Mexican masks ranging from antique to contemporary. There is also a Mask Museum at San Luis Potos’.
<p>
<b>Basketry</b>
<p>
Basketry, the oldest of crafts, is found all over Mexico. Using various reeds and grasses as well as henequen, a form of sisal, craftspeople fashion baskets for tortillas, produce, clothing and just about any other item that requires storage or transportation. Similar techniques produce henequen mats in Merida and small tule rugs in the Lake Patzcuaro area.
<p>
Mexico is justly famous for its hats, from the straw cowboy hats of Michoacan to the finely made "Panama" hats produced in Campeche. Other quality hats are found in Chiapas, Guerrero, and Nayarit.
<p>
<b>Pottery and Ceramics</b>
<p>
The most widely practiced, as well as one of the oldest, of Mexican crafts are poittery and ceramics. Pre-Columbian pottery abounds in Mexico's museums, and ancient shards still turn up daily in farm fields. The Spanish brought the high-firing kiln and the potter's wheel.  The majolica dishware the Spanish introduced is still produced in Puebla and Guanajuato and is considered among Mexico's finest. Oaxaca is the center for the black ceramics that have recently caught on with sophisticated collectors.
<p>
Ceramics are used for more than dishes, however. Metepec, about an hour west of Mexico City, is famous for Trees of Life and Trees of Death: fantastic elaborations of the simple candlestick, sometimes standing twelve feet tall or more and covered with birds, animals and plants (or skulls, skeletons and spirits). Other ceramic constructions include nativity scenes, satirical social tableaus and reproductions of pre-Columbian pottery.
<p>
<b>Weaving</b>
<p>
Next to pottery, the craft of weaving has been passed down for thousands of years. Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca, is a town famous for its wool rugs, which can be ordered in virtually any size. The more expensive rugs are dyed with natural substances to produce deep earthtones.
<p>
Other centers for the making of rugs, blankets and serapes include Patzcuaro, Guadalajara, San Miguel de Allende and Temoaya. Soft woolen white serapes are designed in Jocotepec, while brilliant multi-colored serapes from Saltillo capture the vibrancy and warmth of northern Mexico. The Huichols of the Yucatan Peninsula have long made colorful yarn wall hangings as tributes to the deities. Recently the pictures, made by pressing yarn into beeswax to create highly symbolic images, have been marketed to the public.
<p>
Hammocks are associated with southern Mexico, with those from the Yucatan Peninsula considered the finest. Oaxacan hammocks use a coarser fabric, and are somewhat less costly. Once made exclusively of cotton, hammocks today are also offered in nylon for lighter weight and easier maintenance.
<p>
<b>Musical Instruments</b>
<p>
Little has changed in musical instruments from pre-Columbian times to those used in Oaxaca and the Yucatan Peninsula today. Drums, flutes and rattles of clay and wood can still be found in the markets there. Later musical forms brought by Europeans led to a world-renowned cottage industry in modern instruments. Paracho, Michoacan, is famous for its fine guitars, mandolins and violins. Classical guitars can be found for as little as $50 or for more than $2000. Marimbas, introduced along with the slave trade, are made in Carranza, while harpmakers ply their trade in Mexico City, San Luis Potos’, Queretaro and throughout the State of Chiapas.
<p>
<b>Regional Craft Centers</b>
<p>
Art and craft works find their way to markets all over Mexico. Nonetheless, one of the thrills of travel is to buy that special piece where it was made. To get an idea of where to look, a visit to Mexico City's shops and museums will provide a miniature tour of the whole country. The Museo Nacional de Artes y Industrias Populares in Mexico City contains both an extensive folk art museum and a government-run art and craft shop. The museum features masks from around the country, ceramics, indigenous musical instruments and textiles, as well as special temporary exhibits devoted to one artist or style. The store offers a wide array of folk art for sale at moderate prices.
<p>
<b>Guadalajara</b>
<p>
This second-largest city in Mexico is the home of Mercado Libertad, the largest enclosed market in Latin America. There, more than 1,000 vendors sell local blown glass, sturdy huarache sandals, and a wide range of leather goods including handbags and charro goods such as saddles, reins and chaps. Two Casas de Las Artesan’ias include museums of works from the State of Jalisco as well as shops with goods for sale. 
<p>
Just outside the city limits, Tlaquepaque is a handicrafts center especially known for its hand-blown glass and ceramics. The Museo Regional de la Ceramica offers an impressive collection of works by master potters as well as Huichol art. The town is also one of the best places to buy handicrafts made in the region.
<p>
<b>Merida</b>
<p>
The capital of the State of Yucatan offers fine hammocks from Tixkokob and other nearby weaving centers. A state-run Casa also features "Panama" hats from several neighboring areas as well as embroidered clothing--the white cotton dresses known as huipils and the highly decorated men's dress shirts called guayaberas.
<p>
<b>Morelia</b>
<p>
The Spanish influence is most notable in the arts and crafts found in this handsome colonial city, the capital of Michoacan. The state-run Casa de Las Artesan’ias features museum pieces as well as sale items from Michoacan. An upstairs room features small stores run by people from nearby villages selling their local crafts: copperware from Santa Clara del Cobre, guitars from Paracho, pottery from Patamban and Capula and ceramic figures from Ocumicho, to name a few.
<p>
<b>Oaxaca</b>
<p>
Oaxaca is one of Mexico's largest and most varied states. Oaxaca City, its capital, reflects that diversity. Several large markets, including the Saturday Mercado de Abastos and the more tourist-oriented Mercado de Artesan’as offer a breathtaking array of local goods. Here shoppers will find the famous black clay pottery still made using pre-Columbian techniques that require no wheel, rugs and blankets handwoven from wool or cotton and either left natural or dyed in brilliant colors that echo age-old patterns, and basketry ranging from tiny miniatures to huge structures that could almost serve as auto garages. The markets and shops also offer Oaxacan wedding dresses and other handmade traditional clothing, as well as painted wooden animals and miniature dioramas (retablos), masks carved from local woods, and finely made machetes, swords and other knives. Oaxaca has enough stores and galleries offering local crafts to fill several shopping days. A visit to the FONART store is a good way to survey the range of Oaxaca goods and develop a sense of average prices.
<p>
<b>Puebla</b>
<p>
This beautiful old colonial city, 80 miles east of Mexico City, specializes in pottery made with the majolica technique--high fired with a tin glaze. Called Talavera, the pottery comes in many colors, especially the popular royal blue and white tiles, dishes and decorations. The technique, as well as the Arabian design motif, was introduced by the Spanish in the 1600s. Pottery workshops are open to visitors, but most retail selling goes on at the Mercado El Parian, where local onyx carvings, clothing, leathergoods, miniatures and other crafts are also for sale. The Museo Artesanal de Estado de Puebla has a large collection of art and crafts from all around the State of Puebla; it also sells pottery and other goods from its small store.
<p>
<b>San Miguel de Allende</b>
<p>
Set among the hills of central Mexico, this colonial town  has long been a haven for artists, musicians and retirees from around the world. Its local specialty is wrought iron and metalwork, including tin lamps, plates, trays, candelabras and picture frames and mirrors hammered by hand and often painted in bright, translucent colors or detailed with brass or copper. Local artisans also produce designer clothing, sophisticated leather accessories, wood carvings, glass boxes and silver filigree jewelry.
<p>
<b>Taxco</b>
<p>
The lovely colonial town of Taxco, a national historic monument, clings to a mountainside in central Mexico. Known as Mexico's silver center, Taxco has hundreds of shops selling handmade jewelry, frames, jewelry boxes and flatware. Semiprecious stones such as topaz, opals, garnets, turquoise and amethyst are offered in jewelry or individually. Sterling silver stamped with the number .925 is the most expensive, while alpaca, or "nickel silver," which contains no silver, costs the least. Casa Humboldt, the state-run store, is a good place to get an overview of silverware and other local crafts. The Spratling Museum features pre-Columbian artifacts and an exhibit on local silver mining and fabrication.
<p>
<b>Toluca</b>
<p>
About an hour west of Mexico City, Toluca draws craftspeople from nearby villages to sell their wares at the Friday market. Animal-shaped ceramic fireplaces from Acatlan, hand-knitted local wool sweaters, Temoaya hand-knotted rugs and ceramic trees of life from Metepec are among the regular offerings. A CASART store run by the State of Mexico offers goods from around the state and beyond. 
<p>
<b>Uruapan</b>
<p>
Uruapan, about 120 miles southeast of Guadalajara, is one of the places where the fine lacquerware or maque from fragrant, lemony linaloa wood is made. Lacquerware trays and boxes range in size from ring boxes to large trunks. Linens kept in these boxes acquire the fresh fragrance of the wood. The carved boxes are painted, etched with floral motifs, filled with color and polished to a brilliant finish. Olinala, in the State of Guerrero, is another major lacquerware center. There, several coats of paint are applied to the wood and a design is etched into the surface.
<p>
<b>PURCHASING ARTS AND CRAFTS</b>
<p>
Buying arts and crafts where they are produced affords many travelers with the prime motivation for visiting particular destinations. Each village specializes in a particular craft, but often it is not practical to travel to them to purchase their wares. 
<p>
A proliferation of national and state-sponsored specialty shops throughout Mexico has made it possible to see and buy artwork and crafts from almost anywhere. FONART stores, sponsored by the national government, may be found in most major tourism destinations. They often feature a representative sampling of popular folk art from many regions at reasonable fixed prices, though adept bargainers may find better deals at local markets. 
<p>
Many towns and cities in craft-producing regions have shops sponsored by local and state governments as well, often under the name of Casa de Las Artesan’ias. Since such stores seek to display the variety and quality of their region's works, they make excellent places to study the types of crafts available and to develop a sense of price ranges.

<center><font size=+2>THE MAGIC OF MEXICO'S COLONIAL CITIES</font></center>
<p>
Mexico's colonial cities are virtual living museums to a vanished way of life, gems in the mountains that have long delighted travelers yet defied them as well.  Until the dawn of jet travel, these cities were, for many people, simply too difficult to reach.  Then with the creation of luxurious beach resorts like Cancœn and Ixtapa, they were all but forgotten.  But not any more.
<p>
The charm of secluded courtyards, white walls accented by wrought iron balconies, red tile roofs gleaming in the sun and recessed windows guarded  by ornate metal filigrees make visits to Mexico's colonial cities a must.  These cities, built during the viceregal period are monuments to a gracious, yet unsettling age -- an age when greed drove men to search out riches, not for themselves, but for the glory of Spain.
<p>
Fortunes went into the building of churches in those pious days.  The shrines of Mexico City's Metropolitan Cathedral, the magnificent gilded altar of Oaxaca's Church of Santo Domingo, the carved pink stone facade of Taxco's Santa Prisca Church -- all are true works of art.
<p>
Guided by Franciscan and Jesuit fathers, Indian artisans seemed to do their best  work in Mexico's colonial cities.  Ornate towers on cathedrals, elaborate gold and silver ornamentation of church interiors, Churrigueresque-style statues of saints and cherubs hovering over the dark-skinned Virgin of Guadeloupe add more mystery and wonderment to the houses of worships of an already mysterious religion composed of European Catholic traditions and Indian superstitions.
<p>
From the beginning, most of the colonial cities were fine examples of urban planning.  Charles V ordered that each be rectangular shaped with a square at the center, intended to be the main square where the church should stand.  The center of action in all of Mexico's colonial cities today is the Plaza de Armas, or z—calo, and thus every town's plaza retained that name.
<p>
In the 300 years of Spanish domination, Mexico experienced an era of men on horseback and of feudalism more absolute than that of the Middle Ages in Europe.  But the record isn't all black.  As impressive as the pyramids and temples which the Spaniards pulled down, they made  at least partial restitution in decorating the country with extraordinarily impressive architecture of their own.  The Indians built it, but the Spaniards laid out the pattern.
<p>
The Colonial period was a time of fusion -- of indigenous and Spanish cultures.  Every phase of Mexican life was touched.  The result, Mexican culture today is neither Indian nor Spanish.  More than  450 years of interaction have created a synthesis, a mosaic which is Mexico, herself.  She has modified Castilian Spanish to her own softer tongue, even as the Yankee has modified the king's english.  She has created her own diet, her own piquant cookery, based on maize, the corn of the Indians.  She has combined church and market into her own fiesta. And  she has adapted Spanish ballads to the guitar-threaded corrido, full of news and satire.  The culture is drenched with surviving Aztec, Toltec, and Olmec elements mixed with imported Spanish one fully blended into a new compound.
<p>
Visitors to Mexico's colonial cities come for the spirit of history that pervades the cobblestone streets. It was here that the Spanish ordered construction of some of Mexico's most opulent buildings and squares.  It was here, too, that resistance to Spanish rule found voice and ultimately triumphed.  The struggle between Spain and the indigenous communities scattered among the Sierra Madre mountains left a heritage that defines modern Mexico.  Monuments to national heroes in the independence movement stand within sight of tributes to Spanish rulers.  To walk these historic streets is to retrace the steps in the birth of a nation.
<p>
Even visitors with minimal interest in the details of  history respond to the atmosphere that Mexico's colonial legacy created.  Silver mines brought great wealth to much of the region, financing the construction of fabulous Baroque churches, public buildings and estates.  Several colonial cities have been designated national historic sites in order to preserve their intricate colonial architecture, bright earthy colors and narrow cobblestone streets that wind  through downtown areas tucked between mountains or nestled atop high plateaus.
<p>
Just as the colonial cities offer a visual feast to culture and architecture buffs, they provide a cornucopia of treasures for shoppers.  Each city boasts its specialized artisans and serves as a market center for surrounding villages as well.  Markets in the Patzcuaro area, for example, overflow with world-class guitars from Paracho, famous copperware from Santa Clara de Cobre and dollhouse furniture from Quiroga.  San Miguel de Allende is nationally known for its elaborate tinware, and its markets display local wool rugs and blankets, silver jewelry and a stunning range of pottery styles.
<p>
Aside from their infinite attractions, part of the reason for the colonial cities' growing popularity is their accessibility.  Though determined to preserve its historic integrity and way of life, the region has managed to provide comfortable accommodations, whether in sleek new world-class hotels or in refurbished convents, monasteries or colonial haciendas.
<p>
Getting from city to city is easy and convenient.  Guadalajara, Aguascalientes and  Leon which also serves Guanajuato, Zacatecas and Uruapan are among the cities with regional airports.  Good roads open onto spectacular vistas.  Maps, itineraries and travel tips are widely available in Mexico City and each of the main colonial cities.  The American Automobile Association provides maps, a TravelBook and trip information to its members.  Guided tours ranging from three days to several weeks cover every interest and are offered by travel agents around the world.	
<p>
With 52 designated colonial cities to explore throughout Mexico, visitors can spend a lifetime and never run out of new discoveries.  The following is but a sampling of some of the most popular colonial cities.
<p>
<b>Veracruz</b>
<p>
Mexico's hot and sultry principal port principal city, and the nation's oldest, is much like pre-Castro Havana.  For many, Veracruz is synonymous with joie de vivre, the joy of life.  The atmosphere in this tropical port -- where the heat of summer is toned down by a constant seabreeze -- is relaxed and unhurried.
<p>
The city's exuberant inhabitants, call jarochos, are predominantly of Spanish descent.  They have their own traditional way of dancing, the son jarocho, with its many variations.  The stamping rhythm of the dancers contrasts with the rather monotonous accompaniment by the conjunto jaroch, a band consisting of harp, guitars, and sometimes violins.  La bamba is a vivacious, rhythmic dance song that proclaims that all anyone needs to dance is gracefulness.
<p>
Cafe life here is the best in Mexico, since Veracruz is the entry point for many European immigrants.  Each evening the zocalo is alive with marimba bands playing to the crowds sitting at the dozen of cafes that line the perimeter.  People come here to eat the local seafood.  Some play dominos,  while others munch on tropical fruit, sip rich coffee, and watch the people.  About six blocks from the zocalo, is the Mercado Hidalgo, where the butchers beat their knives on chopping blocks to Latin tunes and the witchcraft stalls are filled with potions.
<p>
It's worthwhile to walk along the malecon to watch the activity of the harbor.  Here boats depart for harbor cruises, which include a running commentary on port sights sung out by the guide like a sailor's chant.  Here, also, boats go to Castillo de San Juan de Ulua, a large island fortress built by the Spaniards in 1528 to protect the town from attack by sea.  Its bastions and parapets have shielded the town against pirates, French invaders and American troops, and its interior is filled with eroded stairs, dungeon-like rooms, cobbled plazas and arched breezeways.
<p>
<b>Mexico City</b>
<p>
If Veracruz is Mexico's oldest colonial city, then Mexico City, known affectionately by residents as Mexico, is its grandest.  From the rubble of what had been the capital of the Aztecs, Cortes ordered the building of a new city along Spanish lines.  Within three centuries, Mexico City became the greatest metropolis in the Western Hemisphere, home of the first mint in the New World, the first printing press, and the first university.  During the past decade, massive urban renewal has restored the luster to what is called the Historic Center of Mexico.
<p>
Center of the Center is the Plaza de la Constitucion or z—calo, the largest square in the Americas.  Here on one side stands the Metropolitan Cathedral, the largest cathedral in Mexico, begun in the late 1500s.  Next to it are the ruins of the Templo Mayor, or Great Temple, of the Aztecs.  Many of the stone carvings are in remarkably good condition, such as the reclining statue of Chac-Mool, said to be the messenger whose task it was to take gifts to the sun.
<p>
On another side stands the National Palace, office building for the presidency, as it once had been for the viceroys.  Dating back to the time of Cortes, it contains a Diego Rivera mural over the main staircase depicting much of Mexico's history.
<p>
Of the many religious structures in the neighborhood--convents, monasteries and churches--perhaps the most impressive is the former headquarters of the Holy Office, the Spanish Inquisition on Garabaldi Square  In its day, it was both prison and courthouse for the wicked and the unlucky.  Later the edifice housed the National School of Medicine and is now a medical museum.
<p>
Reminders of the colonial era can be found all over the city, from the Plaza of the Three Cultures (pre-Hispanic, colonial and modern), to San Angel, a charming neighborhood in the southern part of  town.  Here, cobbled streets shaded by ancient cyprus trees make the noisy metropolis seem far away. The Bazar Sabado, a handicraft market held only on Saturdays, fills the main square with fine works of art and crafts.
<p>
<b>Guadaljara</b>
<p>
Mexico's second largest city, Guadalajara is also one of its most progressive and a center of business and industry.  The traditional heart of the city, the Metropolitan Zone, where many of the buildings are 400 years old, has been completely renewed in recent years.  In an area now closed to automobile traffic, new plazas have been opened and existing ones expanded.
<p>
Dominating it all is the Guadalajara Cathedral, begun in 1561 and topped off centuries later by a pair of Byzantine bell towers rather unlike others in Mexico.  The Government Palace, Jalisco Supreme Court (Guadalajara is the capital of the State of Jalisco) and Legislative Hall all look out on the Plaza of the Three Powers
<p>
Close by is Libertad Market, one of the largest public markets in the world, and the Mariachi Plaza, a great place to stop for a cold beer and hear the musicians play music that was born here.  Guadalajara also claims honors for creating the quintessentially Mexican hat dance as well as the charreada, the Mexican rodeo.
<p>
One of the best-loved landmarks, the old Caba–a Orphange, has been converted into the Caba–as Institute, a center for the arts.  It houses a mural by Jose Clemente Orozco called "Man of Fire." Tapatiios, as the people of Jalisco call themselves, maintain the fresco is one of the most dramatic works of art in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
Nearby, endless fields of cactus-like blue agave lead the way to the town of Tequila, which shares its name with the drink that is yet another Guadalajara innovation.  Several distilleries in Guadalajara and Tequila offer tours and tastings.
<p>
The towns of Tlaquepaque and Tonala, now part of metro Guadalajara, are famous for their hand-blown glass and painted ceramics, but sell a wide variety of quality arts and crafts items.  Tonala has a huge street market for handicrafts every Thursday and Sunday.
<p>
Another worthwhile side trip from Guadalajara is the Lake Chapala area.  The shores of this second-largest lake in Mexico have long attracted an international set of artists and writers, and today host the largest colony of resident norteamericanos outside the United States and Canada especially at the little village of Ajijic.
<p>
<b>Dolores Hidalgo</b>
<p>
Dolores Hidalgo is the first stop on Mexico's Independence trail that traces the course of the revolution against Spain.  From here the trail continues to San Miguel de Allende, Queretaro, Guanajuato and Morelia.  It was from Dolores Hidalgo that the Grito de Dolores, or shout for independence, echoed across the nation, and where on September 16, 1810, the Mexican Revolution was born.
<p>
Father Miguel Hildalgo, the parochial priest who proclaimed the grito, first gathered his troops on that fateful day, and the town was later named in his honor.  The house where he lived from 1804 until 1810 is open to the public and displays many of his personal effects, as well as documents from that era.  The Parroquia where he first shouted for independence has also been preserved.  A bronze statue of Hidalgo stands in the town square.  Dolores Hidalgo's artisans make and sell quality wood furniture and colorful ceramics, including unique tiles.
<p>
<b>San Miguel de Allende</b>
<p>
San Miguel de Allende's bright colors and languorous atmosphere make it the most typically "Mexican" of the colonial cities.  Smaller than most, it's become a cultural and educational center and has been declared a national monument by the Mexican Institute of History and Anthropology.
<p>
Renamed for native son Ignacio Allende, second in command of the independence army, it's clear light and agreeable temperature have long made it a favorite American artist colony.  Founded in 1542, San Miguel de Allende is picturesque with cafes, galleries, and shops lining cobblestone streets.  Dominating the zocalo is a 17th-century church, La Parroquia, topped by a pink tower that seems gothic, but actually was created out of the imagination of a local Indian, Zeferino Gutierrez, who, in the 19th century, scratched his "blueprints" in the sand with a stick.
<p>
With six patron saints, San Miguel offers many delights for the traveler.  Its multitude of churches ensures a roster of joyous and unique fiestas.  Also, it offers an abundance of local handicrafts.  Brass and tin shine brightly,  but locally hand-woven fabrics and well designed jewelry can also be found in shops occupying colonial buildings surrounding the square.
<p>
The nearby shrine of Atotonilco was the first stopping place of the independence army after it left Dolores.  The banner of the Virgin of Guadeloupe was flown here by Hidalgo and Allende; this patron saint of the nation's indigenous people continues to be the symbol of freedom.
<p>
Today, cafes, galleries and shops line cobblestone streets and the zocalo in the center of the city.  San Miguel de Allende is both an artists' and writers' colony and retirement home for many U.S. and Canadian residents.  Towering over the zocalo is a 17th century gothic church which can be seen from any point in the city's surrounding hills.  The town is filled with churches, and, with a holiday for each of its six patron saints, San Miguel is a year-round fiesta haven.  The nearby hot springs of La Gruta offer thermal bathing pools located inside a cave.
<p>
<b>Queretaro</b>
<p>
Less than a three-hour drive north of Mexico City, Queretaro, capital of the state of the same name, is a monument to the colonial past.  Best known of its many fine colonial structures and the symbol of the city, is the aqueduct, which was  built between 1726 and 1735 on the order of the Marquis de las Villa del Villar de Aquila, whose statue stands in the square fronting the City Hall.
<p>
Many aristocrats built their homes here, among them the counts of Ecala, whose palace is named the House of Dogs because of the many canine sculptures inside and out.  Other baroque homes, such as that of Francisco Antonio de Alday, have been converted into hotels and restaurants.
<p>
One of Mexico's most historic cities, Queretaro played a decisive role in Mexico's struggle for independence.  Here the first plans were laid in 1810.  In the City Hall overlooking  a charming square, the governor's wife, Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez, warned conspirators that a plot to proclaim independence from Spain was discovered.  That encouraged Father Hidalgo to quickly make his declaration and bring his army together.
<p>
Fifty years later the Mexican Republic was reborn in Queretaro.  It was here that Maxmillian, an Austrian archduke who tried to become emperor, was defeated and executed.  A monument on Cerro de las Campanas (Hills of the Bells), despite its pretty name, marks the spot where he fell.  The Teatro de la Republica (Theater of the Republic) saw the writing of much of the Constitution of 1917.
<p>
Churches and convents dot the town, each with its own particular charm; most contain patios, flowery arches and elegant stairways.  At the Federal Palace, a former monastery, gargoyle statues that leer from walls supposedly utter the Ave Maria in sign language.
<p>
For those who enjoy shopping, this colonial city is known as the opal-mining center of Mexico.  Other semi-precious stones are also available.  Short excursions outside the city will bring visitors to San Juan del Rio, know for its stone-cutting and basketry, and to Tequisquiapan, a spa resort with thermal baths and a variety of handicrafts.
<p>
<b>Guanajuato</b>
<p>
The most splendid of Mexico's colonial silver towns is Guanajuato, tucked into the hills about a six-hour drive northwest of Mexico City.  During the viceregal era, the mines of Guanajuato were the most productive of all and many reminders of the riches of the past remain.
<p>
Guanajuato, unlike other Mexican cities, is truly a bit of Old Spain in Mexico.  Reminiscent of Toledo or Segovia, it's a maze of corkscrew lanes that blossom into plazas or fade into alleys or staircases.  Churches abound.  Mine owners, seeking to outdo each other, built these temples to God as a way of seeking the esteem of their peers and the blessing of the Church.  La Valenciana Church, built in 1788, was said to have been constructed of mortar mixed with wine and silver.  The university is even older, opening in 1732
<p>
University students, on a lark, would dress up in medieval Spanish costume and perform one-act plays by Miguel de Cervantes, author of "Don Quixote," on street corners that seemed designed as theatrical sets.  The custom gave birth to the annual Festival Cervantino, Mexico's major art fiesta, held in October.
<p>
Guanajuato is also where one of the first great battles of Mexico's War for Independence was fought.  The battle raged at the Alh—ndiga de Granaditas, a massive granary in which the royalists sought refuge and now one of the town's principal sights.
<p>
Built between hills upon a ravine and a river, Guanajuato is a maze of streets and alleys that wind around hillsides, opening into vistas of  brightly painted houses and beautiful small plazas.
<p>
These romantic passageways are largely traffic-free, since the city thoroughfares run underground in a unique tunnel system.  Tunnels, avenues and cross-town roads wind past the basements of old buildings, suddenly emerging into a shady square or lively side street.  The odd layout, and the cobblestone streets, plazas and flower gardens that dot the city are what give Guanajuato its quaint romantic atmosphere.  Some alleys are so narrow that--as in the legend of the Callejon de Beso--lovers in opposite houses can lean over and kiss.
<p>
Guanajuato is made for walking; every tiny side street seems to lead to pocket gardens, quaint houses or impressive old buildings and monuments.  Among the highlights are the Jardin  de la Uni—n, an elegant park ringed with cozy outdoor cafes; Alh—ndiga de Granaditas, a granary that became a fortress during the Independence Movement, and is now a stirring historical museum; the Muse de Diego Rivera, birthplace of the famed muralist, now filled with a comprehensive  collection of his work; and the Pantheon, or Mummy Museum, where departed Guanajuato residents are on display, preserved by the town's dry atmosphere and the unique chemistry of its soil.
<p>
Other must-see sites include The Natural History Museum, the Mineralogy Museum and the former Hacienda of San Gabriel de Barrera, with its outstanding art and furniture collections.  For determined walkers, a 10-minute climb up the steps to the El Pipila monument  ends at a huge statue of the Independence hero and affords a breathtaking view of the city.
<p>
But more than sightseeing, Guanajuato offers lots of atmosphere.  It's great for strolling and wandering, a marvelous place to contemplate Mexico as it once was and, in many ways, still is.
<p>
<b>Morelia</b>
<p>
Located in the heart of the colonial highlands about a six-hour drive northwest of Mexico City, Morelia, capital of the state of Michoacan, has a unique air to it.  The city, itself, takes its name from Jose Maria Morelos, a priest born there who became a leader in the War for Independence.  This is Mexico at its provincial best, more subdued than the tropics and, in its own way, quite regal.
<p>
A romantic plaza, lovely colonial buildings, exhilarating climate and wide boulevards have earned it a UNESCO designation as a World Heritage Artistic Site and a reputation as the aristocrat among colonial cities.  Surrounding the city are pine forests, waterfalls, steep mountainsides and thousands of small villages.
<p>
The Baroque-style cathedral, begun in 1640, overlooking Morelia's central square is considered one of Mexico's finest church buildings.  Its 200-foot earthtone-colored spires are the tallest in Mexico, and its magnificent pipe organ has been called one of the finest in the Americas.
<p>
The regional museum, located in a former monastery, pays tribute to the nation's indigenous artists.  Each room is devoted to handicrafts from a different region in Mexico.  The Museo Michoacan, an impressive 18th-century palace, houses an exhibit tracing the history of Mexico through 1940.  As the capital of one of Mexico's prime crafts regions, Morelia is a shoppers' paradise.  A good place to start is the Casa de Artesanias in the former Convent of San Francisco.
<p>
Morelia's historic importance is reflected in its name, which was changed in 1828 from Valladolid to Morelia in honor of its son and revolutionary leader, Father Jose Maria Morelos.   The priest continued the fight for independence after the deaths of Hidalgo and Allende.  The house in which Morelos was born is now a museum and cultural center.  As the capital of one of Mexico's most diverse states and home of the Colegio de San Nicolas, the oldest university in the Americas, Morelia is home to many writers, artists, philosophers and poets, who frequent its many cafes.
<p>
During the colonial era, Spanish monks encouraged the development of folk art in the various towns of Michoacan.  Many of these communities today are nationally famous for their products--textiles, lacquerware, guitars, copper utensils, furniture, and pottery.
<p>
<b>Patzcuaro</b>
<p>
Only an hour's drive southwest from Morelia, Patzcuaro is a world away.  Set on the shore of a majestic lake of the same name, Patzcuaro is the center of the ancient Kingdom of the Taracans, a people the Aztecs never conquered.  Brooding churches shadow its narrow streets, great trees shade its plazas and somehow it always is a bit chilly.  This is a wonderful place to enjoy real Mexican hot chocolate or the tortilla soup for which the region is famous.
<p>
The original San Nicolas College building, built in the 1500s, is now a museum displaying local crafts such as intricate masks, lacquerware, ceramic dishes and hand-woven textiles.
<p>
Another recycled building, the House of the Eleven Patios, is an 18th-century convent that now houses shops offering an outstanding array of the work of local artisans.
<p>
Nearby Lake Patzcuaro is one of the most-photographed spots in Mexico.  Visitors often venture over to Janitzio, an island in the middle of the lake.  The island is a Tarascan fishing village from which fisherman go forth in their dugouts, with nets resembling butterfly wings, in pursuit of the tasty whitefish served by local restaurants.
<p>
<b>Puebla</b>
<p>
Puebla is a city of churches.  Unlike others founded on silver, it was laid out as a rest and recuperation stop for travelers making the arduous journey from Mexico City to the port of Veracruz, its link with Spain.  Today, that journey, far from being arduous, is delightfully scenic, and the high point of such a trip is a stop in Puebla.
<p>
Although convents and monasteries were outlawed here during the anti-clerical administration of President Benito Juarez, one survived.  The Secret Convent of Santa Monica, founded in colonial times, went underground, so to speak, in the wake of the anti-clerical laws.  Nuns, treading silently on tip-toe, moved through hidden passages and unmarked doors.  Attending mass unseen behind screens, they occupied many rooms, including a basement crypt, for few of the young women who entered Santa Monica ever left it.
<p>
In contrast, the convent of Santa Rosa, is a shrine to Mexican cuisine.  Its great tiled kitchen, with its immense earthenware casseroles and stewpots, is now a museum to the 18th century way of life and to hearty eating.  Supposedly, it was in this kitchen that mole poblano--chicken in a rich, spicy, unsweetened chocolate sauce--was first prepared for a colonial bishop.
<p>
Puebla is also known as la cuidad de azulejos, the city of tiles.  Many of its early settlers were artisans from Spain, primarily tilemakers.  Their descendants still follow this trade.  Tile is seen everywhere, from the covering of church domes to the facades of houses and on little patio fountains within.  Tile is also a favorite souvenir item, as is Talavera pottery, made from the same type of clay and decorated in the same bright tile colors and designs.
<p>
Despite Puebla's size--it's one of the largest cities in Mexico--its old-fashioned charm pervades all.  There's always time to stop for a cafe con leche, coffee and milk served in a glass, at one of the sidewalk cafes beneath the arcade that's across from the main plaza with its magnificent Cathedral, completed in 1665.
<p>
<b>Taxco</b>
<p>
A story is told of how a wandering Frenchman, who later changed his name to Jose de la Broda, slipped from his saddle while riding near Taxco and fell into one of the world's richest silver veins.  His discovery made tiny Taxco rich, as similar discoveries made the towns of San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas, and Aguascalientes wealthy from the mining of silver.
<p>
Today, silver shops outnumber grocery or drug stores.  There are said to be more that 100 in Taxco, along with stores selling imaginative work in tin and brass.  Yet it's the town's colonial charm that really attracts visitors.  So magic is its spell, that Taxco has been declared a national monument--not a cobble may be upturned without bureaucratic permission.
<p>
<b>San Luis Potosi</b>
<p>
Another silver center, San Luis Potosi, is also a colonial gem.  This 400-year-old city offers narrow streets and flower-filled boulevards that reflect centuries of dramatic history.
<p>
Like many of Mexico's colonial centers, San Luis began as a mining town.  The "Potosi" in its name is South American, a Quechua Indian word meaning extremely wealthy.  At the same  time as the Spaniards were building up Mexico, there was a Potosi mine in what is now Bolivia.  The miners of San Luis, not be outdone, boasted that their mines were every bit as rich.
<p>
As with other colonial towns, the center of activity is the zocalo, or as it's known here, the Jardiin Hidalgo.  The Cathedral, completed in 1737, and the Government Palace, finished in 1770, are highlights, as is the Municipal Palace, originally the Count of Monterrey's residence.
<p>
The main shopping street, the tile-paved Calle Hidalgo, is lined with shops selling silk rebozos, or shawls, made in the area.  It's said that the best are so fine that they can be drawn through a wedding ring.
<p>
<b>Aguascalientes</b>
<p>
Although its name means "Hot Waters" and there are indeed thermal springs in the area, it was silver that put Aguascalientes on the map.  The stately residence of the local mining baron, the Marquis de Guadeloupe, is now the Government Palace, office of the governor of the tiny state of Aguascalientes.
<p>
Aguascalientes is a city of parks.  Here, due to the fine weather, many fiestas are held throughout the year.  The San Marcos Park, site of the annual San Marcos Fair each spring, is especially attractive.  One of Mexico's grandest fiestas, it features cockfights, rodeos, bullfights, and lots of dancing.  Those who miss is make a point of taking in the Grape Festival in late July.  This festival is held here because Aguascalientes is one of Mexico's largest wine producing areas.  It's also noted for its fighting bulls.  Visits to both bull-breeding ranches and wineries are easily arranged.
<p>
As far as crafts are concerned,  hand-embroidered fabrics and crocheted pieces are a favorite with shoppers.  And for those who wish to take in the hot waters, there are several fine spas in the region.
<p>
<b>Zacatecas</b>
<p>
Wedged into a narrow gorge at an altitude of over 7,000 feet, a six-hour drive from Guadalajara, Zacatecas is one of Mexico's highest colonial cities.  Although smaller than some of the others, it contains some of the country's finest and best preserved examples of colonial architecture.  
<p>
Many of these buildings owe their existence to the silver boom, creating the wealth that built extravagant haciendas, public buildings and churches, often with the deep red local sandstone that gives Zacatecas its unique look.  More than a billion dollars' worth of silver was mined in here during the colonial period.  It still produces silver, but the free-spending miners of old made Zacatecas the marvel of a city that it is today.
<p>
The town cathedral is considered one of the most spectacular examples of Mexican Baroque architecture.  Its intricately carved exterior carries a story: the sculptor, so it's said, was under sentence of death by Spanish authorities.  He persuaded them to allow him time to finish the church, and by the time he'd shaped virtually every square inch of the facade, his sentence was decades old and long forgotten.
<p>
Another extraordinary feat is the city aqueduct, consisting of 39 high arches hand-carved out of sandstone.  The aqueduct, and the rest of Zacatecas, is best viewed from the mountaintop called Cerro de Bufa, reached by a Swiss-built cablecar suspended from hilltops at either end of the city.
<p>
The other legacy of Zacatecas' silver wealth is its extraordinary concentration of artists and intellectuals for a town its size.  Home to such national figures as the painters Raphael and Pedro Coronel and Francisco Goita, the city is rich with outstanding museums and cultural treasures.  The Raphael Coronel Museum features local and international artists including Picasso, Goya, Chagall, Miro and Dali.  A wealth of other museums demand several days just to get an overview of their treasures.
<p>
<b>Merida</b>
<p>
Of all the colonial cities, one, without a doubt, distinguishes itself above the rest.  Merida on the northern shore of the Yucatan peninsula, though far from most of the others, still retains a sophisticated charm that's earned it the title  "Paris of the West."  
<p>
In 1542, Francisco de Montejo y Le—n, nicknamed The Lad, founded Merida, which until then had been the Mayan city of T'ho.  Because of the color of the stone used in most of its buildings, as well as its clean streets and avenues, it was soon christened "The White City."
<p>
On one side of the main square, the Plaza de la Independencia, stands the cathedral, a Roman-style stone structure, completed in 1598 and considered to be the oldest in the Americas.  Like its European counterparts, it's built on water, with its southern tower built over a cenote or natural underground reservoir.  According to local history, the whites of millions of bird's eggs were used to laying its stones.
<p>
On the south side of the square is the Casa de Montejo, the former residence of founder Francisco de Montejo.  Its original portico, built in the plateresque, ornate Spanish style and bearing the coat of arms of the Montejo family, still remains.
<p>
Merida has many parks and gardens, all essential to the lifestyle here.  Each sets a festive mood every day.  Every Tuesday in Santiago Park, for example, a show is presented called Musical Souvenirs in which different groups play dance music from years gone by.  On Wednesday in Santa Ana Park, a popular concert, featuring Spanish operettas, overtures, and works of Yucatan composers, is performed for passersby.  And on Fridays, a romantic evening, with marimbas, poets, and bohemian love ballads, is held in the inner garden of the Santa Isabel Hermitage.
<p>
Since Merida is one of the hottest cities in the country, residents and visitors like to be outdoors in the cool of the evening.  Many stop by outdoor cafes for a champola, a refreshing tropical fruit milkshake.  Another favorite is the variety of exotic fruits available here.  Native women offer those out on an evening stroll luscious huayas, tamarinds, sapodilla, and mangoes.  But the most refreshing are the raspodos, crushed ice with fruit juice, especially the barley one.  Nothing in the whole world can match it!
<p>
While there are many similarities among Mexico's colonial cities, each offers an atmosphere, culture, and handicrafts that sets it apart from its sisters.  To sample a few is magic; to sample them all is heaven.

<center><font size=+2>MEXICO'S BAJA CALIFORNIA--A WORLD APART</font></center>
<p>
The Baja Peninsula is a world apart. Running 876 miles from Mexico's Southern California border to its tip at Los Cabos, it is a land of desert and semidesert separating the Pacific Ocean from the Sea of CortŽs.
<p>
For centuries, small groups of Indians lived in isolation, visiting each other by foot along the shore or by boat. Jesuit missionaries built the first missions and taught the Indians to farmand to plant vineyards, olive trees, and date palms.
<p>
Until 1973, its secrets were safe with the few adventurers who were willing to risk the severity of the terrain for the pleasure of hunting, fishing, rock hunting, fossil collecting, bird watching and surfing in an almost pure natural environment. That's when the 1,050-mile Transpeninsular Highway, officially called the Benito Juarez Highway, opened.
<p>
With a 800-mile plus coast on the Pacific and the Sea of CortŽs (also known as the Gulf of California), the Baja is a paradise for anglers, swimmers and surfers. Its beaches are laden with huge clams and oysters and the emerald-green waters of the gulf and the deep-blue waters of the Pacific support an incredible variety of big-game fish. California gray whales mate and calve every winter along the west coast. As the highway traverses the Baja, the dry landscape breaks into sudden oases, while the coast is dotted with fishing villages. With the highway came hotels and resorts and some villages became cities overnight.
<p>
The peninsula, which broke off from mainland Mexico millions of years ago due to a shift in the San Andresa fault, is made up mostly of mountains and desert. Whole forests of majestic cardon cactui, spiky joshua trees, ocotillo bushes and the boojum tree,  which is found nowhere else in the world, populate the landscape.
<p>
Baja California also has some of the most beautiful beaches in Mexico, many fairly isolated while others are lined with trailers and recreational vehicles. The area is particulary popular with travelers from the West Coast, although it is attracting an increasing number of U.S., Canadian and Japanese visitors, who find some of the world's most challenging golf courses here.
<p>
The Tranpeninsular Highway links Tijuana and Cabo San Lucas, passing through all the major towns enroute--Ensenada, San Quintin, Guerrero Negro, San Ignacio, Santa Rosalia, Mulege, Loreto, and La Paz. From Tijuana to Ensenada, the highway is a divided toll road, but upon leaving Ensenada, it narrows down to a two-lane, two-way road that, although in good condition, is not recommended for night driving. The route is patrolled by the Green Angels, a car and emergency aid corps of the Mexican Tourist Department. They speak  English well, and their service is free. 
<p>
Despite the land's wild nature and seeming remoteness, Baja California has experienced a tremendous surge in construction, especially in Los Cabos. In the 1980s, Los Cabos became a government-sponsored and planned FONATUR (the Mexican Ministry of Tourism's investment arm) resort, with expansion continuing throughout this decade. A crop of new hotels and golf courses make Los Cabos an internationally acclaimed destination for the more than 300,000 travelers that vacation there each year.
<p>
The following is a sampling of Baja resorts and towns from Tijuana to Los Cabos:
<p>
<b>Tijuana</b>
<p>
Tijuana, with more than 40 million border crossings per year, has the highest transient population of any border town in the world. As Mexico's fourth largest city with a population of over one million, the city is becoming a convention center known for its cultural attractions.
<p>
Formerly a bawdy, lusty place, it has cleaned up its act and now caters mostly to families. It is a prosperous city with the highest per capita income in Mexico. Since Baja California is a free zone, the shops of this city are its main attraction.
<p>
For fun, there are dog races five nights a week, horse races on Saturday, and Sunday afternoons, bullfights every Sunday afternoon during the spring and summer, and jai alai games every night but Thursday. Eating is also a favorite pasttime. Nighttime action centers around the many discos. Unfortunately, Tijuana is  the most unattractive city in Mexico. 
<p>
Many of the city's cultural activities center around "Rio Tijuana" a thriving area which includes a theater, museum, shops and a cafe. The Tijuana Cultural Center features a sight-and-sound show on Mexico.
<p>
Horse and dog racing, jai alai and bullfighting are also popular attractions. Agua Caliente Racetrack holds dog races several nights a week and horse races on weekends. Visitors can place a bet at the Jai Alai Palace, and watch bullfights from May through September at the Plaza Monumental and Toreo de Tijuana bull rings. Another popular attraction is Mexitl‡n, a 3.4 acre park featuring 150 scale models of Mexico's most famous sites.
<p>
<b>Rosarito</b>
<p>
Just a 20-mile trip from Tijuana, Rosarito is a popular vacation home for many Californians. While the main street is packed with restaurants, bars and shops, Rosarito remains a relaxing place to visit and typically draws a varied crowd. Surfers, swimmers and sunbathers come here to enjoy the beach, one of the longest stretches in northern Baja California. Horseback riding is popular here, and horses can be rented at the north south ends of Juarez and on the beach.
<p>
Quality home furnishing are the speciality in Rosarito, where stores sell custom-made furniture, carved wood, glass, ceramic tiles and rustic leather and wood chairs called equipales.
<p>
<b>Ensenada</b>
<p>
A charming town on Bahia de Todos Santos (All Saints Bay), Ensenada lies just south of Tijuana. Known for its sport and commercial fishing, it is a popular weekend destination for Southern Californians seeking a retreat from the everyday hustle and bustle. 
<p>
This town of 130,000 is mild in winter and cool in summer. Its malecon is a pleasant promenade. On the southern outskirts of town is La Bufadora (the Buffalo Snort), a big, hollow, cave-like rock through which the ocean penetrates to make a blowhole, roaring and spouting water high into the air.
<p>
Lobster is the specialty of most restaurants here, but tacos are also popular. There's also a varied and active nightlife, including discos and nightclubs.
<p>
Ensenada, like the rest of the peninsula is a duty-free zone and its prices are competitive. Fishing boats leave the Ensenada Sportfishing Pier throughout the day. Charter vessels and party boats are available from several outfitters along Avenida Lopez Mateos, Boulevard Costera, and off the Sportfishing Pier. Places to explore include the Bodegas de Santo Tomas winery, the open-air fish market, and the geyser on Punta Banda. Most of Ensenada's attractions are situated within five blocks of the waterfront, making it easy to take a walking tour of the city.
<p>
<b>San Quintin to Mulege</b>
<p>
Below Ensenada is San Quintin, a small agricultural town in a fertile valley. The highway parallels the ocean and many small side roads lead to the beach. Guerrero Negro, known for whale watching, is below San Quintin and the village of Rosario. The whales can be seen in Scammon's Lagoon, in Bahia de Sebastian Vizcaino (Sebastian Vizcaino Bay), from the last week in December to the first week of April. Besides Scammon's Lagoon, the whales take refuge in the adjoining Laguna de Guerrero Negro (Guerrero Negro Lagoon) and the nearby Laguna de San Ignacio (San Ignacio Lagoon).
<p>
San Ignacio, an oasis 80 miles across sun-baked desert from Guerrero Negro, is shaded by date palms. Like many other towns in Baja Sur, San Ignacio began as a Jesuit mission, established in 1716. The mission at the heart of town is well preserved and faces a little plaza shaded by huge trees.
<p>
The climate is considerably cooler than that of other Baja California towns, and is a good starting place for exploring the region's painted caves. Most caves are difficult to get to and sometimes require an overnight stay. The Hotel la Posada can arrange excursions to the caves, as well as whale watching trips between January and March, when whales migrate to Laguna San Ignacio near San Ignacio.
<p>
Below San Ignacio is Santa Rosalia, a unique mining town that resembles a town in the Old West. Rows of pastel wooden houses with matching picket fences line the bustling streets of Santa Rosalia. Founded by the French in 1855, Santa Rosalia has retained the charm of its European heritage and even bakes the best bread in Baja California. The centerpiece of the town is its tiny church, the Iglesia de Santa Barbara, (According to Birnbaum's this is the name of this church) a galvanized structure transported section by section from Europe, designed by Gustave Eiffel of France in 1884.
<p>
Several miles south of Santa Rosalia, a side road leads to the Caves of San Borjita, site of the oldest cave paintings found in Baja. The Mision de Santa Rosalia Church, founded by the Jesuits, is actually located in Mulege (pronounced moo-lay-hay), a lush green town at the mouth of the Santa Rosalia River. Dense groves of palm trees are plentiful and mangrove thickets edge its lazy riverbed. 
<p>
Guided expeditions to see ancient petroglyphs and cave paintings are available near San Baltazar, San Patricio or Trinidad. The San Borjita cave is one of the oldest regions caverns and requires a guide with a sturdy vehicle to locate and get to know the cave. 
<p>
<b>Loreto</b>
<p>
Loreto is the first of the "new" Baja resorts. Founded in 1697 by the Jesuits as the site for the first mission in the Californias, it was the headquarters of the presidio (regional government) until 1829, when it was transferred to San Antonio. 
<p>
The original Mision de Nuestra Senora de Loreto, in the heart of town, was severely damaged by earthquakes and has been almost completely rebuilt. The Museo de las Misiones Californias, next to the mission, was organized by the Mexico City Museum of Anthropology and History and offers a fine exhibit of artifacts and manuscripts related to old mission days. Boat excursions can be made to Isla Coronado (Coronado Island) in the Sea of CortŽs, which is inhabited by a large colony of sea lions.
<p>
<b>La Paz</b>
<p>
La Paz, meaning "peace" in Spanish, the capital of Baja Sur, with a population of 150,000, is located on a deep inlet in the La Paz Bay on the Sea of Cortes. It is protected from the bay by a long sand bar called El Mogote. 
<p>
For more than  400 years, La Paz has been known for the black and pink pearls that have been discovered there. However, today, the city survives more from commercial and sport fishing. Founded in 1720 by the Jesuits, who built the mission Nuestra Senora de la Paz, the town is a quiet and peaceful place.
<p>
The city has a provincial atmosphere, with its colonial buildings set amidst Indian laurel trees and coconut and date palms. The Sea of Cortes can be seen from every point in town, and at sunset, it often appears red, thus its other name, the Vermillion Sea.
<p>
The malecon (seaside promenade) is a place for strolling. Above it on a hill is the main plaza and a cathedral built in 1861. The Government Palace, a modern structure, stands nearby.
<p>
Like other resorts along the northern Pacific coast, La Paz is known for the myriad of game fish in its waters. Charters can be arranged through any of the leading hotels. It is also ideal for water sports, especially scuba, jet skiing, and water skiing.
<p>
One of the city's greatest attractions is shopping. As with other Baja towns, La Paz is a duty-free port and all varieties of imported goods are available.
<p>
<b>Los Cabos</b>
<p>
Below La Paz on the way to the tip of the peninsula is the semitropical town of San Jose del Cabo, population 10,000, an agricultural and cattle-raising community surrounded by fields of mango, avocado, and orange trees. The town's House of Culture has a museum and library, and the old church next to the plaza stands on the site previously occupied by the mission. The Paseo Mijares, with its stone arches and white cottages full of flowers, is a lovely place to stroll.
<p>
San Jose del Cabo, which is rapidly becoming more developed, retains the air of a typical Mexican village and is the more sedate of the two "Cabos." One- and two-story pastel buildings crowd the narrow streets and provide an authentic Mexican flavor.
<p>
Visitors to this quaint town can relax, birdwatch, ride horses, play golf or shop for such unique items as hand-painted shoes or clothing and Mexican handicrafts. The nearest swimming beach is Playa Pueblo la Playa, also called La Playita, located about two miles east of town. Local fishermen take visitors deep-sea fishing there, as does the fleet at the Hotel Palmilla. Playa Palmilla, another good swimming beach with beautiful rock formations, is located five miles west of San Jose near the Hotel Palmilla.
<p>
The Baja's deluxe resorts are found in Cabo San Lucas and the 18-mile corridor that connects it with San Jose del Cabo. This town is a major tourist center and there are many fine hotels, although everything is spread out.
<p>
Visitors can take a boat ride to El Arco, the arch where the Sea of CortŽs and the Pacific waters merge in a swirling spectacle. Sea lions live happily on the surrounding rocks. The Playa del Amor (Lover's Beach), next to the arch, is one of the best here. The Cabo Falso is an old lighthouse that stands on the huge friars, giant rock formations at the very tip of the peninsula, where the land and water meet.
<p>
The hotels and resorts in Los Cabos are some of the best in Baja. Several, like the five-star hotels, Finisterra and Twin Dolphin, and the Gran Turismo Hotel Cabo San Lucas, have been there since the days when Hollywood celebrities would come down for fishing expeditions along the rugged coast.
<p>
Today's visitors have even more deluxe properties to choose from, including the new Gran Turismo Westin Regina Resort and the Melia Cabo Real, both along the corridor. An alternative to the traditional resort is the all-inclusive Intercontinental Presidente Resort in San Jose del Cabo. Along the same boulevard are several modestly priced hotels, including the Aquamarina Suites, Fiesta Inn and Best Western Posada Real.
<p>
For those who wish to stay amid the excitement and entertainment of Cabo San Lucas, there is the Gran Turismo Hacienda Beach Resort, the five-star Melia San Lucas, and the four-star Plaza Las Glorias Hotel on the marina.

<center><font size=+2>MEXICO--A CLIMATE FOR ALL SEASONS</font></center>
<p>
Most people associate MŽxico with winter suntans and beautiful seaside resorts. They are not wrong, of course. While the Pacific and Caribbean coasts are just about the all-time favorite escape for those trapped by winter's blows, they are only part of the story. With an agreeable climate most of the year throughout its regions, MŽxico offers climatic variety that is unsurpassed elsewhere.
<p>
From the pastel-colored caves, striking desert landscapes and reddish-orange mountains of Baja California to the lush green jungles and turquoise waters of the Yucat‡n Peninsula, from the magnificent series of gorges of Copper Canyon to miles of sun-drenched white sandy beaches and clear azure waters of the Pacific Coast, the canvas that is Mexico is created from nature's rich palette of colors.
<p>
<b>GEOGRAPHY</b>
<p>
Spanning 2,000 miles from the western Pacific coast to the Gulf of MŽxico in the east, MŽxico's extremely diverse geography encompasses nearly every geological form found in the Western Hemisphere: low plains, rolling hills, rugged mountains and deserts to the north, 6,000 miles of seacoast, tropical lowland jungles, snowcapped mountains and awe-inspiring gorges.
<p>
The central highlands, which comprise 60 percent of the country's land mass, are bordered by the Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental mountain ranges, to the east and west, respectively, and by a row of towering, widely spaced volcanoes to the south.
<p>
MŽxico's terrain touches four distinct bodies of water, which accounts for the unmatched array of the country's sunny seaside destinations. The Sea of CortŽs (also called the Gulf of California) to the northwest, and the Caribbean to the southeast, host some of the world's richest marine life. The Gulf of MŽxico borders MŽxico's northeastern coast, and the Pacific Ocean meets the western shore. Nearly half the country is more than 5,000 feet above sea level.
<p>
<b>CLIMATE</b>
<p>
The country's nearly perfect climatic conditions are as welcoming and diverse as its colorful geography. There are two weather seasons: rainy and dry. Generally, rains fall and temperatures rise from June through October, leaving November through May as the more temperate, drier season. Annual average high temperatures range in the 80s and 90s; average lows between 40 and 60 degrees.
<p>
Most of the country lies south of the Tropic of Cancer, and the influence of the mountains, seas and ocean plays a great role in the varying conditions. For example, MŽxico's high mountains shield the Pacific beaches from the cold north winds that sweep south from Canada. 
<p>
Summer temperatures in most of MŽxico are comparable to summer temperatures in the midwestern United States, which makes May through August a great time to visit many parts of Mexico.  High-altitude cities within the Colonial Circle region of central Mexico maintain springlike temperatures year-round, making an inviting summer getaway for those who don't like the heat.
<p>
Much of the country is wonderfully dry and balmy, particularly the northern Baja California region. Southern MŽxico and the Yucat‡n Peninsula experience significant rainfall during the months of June, July, August and September, but the rest of the year this region is pleasantly dry and temperate. On the Pacific coast, from Puerto Vallarta south, the sun shines for at least part of every day, even during most of the rainy season. Each region has its own particular climate. the following is a brief sampling:
<p>
<b>BAJA CALIFORNIA</b>
<p>
Despite the desertlike landscape, Northern Baja California region resembles Southern California: mild winters with a little rain, and warm, dry summers. The Sea of CortŽs side of the peninsula tends to be warmer than the Pacific side. The annual average temperature is 68 degrees, and the average rainfall, less than 10 inches, occurs between December and April.
<p>
Southern Baja California is a subtropical desert that boasts more than 350 days of sunshine a year. Cool winter evenings, low humidity and refreshing sea breezes make even the highest summer temperatures (near 100 degrees F) comfortable and inviting. In the spring and fall, temperatures cool off to an ideal level, with the coolest temperatures on the Pacific side. The annual average temperature is 77 degrees F.
<p>
<b>WEST COAST</b>
<p>
The northwest coast is similar to Northern Baja, but with more rain and some storms. The annual average temperature is 68 degrees. Further south along the west coast is the Mexican Riviera, which has a year-round warm and tropical climate.  November through May are a sure bet for warm, dry days and balmy evenings. The rainy season is June through October, with daily rain showers and warm temperatures. The annual average temperature is 77 degrees F.
<p>
Mazatl‡n has a splendid, semi-arid, subtropical climate, with an average winter temperature of 70 to 80 degrees F.  Summers tend to be less humid here than in the more tropical destinations farther to the south, with an average summer temperature of between 85 and 95 degrees F. Seasonal storms are not too bothersome.
<p>
Puerto Vallarta, the treasure of the Mexican Riviera, is surrounded by a blanket of dense tropical jungle. This romantic destination shares its latitude with the Hawaiian Islands, and the sun seldom fails. The warmth of this vibrant resort--whose average temperature is 80 degrees F--is freshened by sea breezes.
<p>
Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo is settled in a semitropical area of direct ocean frontage, which assures a gentle climate throughout the year. The backdrop of the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains provides a spectacular vista. The resort itself is settled amid 16 miles of hilly coastline, laden with sandy beaches and scalloped coves. The sun shines almost every day, with an occasional drenching of rain in late summer. The average temperature is 78.8 degrees F, with brief showers during the rainy season between June and September.
<p>Acapulco Bay is a natural harbor, surrounded by mountains and cliffs, famous for the daring feats of Acapulco's cliff divers. Acapulco is a sun-worshipper's paradise and it is a rare day when the sun fails to shine. This popular resort is semitropical and sultry, with an average temperature in the 80s. 
<p>
Huatulco, designed around nine bays in a landscape of sun-baked boulders and jungle-covered hills in Oaxaca State, was born less than 10 years ago and is MexicoÕs newest developing resort area.  All its bays are noted for their golden sand and crystal waters.  Huatulco is climatically blessed, with little humidity and year-round temperatures averaging 82 degrees F and no rain from October through July.
<p>
<b>THE CENTRAL PLATEAU</b>
<p>
MŽxico's interior plateau offers an adventure in history, as well as topography. From Mexico City to Guadalajara, the higher elevations of the central plateau yield pleasant, springlike conditions through much of the year (evenings can be quite cool in the winter). This makes the destinations of the central region inviting in all seasons. The annual average temperature is a pleasant 65 degrees F.
<p>
MŽxico City, the world's largest metropolis, has an elevation of 7,349 feet. Its mild daytime weather is perfect for sightseeing and its cool evenings assure comfortable sleep.  Afternoon showers are not uncommon during the May-to-September rainy season. December and January are the coolest months, with an average annual high of 81 degrees F and a low of 41 degrees F.
<p>
Guadalajara has a delightful, balmy climate with an annual average temperature of 70 degrees F. Warm days and splendid nights are the norm, peppered with rain showers in the summer months.
<p>
The colonial circle of Mexico's Mesa Central highlands reaches an elevation of 6,000-7,000 feet. Guanajuato clings dramatically to a mountainous ravine, the gateway to the region's silver mines. The celebrated artists' community of San Miguel de Allende is situated on a hillside facing the Lara River. The colonial city of Oaxaca and its surrounding valley abound in natural and cultural history. It sits on an arid highland plateau some 5,000 feet above sea level. Morelia, the capital of Michoacan State, rests on a gentle slope overlooking the valley of Guayangareo.
<p>
Temperatures in Morelia and Guanajuato are generally in the 60s; the average monthly temperature in San Miguel de Allende ranges from 66 to 76 degrees F, with evenings slightly cooler than days. The rainy season is in late summer and early fall.      
<p>
<b>YUCAT‡N PENINSULA</b>
<p>
In the Yucat‡n Peninsula, proximity to the coast determines humidity and temperature, which averages 80 degrees F. Winters are traditionally the most popular time for a visit to this region, but the climate is mild year-round. In the summer, Gulf and Caribbean areas stay somewhat cooler due to trade winds, while interior jungles are hot and humid, with higher temperatures. Rainfall is frequent from April through May and September through January.  
<p>
Cancœn, which is actually a large island, was handpicked as a resort development because of its ideal climate and white, powder-soft sands. The heart of the Mexican Caribbean, Cancun is semitropical, with an average temperature of 80 degrees F. The sun shines about 240 days a year. The climate is refreshed by breezes, often brisk, that sweep across the low island. Cancun is generally out of the tropical storm route, with a rainy season in late fall and winter.
<p>
Cozumel, Mexico's largest island, has a climate similar to that of Cancun.  The island experiences some rain storms in late summer, and the infrequent tropical storm. Lying just 12 miles off the Yucat‡n Coast, it has beautiful weather just about any time of year. 
<p>
Akumal and other smaller resorts along the Cancun-Tulum corridor are located on the eastern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula.  Here, trade winds blow at a steady pace from morning to night, increasing slightly at dusk. The winds lower temperatures by at least 10 degrees, and most travelers don sweaters at nightfall.  Visitors come to dive or simply to walk on the long beaches filled with shells, crabs and migrant birds.
<p>
<b>THE GULF COAST</b>
<p>
The Gulf Coast is somewhat humid, with warmer temperatures. Rainfall increases significantly south of Tampico, with cooling, brisk, northerly winds from September through February. The annual average temperature is 72 degrees F.
<p>
<b>WEATHER INFORMATION</b>

<p>
<center><font size=+2>CANCUN AND THE CANCUN-TULUM CORRIDOR:
 WHERE FUN AND EDUCATION MEET</font></center>
<p>
The early Mayans believed Cancun was equal to a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. For some today, it has yielded riches beyond their wildest dreams. Beginning as a sleepy jungle village, it has developed over the last 25 years into Mexico's premier resort with more than  two million visitors annually, on a par with any along the famed French Riviera.
<p>
But the first to discover it were the ancient Maya over 2,000 years ago. They cavorted in its crystalline waters until about 1200 A.D. Today, it's a picture-perfect place where Mayan magic meets modern knowhow, where luxury hotels meet jungle wilderness, where sugary sand meets turquoise water, where fun meets education.
<p>
Cancun has become so popular in recent years that it surpassed Hawaii, Florida, and the French Riviera in having the highest hotel occupancy rates in the tourism industry. In fact, Cancun has overtaken Hawaii as the numero uno resort destination world-wide among vacation exchange (timeshare) networks. Today, occupancy rates hover at an average of 80 percent.
<p>
It is a shining example of state-of-the-art resort creation. From the outset, FONATUR, the government agency responsible for its development, had a master plan involving three major phases. Phase I, concentrated in town and on the strip of beach up to the Sheraton Cancun, came to a close at the end of 1985. Phase II concentrated on the area from the Sheraton to Club Med at Punta Nizuc. It's virtually complete, while Phase III focuses on residential area built according to demand. Under the master plan, Cancun was supposed to have moe than 20,000 rooms by 1990. It achieved that and more.
<p>
Not many places around the world can live up to the phrase "something for everyone,"  but Cancun, perched gracefully on the tip of Mexico's Yucatˆn Peninsula, can. More than just a resort town made up of powdery white beaches and cerulean waters, the area around Cancun truly offers visitors a rare opportunity to mix year-round summer fun and island hopping with educational, ecological adventure and Mayan culture.  
<p>
From the air, Cancun is shaped like a sandy number "7" jutting out from a blanket of dense, green jungle that is typical of the State of Quintana Roo. But closer inspection reveals that this 14-mile-long, ribbonlike peninsula is actually an island connected to the mainland by two bridges.  
<p>
<b>CANCUN CITY</b>
<p>
 As resort towns go, no other affords visitors so much to do in such a concentrated space. A city of 100,000 people and visited by almost two million a year, the "downtown" area is made up of four principal avenues: Tulum and Yaxchilan, which run north to south, and Uxmal and Coba, which run east to west.  Here, the streets are lined with fashionable shops, shopping malls, such as the Plaza Caracol, and restaurants that serve fare from all over the world.  
<p>
As the sun sets and the last sailboats get pulled up onto the shore, a metamorphosis takes place and Cancun switches into the high gear for which it is known. Nightlife begins, and after a sumptuous meal, people fan out across the area, following all sorts of musical rhythms--from reggae and rock & roll to Caribbean tunes and mellow, sexy jazz. People dance, listen or just kick back into the wee hours of the morning.   
<p>
<b>Accommodations</b>
<p>
Mexico's most famous beach swerves in a broad arc lined with a myriad of hotels. Built like pyramids or haciendas, the new breed of Cancun hotels, such as the Fiesta Americana Coral Beach, the Ritz Carlton, Melia Cancun and Melia Turquesa, and Cancun's newest, the Caesar Park Resort, give luxury a new meaning.
<p>
In the early years many of the hotels were centered at the junction near the convention center. Now 150 hotels, with more than 20,000 rooms, stretch almost to Club Med. 
<p>
Cancun's success is due, in part, to its ability to cater to every kind of taste. In this spirit, the town and resort offer accommodations in every category, and, depending on the hotel, might include complimentary amenities that you would have to pay for elsewhere.  
<p>
<b>Shopping</b>
<p>
Modern shopping centers and malls, similar to those in the U.S., are springing up everywhere. The marble arcades of the elegant Plaza Caracol Mall glitter with famous names like Bally and Gucci. Once the largest in the hotel zone, it now competes with at least a dozen others, including the magnificent Kukulkan Plaza Mall. Shop-til-you-drop visitors can start at Plaza Caracol, with hundreds of stores, leave by the north door and enter Costa Blanca shopping center before the air heats their skin. After Costa Blanca, they can move right into Terramar Plaza, then on to Plaza Lagunas, and on to Mayfair Plaza--all without taking a taxi.
<p>
In addition, handicraft markets downtown and across from the convention center attract souvenir hunters.
<p>
<b>Dining</b>
<p>
There are so many restaurants in Cancun that it's hard to know which ones to choose. When it comes to dining out in Cancun, visitors have their choice of more than 400 restaurants constituting a real United Nations taste experience. Just about every one of the world's most popular cuisines is represented here, including Italian, French, Japanese and Chinese, Mongolian, Swiss, and, of course, Mexican. Old stand-bys such as El Mortero in the Krystal Hotel and Lorenzillos are excellent, and new ones such as the Hard Rock Cafe and Iguana Wana are popular with the younger crowd. 
<p>
   In addition, hotel restaurants are no longer just places to catch a quick bite but are gourmet establishments in their own right. Bogart's in the Krystal Hotel is still packing them in but competition from Blue Bayou, a Cajun restaurant in the Hyatt Caribe, Scampi, with fine Italian cuisine in the Hyatt Regency, and La Joya, with fine Mexican cuisine and the longest wine list in Cancun in the Fiesta Americana Coral Beach, is strong.
<p>
The rowdy restaurant scene, where atmosphere is as important as the menu, formerly included such places as Carlos 'n' Charlie's and Panchos. Packing them in these days is Sen›r Frogs, a copy of a restaurant of the same name in Mazatlan. Jalapnos also maintains a foothold on the rowdy scene, as does the Cafe New York. Cancun even has its own Planet Hollywood!
<p>
<b>Nightlife</b>
<p>
When it comes to nightlife, Cancun rocks with the best. Discos like Daddy'O, Tequila Rock and Up and Down throb with the beat of the latest dance music as tanned bodies churn on the dance floor. Christine, the oldest, remains a Cancun classic, a confabulation of mirrored arches and lights. 
<p>
<b>Water Sports</b>
<p>
For those who love the water, Cancun has more than enough to satisfy even the most demanding. Snorkeling, deep-sea and shore fishing, scuba diving, kayaking, windsurfing, sailing (sunfish, hobie cat), water-skiing, jet-skiing and parasailing are all available in Cancun. While some of these activities might be offered through hotels, there are a number of marinas that also offer these services, such as the Marina Aqua Rey (INT-91-98-83-10-22, ext. 5531), from which you can get a peep into the deep on the "submarine" Sub Sea Explorer, and AquaTours (INT-91-98-83-04-00 or 83-02-27).
<p>
<b>Getting to Cancun</b>
<p>
These days, getting to Cancun could not be easier. Cancun International Airport lies just nine miles southwest of the heart of Cancun City and has planes landing from all over the world.  In fact, more international flights serve Cancun than any other Mexican destination. From the United States, Aeromexico, American, Continental, Mexicana, Northwest and United fly directly from a long roster of cities. American and Northwest offer direct flights to Cancun from major Canadian cities.
<p>
Once there, getting around Cancun is easy--cars, motor scooters, and bicycles for rent, or simply jump on one of the buses that traverse the Hotel Zone.
<p>
<b>EXCURSIONS</b>
<p>
Cancun makes a great base for exploring and offers more variety of activities than any other Mexican resort. Activities range from beachcombing to reef diving to exploring archeological sites. Options include visiting a crocodile farm or aquarium, strolling through a botanical garden or swimming in the crystal-clear waters of a natural cenote.
<p>
<b>Tulum</b>
<p>
The most popular excursion from Cancun is Tulum, the only Mayan city built on the coast. Tulum, the "City of the New Dawn,"  offers a sense of drama whenseen for the first time--its dark gray color in striking contrast with the crystal blue of the sea and sky. Tulum, built sometime in the 10th century but reaching its peak from the 12th to the 15th centuries, is believed to have been the only Mayan city still inhabited when the first Spanish conquistadores arrived.
<p>
The site, made up of 60 structures that are as varied in shape as they are in the emotions they evoke, is home to the Temple of the Descending God. The largest of Tulum's structures, the temple was so named because of the winged god carved over its entrance. In the Temple of the Frescoes, 13th-century wall paintings depict traditional Mayan deities.    
<p>
<b>Coba</b>
<p>
Another archeological site northwest of Tulum, Coba offers a real glimpse of the Mayan civilization's ancient grandeur. Exploring this city of pyramids and buildings along wide avenues set in the dense jungle is like going on a real-life Indiana Jones adventure. Climb the 365 steps of El Castillo to the Temple of the Plumed Serpent. You'll agree that the view is breathtaking, once you've got yours back, that is.
<p>
If either Tulumor Coba wets your appetite you can take an excursion to the most dramatic of all ruins, Chichen Itza, less than two hours southwest of Cancun by the new highway.
<p>
<bChichen Itza</b>
<p>
Many visitors prefer to take the full-day excursion to explore the ruins of Chichen Itza, sheltered in a jungle of wild papaya and sapodilla trees. This sacred Mayan city, features a complex of pyramids, observatories and shrines, topped off by the magnificent Pyramid of Kukulcan. Deluxe tours include continental breakfast, drinks, snacks and videos on board, as well as a stop for a late lunch. 
<p>
<b>Xian Ka'an</b>
<p>
As an introduction to ecotourism, you might wish to visit Xian Ka'an, the world's largest biosphere, also along the coast road. This 1.3 million-acre nature reserve contains tropical forest, wetlands, and marine habitats, including a section of the second longest barrier reef in the world. An eleven-hour tour is available from Cancun for $115 per person, including lunch and transportation from the resort. Tours, in open boats through Mayan canals, are conducted by Amigos de Xian Ka'an, a private non-profit organization which promotes the conservation of the reserve. For reservations, call or FAX ProNatura at 99/44-22-90 in Merida, or call Amigos de Xian Ka'an in Cancun at 84-95-83. The trip is fascinating and worth every dollar.
<p>
<b>CONVENTION CENTER OPENS</b>
<p>
With the opening of the Cancun Convention Center, Cancun is attracting a different sort of visitor these days, and is helping make Mexico a major player in the business travel market.  Located on the seafront of Punta Cancun on the outskirts of town, the center is just 20 minutes from the international airport, and within walking distance of some 3,000 hotel rooms.
<p>
Able to meet meeting planners' needs with a wide range of amenities, the center is fully equipped for state-of-the-art audio/visual presentations and has a full range of communications capabilities. The multiple meeting spaces within the sprawling center can be manipulated to fit almost any need--some spaces can hold up to 2,000 people. The lower two levels of the facility house 52 stores for shopping convenience. For more information, call INT-91-98-83-01-99 or 800/538-0424. 
<p>
In addition to the convention center, a number of city and beachfront hotels in Cancun offer full meeting facilities to complement those of the new center.
<p>
<b>CANCUN-TULUM CORRIDOR</b>
<p>
After "living it up" in Cancun, it's time to take advantage of the sights that distinguish this area from any other place in the world. Heading south on Highway 307 from Cancun, the 100-mile stretch of coast is known throughout the world as the "Cancun-Tulum Corridor." The road, which runs inland and parallel to the coast, winds through dense jungle occasionally marked by spectacular Mayan ruins and pocketed with quaint beachside villages. 
<p>
Just nine miles south of Cancun is an interesting stop that is worth a detour off the main road. At the Croco Cun, a massive breeding station, visitors can marvel at an assortment of more than 300 reptiles behind walled ponds. Here, visitors will discover how American crocodiles and Central American caimans are raised by taking-newly laid eggs and placing them in temperature-controlled rooms. The breeding grounds are open from 8 a.m.-6 p.m., and admission costs about $4/person.
<p>
<b>Puerto Morelos</b>
<p>
Further down 307 is Puerto Morelos, the first town along the coastal route. The lack of tourists and generally peaceful mood, combined with easy access to the sea, have made Puerto Morelos a very attractive getaway from the hustle and bustle of Cancun. Known ages ago as the departure point for Mayan women making pilgrimages to Cozumel, the streets of the town are lined with shops, a few restaurants and a cantina. Puerto Morelos also is home to one of the nicest diving reefs along the coast, filled with caverns of coral and multi-colored marine life.                        
<p>
Just south of the dock, where visitors pick up the ferry to Cozumel Island, is one of the newer hotel complexes sitting along an isolated stretch of white beach. The Caribbean Reef Resort is a three-story, white stucco building with 22 roomy villas (one bedroom and studios available), a pool, bar and beachfront restaurant that is said to serve some of the best Texas ribs in Mexico! Guests have free use of windsurfers, sunfish sailboats and tennis courts (rackets and balls available). For information, call 800/3-CANCUN.  
<p>
<b>Punta Bete</b>
<p>
A little further down the coast (about 20 miles) is Punta Bete, a four-mile stretch of beach with calm waters that makes a perfect place to stop for a swim. Swaying palms line the secluded shores, while 30 feet out the ocean floor turns to rock--making it ideal for snorkeling.  
<p>
In Punta Bete, Campout Kai Luum offers a perfect solution for "aspiring" campers who are just not willing to totally rough it.  Although there is no electricity, there are maids who will clean the modern beachfront tents daily, as guests relax on the hammocks strung up under their own palapa. Mornings are ushered in by sumptuous buffet breakfasts and Mayan chefs prepare different and creative meals under a huge palapa-covered beachside restaurant. For information, call 800/538-6802.
<p>
Another seaside resort worthy of a visit is the Caba–as Capitan Lafitte, complete with fine restaurant, swimming pool and game room. The charming stucco cabanas, equipped with ceiling fans, hot running water in private bathrooms, and double and king-sized beds, are cozy and comfortable. A skiff ride provided by the hotel will whisk guests to nearby Lafitte Reef, one of the most impressive snorkeling sites around. Rates include breakfast and dinner. For information, call 800/538-6802. 
<p>
<b>Playa del Carmen</b>
<p>
It used to be that visitors flocked to Playa del Carmen (about 30 miles from Cancun) only to make the ferry ride to Cozumel Island. But today, the town's open-air cafes, quaint shops, minimarkets, cantinas and oceanfront malecon (boardwalk) attract more than just passersby. Ferry rides to Cozumel depart about six times daily.
<p>
 Playa del Carmen offers a variety of accommodations--everything from camping grounds and beachside bungalows to hotels and all-inclusive resort villages. A recent building boom has created several beautiful places to stay just south of the busy ferry dock area. The Continental Playacar (800/882-6684), a five-story pink building complex with 188 rooms and 16 suites, has grounds that were carefully built around well-preserved Mayan ruins. Under the shade of the thatched mini-palapas, deck chairs line two crystal swimming pools and a nearby bar just off the beach. The air-conditioned rooms have terraces overlooking the sapphire-colored Caribbean waters.  
<p>
<b>Xcaret</b>
<p>
Four miles south and about one hour from Cancun along the paved road out of Playa del Carmen is Xcaret, a once-unassuming cove inlet turned tropical waterside theme park.  
<p>
Winding in and out of wild jungle surroundings, the park's main attraction is an underground river ride. The ride guides life-jacket and snorkel-wearing visitors through cool water currents that flow through mysterious caves and man-made caletas (inlets). If you've ever wanted to swim with dolphins, Xcaret, which means "Nature's Sacred Paradise," is the place to do it.  There's also horseback riding and a botanical garden.  
<p>
<b>Puerto Aventuras</b>
<p>
One of the newest and "upcoming" resort areas in the region is Puerto Aventuras. Located four miles south of Xcaret, the 900-acre self-contained resort has a 250-boat slip, private villas, the 9-hole resort golf course, a beach club, dive center and more than 500 luxurious hotel rooms. A popular stop is the CEDAM Underwater Archeology Museum that displays artifacts collected from a sunken Spanish merchant ship. 
<p>
<b>Akumal</b>
<p>
Just 22 miles south of Playa del Carmen, Akumal is one of the prettier beaches, and a favorite spot of divers. Once a large coconut plantation, the northern palm-lined area is known as Half Moon Bay, an exceptional snorkeling area lined with villas and condominiums. While some come here for the outstanding diving opportunities, others just stroll the tranquil beaches, combing for shells and catching sight of the ample bird life in the area.  There also is a small Mayan community here that offers their wares at informal markets in town.  
<p>
A family-oriented resort hotel located on the beach, the Club Akumal Caribe offers a wide variety of accommodations, ranging from two-bedroom suites (complete with two baths, living room and kitchen facilities) to two-bedroom condominiums and bungalows. Activities include diving, kayaking, windsurfing, snorkeling, fishing, tennis, jungle walks and a private pool.  Satellite TV is available and three restaurants are located on-site. For information, call 800/351-1622.
<p>
<b>Other Beaches in the Area</b>
<p>
There are several lesser-known beaches in the area that are worth a visit. Powder-soft sand and turquoise sea with swaying palm trees characterize Playa Chemuyil. A reef just offshore brings the waters to a quiet calm by the time they meet the shoreline, making for excellent swimming conditions. The beaches at Xcacel are no less spectacular. Laid-back visitors can ask to stay in any number of privately-owned seaside bungalows for a marginal fee.
<p>
<b>Xel-Ha</b>
<p>
The Quintana Roo coast offers many wonderful options for experienced and neophyte snorkelers alike. But one place that stands out is Xel-Ha, a natural aquarium considered to be one of the biggest in the world. Ten acres of stunning lagoons, coves and inlets naturally carved into the area's soft limestone terrain are home to countless species of tropical fish.
<p>
Located several miles south of Akumal, Xel-Ha offers visitors the opportunity to explore underwater caves, cenotes (sinkholes) and a partially submerged Mayan ruin. Snorkel gear and underwater cameras are available for rent. Or visitors can head deep into the jungle to the far side of the lagoon by glass-bottom boats. Xel-Ha also includes a shrine, small Mayan ruins throughout the park, a maritime museum and a seafood restaurant.  Open 8 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. Admission charged.  
<p>
<b>ISLAND HOPPING</b>
<p>
One of the most attractive features of Cancun and the Yucat‡n Peninsula is the variety of island day trips travelers can take. Each with its own distinct character, the islands have been able to preserve much of their Mayan culture with a profound concern for the environment, especially marine life.
<p>
<b>Isla Mujeres</b>
<p>
Shaped like a fish and about five miles across from the Bay of Cancun is Isla Mujeres, a place that offers a quiet respite from the fast-paced, round-the-clock lifestyle of Cancun. Only five miles long and 1,300 feet wide, the island was first called the "Island of Women" back in the days of Hernandez de Cordoba's arrival from Spain in 1518. When he landed, some say, he was greeted by only women (the men were said to have been fishing).  Another popular explanation claims that a large number of Mayan female clay figurines were found by the first Spanish conquistadores. 
<p>
Today, men and women flock here daily from Cancun to wade in the placid waters, listen to a little afternoon music on one of the many beaches, or snorkel in one of the several reef areas, such as the Manchones, Bandera and Tavos Reefs, all teeming with colorful parrotfish and angelfish. A good place for neophyte snorkelers is Garrafon National Park, located a couple of miles out of town. For more daring divers, there's a 68-foot dive into the renowned Cave of the Sleeping Sharks, said to often hold up to seven sharks at once.
<p>
The town, which is sandwiched between sand and sea, is located on the northern tip of the island and is the landing point for ferries arriving from Puerto Juarez, Punta Sam and Playa Linda. Shops selling everything from coral and silver jewelry to hammocks and Mayan figurines are abundant in town, as are diving shops.  
<p>
For those who wish to stay the night, the Caba–as Maria del Mar offers an interesting assortment of rooms. Decorated by local artisans, the rooms combine Spanish- and Mayan-style furnishings with colorful folk art. Beds are not mandatory either; some rooms are equipped with hammocks. Rates include a delicious continental breakfast. For information, call INT-91-98-77-02-13.
<p>
On the northernmost tip of the island is the newly-renovated, all-inclusive Costa Club, which has 94 rooms, 60 villas and six suites. The white beach in front of the hotel is dotted by palapas as is swimming pool and swim-up bar. Outdoor dining, a coffee shop and a number of activities organized by the staff make this one of the most well-equipped and charming hotels in the area. For information, call INT-91-98-77-01-22.   
<p>
<b>Isla Contoy</b>
<p>
Bird watchers and nature lovers should not miss this side trip to Isla Contoy, located about one hour from Isla Mujeres. A national wildlife preserve and bird sanctuary, Contoy Island is one of the reasons one-third of the world's known species of birds (1,018 total) can be found in Mexico. Flamingos, brown pelicans, cormorants, herons and magnificent frigate birds can best be seen at dawn and dusk, when they swoop down on empty stretches of beach. Tours leave daily from Isla Mujeres and cost about $35. 
<p>
<b>Cozumel</b>
<p>
Lying 12 miles east off the Yucatan Peninsula and a short 40-minute ferry ride from Playa del Carmen is Cozumel Island, considered by many to be one of the top five dive sites in the world. The island, which took its name from the Mayan language Ah-Cuzamil-Peten (the island of swallows), is generally flat with dense jungle filling the interior. Handsomely lined by white sandy beaches with rough surf on the eastward side, and calmer waters on the westward side, the 24-mile-long island is dotted by rocky strands and spectacular coral reefs along its perimeter.  
<p>
Because less than five percent of the island is developed, wildlife and marine life have flourished on and around Cozumel and is a principal draw for visitors year-round. During the month of July, people quietly watch as baby sea turtles, raised in the local hatchery, are released and slowly make their way down the sandy shores to swim freely in the Caribbean waters for the first time.  
<p>
For more information about turtle watching, call the Museum of the Island of Cozumel at INT-98-72-14-34/75.
<p>
Inland, the dense jungle shelters herons, iguanas, egrets, armadillos and a variety of birds. At Chankanab, an underwater preserve, swimmers can float in a mesmerizing marine landscape filled with schools of yellow and black sergeant majors darting in and out of black, red and white coral formations. 
<p>
In the town of San Miguel, where most of the 60,000 island residents live, the paved streets are lined with tourist shops, dive shops and restaurants, some of which serve traditional Mayan dishes such as pollo pibil and tikin-xik (chicken and fish dishes).  
<p>
The island offers a variety of accommodations, some right on the beach and some in town. One of Cozumel's most romantic and secluded hotels is the Presidente located on the end of the southern hotel zone. The hotel, which has its own beach, features 253 rooms (some pool/garden side, some sea/beach view), three bars, a pool, Jacuzzi, two lighted tennis courts and one of the finest restaurants (Arrecife) on the island. For information, call INT-91-98-72-02-22 or 800/447-6147.
<p>
For those interested in snorkeling and scuba diving, the Cozumel Reef hotel is perfectly located directly in front of one of the most spectacular dive sites. The hotel, with rooms with balconies overlooking the ocean, has three restaurants, three bars, two pools, a gym, two lighted tennis courts and a dive shop. For information, call INT-91-98-72-26-22.

<center><font size=+2>CHIAPAS: A WORLD UNTO ITSELF</font></center>
<p>
Compared to the rest of Mexico, Chiapas, the country's southernmost state, is a world unto itself. Its 200-mile Pacific coastline, tropical rain forests, cool highland lakes and rugged Sierra Madre mountains, appeal to the adventurous. Containing some of the most varied and dramatic geographical settings anywhere, it is, by far, Mexico's most diverse and complex state.
<p>
Chiapas is a land of contrasts, from the loud modern sounds of its capital, Tuxla Gutierrez, to the almost primitive lifestyle among the indigenas still living deep in the Lacandon Rain Forest.
<p>
Its formidable terrain kept it isolated from much of Mexico and the world until recently. Chiapas belonged to Guatemala until a treaty was signed making it a part of Mexico in the latter half of the 19th century.
<p>
Chiapas compresses within its 30,000 square miles a range of terrain, climate and natural wonders that entire countries might envy. Time, too, comes under Chiapas' spell: a day's journey can take the traveler from a modern capital to an exquisitely preserved Spanish colonial city, to ancient centers of civilizations thousands of years old, and to villages where the languages of those civilizations are still spoken. 
<p>
This is a land of Mayan ruins, some of which have yet to be discovered. Others, like Palenque, are visited by thousands each year. Students conduct tours from small villages to some of the hard-to-reach sites. Some of these can only be reached by plane or boat and then only in the driest season of the year. 	
<p>
<b>PALENQUE</b>
<p>
The magnificent ruins of Palenque lie half hidden in the jungle near the steamy hot village of the same name. Among the most highly developed by the Maya, they were, up until recently, only accessible by train or plane. Today, they can easily be reached by bus or car from Villahermosa in the neighboring state of Tabasco.
<p>
One of the most beautiful of Mayan sites anywhere, covering some 15 square miles, Palenque is a religious center from the Classic period. Discovered by the Spaniards in 1750, it was built for Lord Shield Pacal, a Mayan king, and reached maximum development between 600 and 700 A.D. Its graceful setting among emerald rain-forest hills, cliffs and streams, as well as its singular architecture, makes it world-famous. 
<p>
Palenque buildings feature sculptured friezes called roof combs; their stone and stucco walls are intricately carved with bas-relief representations of Palenque's rulers, as well as Mayan deities, monsters and symbols. 
<p>
Images of the Temple of the Inscriptions are familiar around the world from innumerable postcards, magazine spreads and even T-shirts. The 75-foot pyramid challenges visitors to climb the steep stone steps up to a view of the site and surrounding jungle that is breathtaking. 
<p>
Once on top, an narrow interior stairway leads down to one of the most exciting archaeological discoveries in the Americas: the tomb of Pacal. Until the discovery of the tomb in 1949 by archaeologist Alberto Ruz Lhuillier, it was believed that Mayan pyramids served only to elevate temples nearer to the heavens. The sarcophagus-containing tomb led to speculation that other Mayan pyramids may also contain the remains of ruling figures. The king buried here wore a gold and jade death mask and with him was buried a cache of pearl and jade jewelry, gold and other precious metals. The Temple's five-ton carved sarcophagus cover, as well as personal items belonging to the king and objects, apparently intended for the comfort of the deceased, have led some scholars to seek links between the Mayan religion and that of ancient Egypt.
<p>
Other Palenque buildings include the Palace, with its carved-stone tower; the Three Temples, adorned with religious symbols and believed to have been the center of priestly activity; and the Temple of the Jaguar plus smaller, but sometimes intricately decorated structures. An on-site museum displays sculptures of Mayan faces, elaborate carved stone slabs and other finds from recent excavation work. Maps suggest that there are several square miles around the site remaining to be excavated.
<p>
The nearby town of Palenque has grown along with the worldwide fascination surrounding the archaeological site. The town offers dozens of hotels and restaurants with a wide range of prices and amenities. The tourism agency will help with maps and information on tours to the Palenque site and other southern Chiapas attractions, as well as forays into Guatemala. 
<p>
<b>Outings from Palenque</b>
<p>
To describe all the Lacandon Maya villages, rain-forest trails, waterfalls, archaeological sites, mountain vistas, lakes and other beguiling attractions within reach of Palenque would require an entire guidebook. 
<p>
The most accessible sites, Bonampak and Yaxchilan, can only be reached by charter plane which can be hired from Palenque or by four-wheel drive vehicles via the rough gravel road, rain permitting.
<p>
<b>Bonampak</b>
<p>
More than 115 miles down the Usumacinta River, south of Palenque, lies the small Mayan ceremonial center of Bonampak, or the City of Painted Walls. Famous for its colored murals that depict everyday life around 600 A.D., including the conquering of a foreign city, Bonampak's paintings are generally considered the finest Mayan frescos yet discovered. Though the colors have faded, the images are strikingly like the Lacandon people that live in the area. 
<p>
<b>Yaxchilan</b>
<p>
The larger Mayan site of Yaxchilan, lies even deeper in the jungle than Bonampak, with which it is often combined on a single expedition. An important ceremonial center, Yaxchilan was built almost straight up a hillside within a thick growth of vines and mahogany trees along the twisting flow of the Usumacinta River about 20 miles north of Bonampak. During the Golden Age of the Maya, it became an art center as well as a political capital.
<p>
Its tall temples are carved with scenes of rulers, dieties, ball games and religious rites, as well as intricate hieroglyphs. Lord Jaguar Shield moved here and had sculptors carve intricate stelae in his honor. Next to a ball court on the side of the hill is a huge stela of a jaguar crouched and ready to leap next to a life-sized crocodile.
<p>
At Yaxchilan, visitors may climb so high that they can look out over the tallest trees. The view is spectacular, and the cries of scarlet macaws and the howling of jabbering of monkeys  fills the air.
<p>
Yaxchilan is accessible only by boat, making the tour an exceptional jungle adventure. Land/river tours of the sites, as well as of  the surrounding rainforest, can be arranged through Palenque travel agencies, which can provide the vehicles for a do-it-yourself trip or a fully guided tour. Either way, it's an undertaking designed for adventure seekers and Mayaphiles.

<center><font size=+2>MEXICO'S COPPER CANYON--ADVENTURE BY THE MILE</font></center>
<p>
The Copper Canyon, Mexico's most spectacular natural wonder, is even more accessible today. The Canyon, itself--actually, it is more like 20 canyons--offers visitors an outdoor experience so shockingly pure and majestic they feel as if they've entered an undiscovered civilization.
<p>
Situated in Chihuahua, one of Mexico's most Northwestern states, the Canyon cuts through a rugged section of northern Mexico's Sierra Madre mountains. Four times larger and 280 feet deeper than the Grand Canyon, Copper Canyon has resisted the taming of man. However, with new technology, more and more people are getting to experience its wonders. 
<p>
The expansive maze of lush canyons and tropical vegetation encompasses more than 900 square miles. Although this area is most commonly referred to as Copper Canyon, it is, in fact, a maze of more than 20 smaller canyons which combine to form a series of five interconnecting canyons or barrancas. The Copper Canyon is but one of these canyons. The others are Barranca de Sinforosa; Barranca Batopilas, Barranca Urique and Barranca de Guaynopa. 
<p>
These canyons link three main rivers through the length of the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains to Los Mochis and the Bay of California. Statistics show that the canyons are 1.5 times deeper and cover four times the area of Arizona's Grand Canyon in the United States. Maximum canyon depth is 12,140 feet from the top of Mohinora Peak to the canyon floor, and along the canyon rim, sheer stone walls drop vertically 6,000 feet to semi-tropical vegetation at the canyon's bottom.	
<p>
The Copper Canyon is not a solitary destination. Rather, it is a collection of sights and sounds, from the most tropical vegetation to the most incredible vistas in the world. 
<p>
<b>The Tarahumaras</b>
<p>
The Sierra Madre is home to the Tarahumaras, a population of approximately 50,000 native inhabitants. It is believed that these people came to settle in the canyon thousands of years ago from Asia. The word Tarahumara means foot runner, and these inhabitants prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt, they are as agile and full of endurance as the modern-day marathon runner.  In fact, the Tarahumaras have been known to run down wild deer and turkeys on foot.
<p>
As well, this unique group celebrates a traditional "three full day" game each fall which consists of kicking a wooden ball across the terrain.    
<p>
The majority of Tarahumaras live in a variety of places in the canyons, including in caves, alongside river banks and in small log cabins along the canyon floor. Far from heavy meat eaters, they succeed in maintaining a diet rich in calories and protein. A main staple of their diet is a liquid called pinole, a mixture of corn, flour, and water. On occasions, they also consume local beans, tortillas and different types of plants and roots. They are also known for their simple stews, which combine fried meats, onions and potatoes.   
<p>
A Tarahumara delicacy is a drink called tesguino, a fermented mixture of corn with a combination of leaves, roots and grass seeds added. Once mixed, this concoction is allowed to ferment twenty-four hours.  The result is a liquid rich in vitamins, minerals and calories.  
<p>
Visitors are encouraged to respect the customs and traditions of the Tarahumaras. This cultural sensitivity will be rewarded by a handshake, a smile and possibly an invitation into a private home. Most visitors to this region find an opportunity to interact with the Tarahumaras. Practically all operators offering tours to this region include a variety of walking and hiking tours to the dwellings of the Tarahumaras, and many visitors are welcomed into their caves for a cup of tesguino.
<p>
<b>The Copper Canyon by Train</b>
<p>
The Chihuahua al Pacifico railway, Copper Canyon's rail line, is a must for everyone. Inaugurated in November, 1961, this extraordinary ride takes passengers over 39 bridges and through more than 86 tunnels. It is, without doubt, a magnificent playground for the senses. The sheer excitement of traversing the Chinipas bridge, hundreds of feet above a watery gorge, is balanced by the slow rocking portion of the ride. These slower portions of the ride make it seem almost possible to lean over and pick the exotic berries and leaves which dangle from nearby trees.  
<p>
The history behind the train is as fascinating as the ride itself. In 1872, American-born  Albert Kinsey Owen had the idea to build a rail route between Topolobampo Bay and Kansas City, Kansas. At the time, one of the only available routes to Kansas City was from San Francisco, and the construction of a new route from Mexico to Kansas would cut the trip to Kansas by more than 400 miles. To date, Owen's dream has been realized as far south as Chihuahua. This engineering masterpiece includes sections of railroad that literally twist and weave around, creating circles of tracks along the way.  
<p>
Quaint hotels along the rim of the canyon and small towns off the beaten track with no more than 3,000 inhabitants each, provide just enough amenities to make this the trip of a lifetime. Well-worn jeans, a pair of cowboy boots, and a warm jacket for the crisp nights cover the casual protocol of the canyon.
<p>
Trains depart at the same time from both Los Mochis in the south and Chihuahua in the north. However, the city of Los Mochis remains on Mountain Standard time while Chihuahua is considered Central Standard Time. Trains from Los Mochis depart daily at 6 a.m. M.S.T. and Chihuahua at 7 a.m. C.S.T.  
<p>
In Chihuahua, travelers heading for Copper Canyon depart from the Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacifico station, located at Avenida Mendez and Avenida 24 A. Tickets may be purchased through most travel agents or at the station itself. A one-way ticket from Chihuahua to Los Mochis is approximately $33 U.S. and includes a box lunch. As well, there is often a dining car attached which provides simple sandwiches, soft drinks and coffee for a reasonable price. While it is best to pass them up, travelers are also tempted along the way by homemade tamales, tacos and empanadas sold by vendors at each of the stops along the route.  For more information on train travel from Chihuahua,  call INT-91-68-14-15-77-56 or 68-15-77-75 in Los Mochis.
<p>
Travelers wishing to depart from Los Mochis, the most western point on the rail line, may purchase their tickets at the train station, located two kilometers from the downtown district on the southeastern outskirts of the city.  
<p>
The city of Los Mochis, meaning "place of turtles," is located on Topolobampo bay, the third largest bay in the world.  Built during construction of the railway, it is a quiet town known for its crops of sugar cane, alfalfa, cotton, rice and  winter-grown vegetables. 
<p>
El Fuerte is a tiny, beautiful town just 52 miles from Los Mochis. Those wishing to board the train into the canyon may do so from El Fuerte. Cobblestone streets and picturesque squares help make this colonial town a wonderful starting point for canyon-goers.
<p>
One of the most enjoyable ways to experience the Barrancas is to stop at Divisadero, the halfway point between Los Mochis and Chihuahua. Here, the pure, crisp air, combined with the inspiring view that extends more than 100 miles across the Copper Canyon, makes for a fantasy come true.  
<p>
Divisadero, Copper Canyon's highest reachable point, rises  more than 7,700 feet above the canyon floor, affording spectacular views of the Urique River and the Urique and Copper canyons from this natural overlook.  
<p>
Visitors traveling from Los Mochis can expect to arrive at Divisadero at approximately 2 p.m. Upon disembarking from the train, travelers are catapulted into the colorful hubbub of Divisadero's open-air market. Shoppers will delight at the abundance of hand-made baskets, wooden dolls, jewelry and even violins sold here. The vendors, including the local residents and the native Tarahumaras, swoop down in one great mass to set up their stands for approximately 45 minutes each day before the scheduled train stops. regateando, or bartering, is highly encouraged at the market.
<p>
<b>New Luxury Rail Services</b>
<p>
For those travelers drawn to elegance and opulence, the Chihuahua al Pacifico Railway is now home to the most luxurious rail tours in the continent. DRC Rail Tours, based in Houston, Texas, has just launched private rail excursions into the Canyon.  The South Orient Express, as it is called, runs seasonally from October to November and March to April and features lavish turn-of-the-century-style passenger cars, all glass vista domes, elegant bars and world-class gourmet cuisine.
<p>
An alternative to taking the South Orient Express is DRC's new first class train operating daily in both directions--Chihuahua-Los Mochis and vice versa. 
<p>
Still another option for luxury train travel is The Sierra Madre Express offered by Tauck Tours. Combining five pullman cars, observation lounges and deluxe staterooms, tour participants spend two of seven nights of an all-inclusive eight-day package aboard the train. For more information, call DRC Rail Tours 800/659-7602 or Tauck Tours 800/468-2825.  
<p>
<b>The Copper Canyon by Car</b>
<p>
One scenic way to reach Copper Canyon is by car. From Chihuahua, travelers may travel as far as six hours south to Creel and should be prepared to experience a dozen new adventures along the way. 
<p>
From Chihuahua, drivers may head southwest on Highway 16.  The roads are now paved all the way to Creel. En route, visitors travel through scenic ranching and agricultural areas and mountains dotted with log cabins, railroad car homes, logging camps and old mines.   
<p>
 This journey takes visitors through the Mennonite community of Cuauhtemoc and across the 94-mile stretch of wooded waterways, beautiful orchards and winding mountain roads.
<p>
 Travelers will rejoice in the hospitality of the Mennonite settlement. The Mennonites came to Cuauhtemoc from the United States in the 1920's. They eventually migrated to Mexico after centuries of living in such places as Prussia, Germany and Canada. Upon approval from President Alvaro Obregon, Mexico's president at the time, the settlers were granted permission to remain in Mexico for a period of 50 years. They were also given special permission that allowed them not to pay taxes, nor were they obligated to send their children to the local schools.
<p>
Instead, the Mennonites built their own schools and trained their own teachers. Since the main occupation of this group is  farming, children complete their education by the 6th grade. The Mennonites produce many items locally, including cheeses and handmade fabrics.  
<p>
The population of Mennonites has remained at approximately 50,000, and travelers, whether on their own or with a group, are encouraged to share a few words and to break bread with these kind people. Indeed, several tour operators such as Anderson Travel Tours and Chihuahua al Pacifico Tours offer tour packages through the region, which include a stop in Cuauhtemoc for a family-style lunch at a private Mennonite home in the community.
<p>
From Cuauhtemoc, road travelers can continue their adventure to the quiet lumber town of Creel, where many choose to continue their explorations of the canyons on foot or catch the south-bound Chihuahua al Pacifico train.  
<p>
<b>Accommodations in the Copper Canyon</b>
<p>
For travelers wishing to stay overnight in Creel, there are a handful of rustic places to choose from. The Parador de la Montana Motel offers 50 rooms, a restaurant, bar, gift shop, TV and phones. For information, call INT-91-68-14-10-45-80. For the more adventurous, the Copper Canyon Lodge, located about 15 miles from the train station in Creel, offers hearty meals and is close to Cusarare Falls. The area provides a very romantic setting as electricity hasn't yet made its way to the Lodge, and kerosene lamps are the norm. For information, call INT 91-68-14-56-01-79.  
<p>
Some of Copper Canyon's most unique and cozy hotels can be found at Divisadero. For those wishing to get away from it all, Divisadero's the place to be. While travelers won't find many telephones on the mountain, there is no lack of warmth, hospitality and great food. Hotels in the area include the Cabanas Divisadero Barrancas, a 55-room, picturesque lodge with stone construction, fireplaces in the rooms, dining room and bar. 
<p>
This is the oldest and only hotel in the Canyon that was built on the actual rim of the canyon. Regional meals such as carne machacada (sun-dried beef) and soups of Chihuahua-grown beans, are served family-style in large dining rooms that provide panoramic views of the landscape. With three meals included, rooms average approximately $150/night. Personal guides, walking and hiking tours and horseback riding are available. For information, call INT-91-68-14-15-11-99 or 14-10-33-30 in Chihuahua.   
<p>
The Posada Barrancas, set in an apple orchard, has just added a new annex, named the Posada Barrancas Mirador. There are 32 new rooms, each decorated in light wood with modern fixtures.  The rooms offer a breathtaking view of the canyon. You will also find a dining room, bar and Tarahumara dancers. The hotel also offers hiking and horseback tours, and additional information may be found by calling The Santa Anita Hotel in Los Mochis at INT-91-68-12-00-46.  
<p>
El Mansion Tarahumara (Tarahumara Mansion) looks like a medieval castle. Delicately balanced atop a hill, this unique hotel offers individual cottages, complete with fireplaces, large rustic rooms and delicious family-style meals. For information, call INT-91-68-14-15-47-21 or 14-10-24-93 in Chihuahua.
<p>
<b>Excursions in the Barrancas</b>
<p>
Tucked away within the canyons of northern Mexico are some of the most exquisitely romantic and isolated places ever discovered. The canyons offer a multitude of hiking, rail, walking and horseback riding tours, all guaranteed to delight adventure-seekers.  
  <p>
More than any other region in Mexico, the canyons provide  spectacular hiking tours. Several operators offer three-to-six day hiking tours, depending on the type of tour desired.  Typically, they cost from $300 to $700. Most meals, guides, lodging accommodations, and transfers to the point of origin of the tours are included. As with most excursions, the variety and level of challenge varies tremendously.  
<p>
For the devoted hiker, a select number of tours lead travelers into the most remote areas of the canyon, where the next three days are spent exploring, eating, swimming and sleeping miles away from civilization. There are also hiking tours which use the "hub and spoke" theory. That is, hikers leave on day excursions to different areas before returning each evening to the same lodge.   
<p>
<b>BasasŽachic Falls National Park</b>
<p>
BasasŽachic Falls National Park is the only nationally designated park in the Northern Sierras. BasasŽachic Falls, cascading 900 feet to the canyon floor, is Mexico's highest waterfall, the fourth largest waterfall in North America and the 20th highest waterfall in the world.  
<p>
The hike to the falls is world-famous. Travelers begin in the village of Basaseachi and follow a trail which takes its followers across beautiful streams, up steep slopes, and then down nearly 1,000 feet below to the base of the falls.
<p>
<b>Batopilas</b>
<p>
A day trip with local town operators to Batopilas Canyon from Creel takes visitors through the mining towns of La Bufa and Batopilas at the bottom of the canyon. Batopilas thrived between 1880 and 1910 and was the second town in Mexico to receive electricity after Mexico City. Ruins of the Hacienda de San Miguel provide evidence of the grandeur and mystery of this colonial mining village hidden in one of North America's deepest canyons.
<p>
In Batopilas, the Riverside Lodge, a restored hacienda from the late 19th century, makes for an unforgettable stay.  Travelers will find themselves lighting kerosene lamps while plugging in their hair dryers as the lodge offers partial electricity only. The atmosphere is undeniably relaxed. Guests are told to eat and drink as they like, and bills are paid at the end of their stay. For information, call Copper Canyon Lodges, 313/689-2444 or 800/77-MEXICO. 
<p>
Four miles beyond Batopilas at Satevo is the Lost Cathedral, a solid red brick church built in 1750, whose padres ministered to the groups of indigenous people and settlers working in the mining communities through 1910. Travelers should dress appropriately as the canyon floor tends to be hot.  
<p>
The history behind the construction and name of the church is, at best, vague. Many believe the church was built for the indigenous people who worked in the nearby silver and gold mines.  The church's unusual construction features three domes and four half domes connected by a vaulted ceiling arching three stories above the empty chamber. Flagstones cover the resting places of several padres.  
<p>
<b>Bahuichivo/Cerocahui</b>
<p>
Bahuichivo is the stopping-off point for Cerocahui, a valley filled with orchards. Travelers can lodge at the Hotel Mision de Cerocahui, a 15-mile drive from the station. For information, call the Santa Anita Hotel in Los Mochis at INT-91-68-15-70-46.  
<p>
From Cerocahui, it is an easy day trip to Urique Canyon and a Tarahumara cave settlement on a dirt road 8,500 feet above Cerocahui. Rising 5,000 feet above the Urique River, Cerocahui was founded in 1680 by an Italian Jesuit. One of the most beautiful mountain towns in Mexico, Cerocahui still has an operating Jesuit Mission Church.

<center><font size=+2>ACAPULCO--STILL QUEEN OF THE MEXICAN RIVIERA</font></center>
<p>
Acapulco is synonymous with extravagance.  Acapulco, the oldest of Mexico's beach resorts, still reigns as queen. Ever since the early days of beach parties hosted by the Hollywood's Johnny Weismuller, famed Olympian who brought Tarzan to the silver screen, the resort has catered to the jet set.  She is beautiful--a broad blue bay is surrounded by sleek high-rise hotels against the backdrop of emerald hills.  She is glamorous--high fashion goes hand-in-hand with worldly sophistication.  She is upbeat--dozens of discos pound their beat until dawn.  It is no wonder that many of the world's rich and famous come here to relax and unwind.
<p>
The stunning sight of Acapulco's mountain--rimmed harbor, rivaled only by the sea views of Rio de Janeiro and Hong Kong, the brilliant masses of tropical flowers, the sultry climate and a sensuous aura are enough to seduce anyone.
<p>
Acapulco is not a place for "getting away from it all."  Over four million people visit the resort yearly.  It is not, in fact, a place to get away from much of anything except the rest of the world's rotten weather and that is the main reason most  people come here.  Warm balmy breezes blow the air that ranges from 79 to 85 degrees F (26-29C.) most of the year.
<p>
The spectacular beauty of Acapulco Bay has been appreciated for centuries.  In 1530, the Spaniards chose her as their mainport on the Pacific Coast for the exploration of the South Seas.  Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, a Basque sailor, set sail from Acapulco in 1564 for the Far East, and for the next 250 years, galleons sailed in and out of Acapulco, shipping more than 200 million pesos worth of silver to the Orient in exchange for spices, porcelain, silks and ivory.  From Acapulco, these riches went by mule train to Mexico City and then on to Veracruz for shipment to Spain.
<p>
However, riches draw pirates and Acapulco was forced to arm itself.  Fort San Diego was constructed in 1616 to defend the port city against pirate raids.  Destroyed in 1776 by an earthquake, it was rebuilt and is open to view today.
<p>
After  Mexico's War of Independence in 1810, trade with the Orient ceased.  Acapulco became a forgotten fishing village until a road was finally built from Mexico City in 1922; even then it took another ten years for it to get its start as a beach resort.  It really came into its own in the 1950's when it began to be known as "The Riviera of the West."
<p>
In tribute to the charms of Acapulco, the seductive sun goddess, palaces with gorgeous gardens and magnificent pools have been carved out of the hills.  In keeping with the sybaritic atmosphere, sun devotees display golden suntans, the briefest of daytime bathing suits and glamorous nighttime attire.
<p>
In her younger days, action was centered on Caleta and Los Hornos Beaches.  Today, the emphasis has shifted to La Condesa and Paraiso Beaches, both punctuated by high-rise hotels.  This super strip--now known as Golden Acapulco--along a seven-mile boulevard, Costera Miguel Alem‡n, offers everything for la duce vida.  It offers powdery sand and palapa-topped seaside restaurants, where sun worshippers can peel shrimp and sip fruit-garnished potions from coconut shells while listening to live music.
<p>
There is something for everyone here and plenty of things to do.  It seems as if Acapulco never sleeps.  Most shops and boutiques open at 10 a.m., when most jetsetters are sleeping off the night before. Hotels cater to late risers and many serve breakfast until noon.
<p>
After a morning on the beach, many people stroll the Costera, which has special sidewalks that absorb the heat and make barefoot walking bearable.  Up in the azure blue skies, others are dangling from brilliantly striped parachutes as they parasail over the harbor.  Bronzed water skiers zip over the undulating waves, as beach vendors, walking boutiques of resort fashions--jewelry, hammocks, pottery, and blankets--offer irresistible bargains.
<p>
At night, the sounds of tropical, guitar, and rock music drift through the air, mingling with the sounds of the ocean and the murmur of gentle conversations.  This is the best time to take a ride in a balloon-festooned calendria, or horse and carriage.  Dining, dancing, spectacular shows, all offer romantic escapes.  Some of the best discos in the world--UBQ, Extravaganza, Fantasy, BabyO, Boccacio--vying for attention from the see-and-want-to-be-seen crowd, can be found here.
<p>
Mexican Fiesta Nights, held at most of the major hotels and the Acapulco Centro's Plaza Mexican, add real Mexican flavor to a Riviera-like vacation.  There is also a Mexican Folkloric Ballet held in the Netzahuacoyotl Theater and performing arts events are often held in the Juan Ruiz Alarcon Theater in the same complex.
<p>
Not to be missed are the cliff divers of La Quebrada.  Holding flaming torches, they plunge from a 150-foot cliff into a shallow inlet.  Performing four shows beginning at 9:15 p.m.. They can be seen from the Plaza Las Glorias El Mirador Hotel's La Perla nightclub.
<p>
Before that, many people head out to Pie de la Cuesta to take in hora de la puesta del sol (sunset hour)--a riot of deep orange, yellow and vermilion, changing slowly to black velvet.  West of the city proper, this romantic hideaway, once the exclusive turf of Acapulco regulars, is the best place to watch the sunset while cuddled up in a hammock and sipping a coco loco.  Just beyond is Laguna de Coyuca, a primitive freshwater lagoon and bird sanctuary bordered  by coconut palms.  Coyuca abounds in mullet, catfish, and snook and small fishing boats are available for rent.
<p>
<b>ACAPULCO DIAMANTE</b>
<p>
Acapulco's newest addition, Acapulco Diamante, the mega-resort in the planning stages for many years, stretches from Puerto Marques Bay to the airport along Revolcadero Beach.
<p>
Planned from its beginning in 1990, this new aspect of Acapulco offers 7,000 rooms built into new low-rise resort hotels over 10,000 acres with a total investment of over $1 billion.  The first fully planned development in the city's history, with zoning planning the key consideration, it will offer a modern infrastructure completely integrated with surrounding environment in an area bigger than all of Acapulco Bay.
<p>
Developers have also planned for ecological reserves side by side with a modern road system and unique architecture.  Included is Punta Diamante, or Diamond Point, and the vast dune expanse of  Paya Diamante, or Diamond Beach.  A highlight will be ecological restoration of the Laguna Negro, or the Black Lagoon, near the airport.
<p>
Another impetus for the project came with the completion of the new four-lane highway to Mexico City--the Autopista del Sol--which terminates at Acapulco Diamante and brings the capital within a four-hour drive of the sea.
<p>
At the heart of Acapulco Diamante are the 20-year-old Acapulco Princess and Pierre Marques Hotels, with their accompanying golf courses, tennis courts, and swimming pools along Revolcadero Beach.  A new boulevard connects the newer structures, constructed completely of Mexican materials, within this estate-like complex.
<p>
Three new resorts--the 220-room Acapulco Sheraton, the 400-room Mayan Palace Vidafel Hotel and the 160-room Camino Real Acapulco Diamante--offer all the latest amenities.
<p>
Located on a small parcel of land surrounded by private homes, the Sheraton Acapulco Resort clings to a steep cliff above Puerto Marques Bay.  From the hotel's small sandy Guitarron Beach, guests can look across the Bay toward Golden Acapulco or off to the left toward traditional Acapulco.  The complex of 14 separate buildings ranges from cliffside villas to an oceanfront palapa restaurant and nearby pools.  Each building, containing ample rooms with small balconies, has a flower's name--Rosa, Margarita, Jazmin, Begona, Bougainvillea, etc.--and all were constructed with connecting cobblestone walkways and stone steps, making it difficult for elderly or disabled persons. However, the hotel now has a tramway connecting its upper and lower levels, making ascending and descending the rocky hillside a breeze.
<p>
The Mayan Palace Vidafel Hotel, a fantasyland for the whole family, is built at the other end of Revolcadero Beach towards the airport.  Its 400 rooms are surrounded  by enormous mirror-like pools and waterfalls, connected by Venice-like canals, with flower-laden boats to float you around the entire area.  Copies of huge impressive centuries-old Mayan carvings are framed by spectacular arched doorways that let the breezes cool you wherever you go.  Across the road from the resort, and connected to it by an elevated monorail, is an 18-hole golf course and 12 tennis courts.
<p>
The Camino Real Acapulco Diamante Hotel, located on the secluded slope of a hill to one side of the mouth of picturesque Puerto Marques Bay, boasts a balcony or terrace with a fantastic view from every room.  The hotel's contemporary styling and high-tech amenities make it not only the newest but also the most technologically advanced in Acapulco.
<p>
Entrance to another hotel zone within the Acapulco Diamante development, the Real Diamante area, is marked by a monumental sculpture, "Pueblo de Sol,"or "Humanity Under the Sun," created by the famous international artist, Pal Kepenyes, a native of Acapulco.  At the end of the new road, called the Boulevard de las Palmas, is the Quinta Real Hotel.
<p>
The centerpiece of the whole project is the Acapulco Diamante Country Club, with 400 residences built around an 18-hole luxury golf course, with 200 slips for yachts in a new marina located next to the project on Tres Palos Lagoon.  A $5 million club house will house facilities for golf and tennis players, a marina club and a 150-room hotel.

<p>
<center><font size=+2>FONATUR: THE FINANCIAL FORCE FOR
TOURISM GROWTH IN MEXICO</font></center>
<p>
The government of Mexico has long recognized the increasing importance of tourism to the nation's economy. More than 30 years ago a national plan--The National Trust Fund for Tourism Development or FONATUR--was drafted for the responsible development of the country's unique tourism assets.
<p>
FONATUR is the result of the merger of two government agencies, the National Fund for Tourist Infrastructure (Infratur), charged with developing infrastructure for tourism sites, and the Tourism Guarantee Fund (Fogatur), charged with financing hotel and integrated tourist developments.  It is currently the institution in charge of coordinating and promoting the expansion and improvement of Mexico's tourism infrastructure. It also oversees the development of Mexico's five internationally-known, integrally-planned tourism centers of Cancun, Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo, the Bays of Huatulco, Los Cabos and Loreto. 
<p>
The agency, which began planning and developing these resorts in the mid-1970s, has become a model for other countries with fledgling tourism industries.
<p>
Terrain, market factors, and the feasibility of developing infrastructure such as sewage, electrical power and communications systems were all studied rigorously before development of the resorts began. Now that they have been established, their support, control, and development is being maintained. FONATUR also is committed to preserving the ecological viability of the locations it develops.
<p>
Working with tourism investors, operators, and entrepreneurs, FONATUR today encompasses three major programs:   development and consolidation of existing resorts; financing of tourism projects, including that for construction, amplification and remodeling in any region of the country; and encouragement of direct investment. The newest and most important aspect of FONATUR's program is the development of integrated project sites.
<p>
Development and consolidation of existing resorts includes infrastructure and real estate development. FONATUR carries out the development of the projects' facilities and then sells and/or leases the land and buildings. The agency is also responsible for property management, operation and maintenance.
<p>
FONATUR's financing activities include the provision of all types of capital for the construction, expansion and remodeling of hotels and other tourism facilities throughout Mexico. Between 1974, the year it was created, and 1993, FONATUR granted some $1.3 billion in financing for tourism projects.
<p>
The agency's integrated project program, also known as its "megaproject" program, involves an overall strategy for the development of selected tourism destinations with FONATUR's financial and promotional support. The plan designates uses for land, keeping in mind the area's natural resources and other ecological concerns. After formulating the plan, FONATUR then markets and sells the underlying real estate to domestic and foreign investors. "Megaprojects" are now either completed or underway in all of FONATUR's resorts.
<p>
When the current 14 megaprojects have been completely developed, they will have attracted some $8 billion in investment, created over 300,000 jobs, received over four million visitors a year, and generated some $3 billion annually in foreign exchange. FONATUR recoups its investments through the sale of land parcels or its equity share in specific tourism projects.
<p>
Mexico's "open arms" policy to foreign investors has led to a renewed and explosive growth in the tourism industry.  Liberalized foreign investment regulations are responsible for much of the growth in development. The government's successful privatization efforts have also contributed to higher levels of investment. Not surprisingly, 20 percent of all recent foreign investment has been channeled into the tourism sector.
<p>
The Mexican government now allows 100 percent foreign ownership in a wide range of industry sectors, and foreign entities now can invest in Mexico's coastal and border areas, once restricted from any kind of foreign investment, through a real estate investment trust. The mechanism permits foreign investors to obtain the economic benefits that accompany equity ownership in some of Mexico's most attractive tourism industry properties.
<p>
The following is a list of the latest developments in each of FONATUR's five integrally-planned tourism centers:
<p>
<b>Cancun</b>
<p>
The completed infrastructure at Cancun now makes it the most important and largest tourism destination in the country.  Inaugurated in 1974, it has grown to nearly 20,000 rooms, distributed in hotels ranging from inexpensive to the "grand tourism" category. 
<p>
Cancun alone welcomes close to two million visitors annually, generating over $1.3 million in foreign currency income.  More than 75 percent of all visitors to Cancun are foreigners, and Cancun is a leading competitor of the world's Caribbean destinations. Cancun also receives more flights from the United States, Europe and Canada than any other Mexican tourism destination.
<p>
Megaprojects in Cancun include: "Puerto Cancun," a nautical tourist development, with two 18-hole golf courses, a polo field and more than 4,000 hotel rooms; "Malecon Cancun", a tourism and urban center, and "Ruinas del Rey," home to the new 400-room Ceasar-park Hotel, an 18-hole golf course and a real estate subdivision.  The Mexican investment groups, D.S.C. Turismo and Constructora La Nacional, in conjunction with FONATUR, apportioned $49 million in order to initiate the projects in 1991.
<p>
<b>Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo</b>
<p>
Since 1975, hotel accommodations in Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo have increased ten-fold, so that today it has more than 4,000 rooms, grouped into 14 hotels of the grand tourism category.
<p>
Zihuatanejo, which offers more moderate accommodations--with the exception of three exclusive, top-quality small hotels--has more than 700 rooms.
<p>
"Marina Ixtapa," a new marina, golf course, hotel and apartment development, "Punta Ixtapa," a residential and hotel development, and "Azul Ixtapa," a luxury condominium project, all have added to the amenities offered to visitors.
<p>
<b>Los Cabos</b>
<p>
In recognition of the fact that the twin resorts of San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas are international sport fishing meccas, FONATUR constructed a marina with 320 slips around hotels and residential condominiums. Los Cabos has more than 3,000 rooms distributed in 36 hotels.
<p>
However, this is just the beginning of explosive growth that is taking place here, especially in Cabo San Lucas.  Many foreign investors are taking advantage of opportunities for new business.  While FONATUR is not seeking investment in any megaprojects in Los Cabos at this time, there are some large- and small-scale private sector projects. 
<p>
<b>Loreto</b>
<p>
Loreto is FONATUR's smallest integrally-planned tourism center, with 15,000 inhabitants and five hotels, targeted mainly at sport fishing aficionados. To the south of Loreto is Punta Nopolo, a tourism development which already has a four-star hotel, a beach club, an 18-hole golf course, and tennis center with a stadium and eight courts. 
<p>
This area now has seven hotels and construction of two additional hotels is planned for FONATUR's megaproject site, Puerto Loreto. These hotels will add 500 hotels to Loreto's capacity.
<p>
Future growth in Loreto is expected with the completion of a new FONATUR "Puerto Loreto" megaproject, a nautical, residential and hotel development located 25 kilometers south of Loreto. By the year 2000, the port is expected to attract nearly 8,000 sporting boats. Three grand turismo hotels are currently under construction, with a total of 750 rooms.
<p>
<b>The Bays of Huatulco</b>
<p>
The Bays of Huatulco is considered one of the most ambitious long-term tourism projects undertaken by the Mexican government.  With more than two-thirds of the development to be kept as an ecological preservation, it may well become the prototype for future tourism projects. 
<p>
Currently, the Bays of Huatulco has 15 hotels with more than 1,700 rooms. Planned megaprojects include "Puerto Chahue," a marina with nautical and residential areas, and "Bahia de Cacaluta," a complete resort with a marina and a golf course.

BACKGROUNDER
<p>
<center><font size=+2>EXPLORING MEXICO'S MAYAN WORLD</font></center>
<p>
With more cities than ancient Egypt, the Mayas created a unique civilization in a harsh landscape that ranges from sauna-hot jungles and swamps to the sun-baked limestone of the Yucat‡n Peninsula. They invented America's most sophisticated written language and were excellent mathematicians and astronomers, arriving at the concept of zero before the Europeans and developing a calendar more accurate than the one we use today.
<p>
Their temples and ceremonial cities--many adorned with fine relief carvings and sculpture, intricate stone mosaics, and gaping masks of Mayan gods--rank among the great artistic and architectural treasures of the world.
<p>
Two thousand years ago on the Yucat‡n Peninsula, millions of Mayan worshippers paid tribute to Kinich, the deity whose face was the sun. Today, millions of vacationers at Cancœn and other Yucat‡n super-resorts perform their own rituals in praise of that same bright countenance. The Yucat‡n Peninsula, Mexico's southernmost tip, is a vast region blessed with abundant sun, and renowned the world over for its ancient Mayan temples and cities which rise from teeming jungles. The area's natural heritage continues to thrive in huge biosphere reserves comprising rain forest, coral reef and lagoon habitats.
<p>
The states of Yucat‡n, Quintana Roo and Campeche are generally thought of as "the Yucat‡n," though the peninsula also includes the western states of Chiapas and Tabasco. The area was one of the last to fall to the Spanish conquistadors and among the last to join the Mexican nation. Major highways and other infrastructure development arrived here as little as 30 years ago, yet the Caribbean coast today boasts some of the Mexico's most traveled beach resorts such as Cancœn, Isla Mujures, Cozumel and Playa del Carmen, where contemporary high-rise hotels stand next to thousand-year-old remnants of vanished civilizations.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>The Mayan World</b></font>
<p>
The Yucat‡n Peninsula, along with neighboring countries to the south, saw the beginnings of the highly developed Mayan civilization as early as 800 B.C.  Scattered settlements coalesced into centralized cities that achieved great breakthroughs in science and invention: the Mayans developed a mathematical system that used the concept of zero and number places long before a similar system came to Europe.  The Mayan calendar, based on accurate astronomical observations, accurately measured the solar year and could project dates millions of years in the past or thousands of years in the future.
<p>
Cities and ceremonial centers reached phenomenal proportions in the Classic Period, about 200 B.C.-900 A.D. Urban centers flourished with planned geometric layouts, broad boulevards, functioning water and sewer systems, huge pyramids, as well as palaces and ball courts the size of soccer fields. 
<p>
Mayan brilliance in the sciences and in social organization were matched by their arts. Intricately crafted statues, wall carvings, paintings and abstract decorations set Mayan sites apart from those of any other world culture. Since the Maya never made use of the wheel (except in toys) nor of domestic animals, their achievements are all the more amazing.
<p>
Mayan culture reached its height around 900 A.D. and then declined rapidly. By the time the conquistadors arrived in the 16th century, the great Mayan cities had long been abandoned.  Though theories abound, the causes of the decline and fall remain one of many mysteries that characterize Mexico's ancient civilizations.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Visiting the Region</b></font>
<p>
Mundo Maya, the Mayan World, contains thousands of ancient Mayan sites in the Yucat‡n as well as in Guatemala, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador. These five nations developed a cooperative plan to open the region to travelers while preserving its unique cultural and natural heritage.
<p>
One of the great benefits of visiting the Mayan World is the convenience the region offers visitors, due to the proximity afforded by charming and colonial MŽrida, as well as the world-class resort of Cancœn. By using MŽrida or Cancœn as a base, visitors can easily explore the mysteries of the Mayan World while taking in some of the local sights and attractions these unique places offer.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Yucat‡n</b></font>
<p>
Dominated by the towering steps of the four-sided Pyramid of Kukulc‡n, also called El Castillo, Chichen Itza is one of the Yucat‡n's most impressive Mayan sites. Spreading out across a vast, park-like area, its buildings are testament to the advanced state of Mayan culture. The delicately carved mosaics of the Nunnery annex date from its earliest phase from 600-900 A.D., while the Temple of the Warriors, bristling with columns, reflects the Toltec influence during the last phase of building from 1000-1250 A.D.
<p>
Chichen ItzaÕs features include the largest ball court in ancient Mexico, a round-walled astronomical observatory, and the Temple of the Jaguars, with its enormous serpent columns and jaguar throne. The ball court is known for its fine acoustics. Cenotes, natural wells in the limestone, are depositories of gold and jade, as well as human beings, who were thrown in to appease the gods.
<p>
Those planning a visit during the spring and fall equinoxes, will see a serpent shape down the steps of El Castillo, caused by the play of sun and shadow on the stones. This phenomenon, a tribute to Mayan astronomy, is reenacted almost nightly via a spectacular sound-and-light show. The mile by mile-and-a-half site contains endless massive structures, and intricate sculptures.
<p>
Recent excavations have uncovered a second temple dedicated to Venus, the planet Mayan astronomers followed in scheduling their wars.
<p>
Chichen Itza, about 75 miles east of MŽrida, Yucat‡n, is well worth an overnight stay, visitors can opt for one of the hotels within walking distance of the site or, for more economical accommodations in Valladolid, about 12 miles away.
<p>
Uxmal, halfway between Campeche and MŽrida, is known for its exquisite sense of proportion and the thousands of hand-carved stones fitted into its buildings' facades. Development of a local type of cement allowed for the use of wide arches, huge gateways and impressive rooms. The Temple of the Magician, reputed to have been built by supernatural means, is decorated with rain-god masks, intricate mosaics and rich latticework. It is unique for its oval shape and the Mayan legend of its creation, which claims a sorcerer dwarf built it in a day. Uxmal's Palace of the Governors is crowned by a dazzling geometrical frieze made from 20,000 cut stones. Because the buildings are so finely patterned, the sound and light show here is quite impressive.	
<p>
In the Pu'uc Hills south of MŽrida stand some of the most elegant structures of the Mayan World. Intricate geometrical designs of cut and carved limestone are the hallmark of the "Pu'uc style" that characterizes the sites of Kabah, Sayil, and Labna.
<p>
Kabah's highlight is the Codz-Pop temple, embellished with a repeating mosaic of masks portraying the long-nosed rain god, Chac. At Sayil, delicate carvings combined with columns and pleasing proportions give its three-story palace a classic beauty reminiscent of ancient Greek temples. Labna's famous archway, marking the beginning of a sacbe, or roadway, to Uxmal, is covered with carvings that include stylized pictures of Mayan houses, remarkably similar to those found in the Yucat‡n today.
<p>
Other Yucat‡n archaeological sites include Dzibilchaltœn, north of MŽrida, continuously occupied since about 650 B.C. Izamal, east of MŽrida, features one of the Peninsula's largest pyramids, and Edzn‡, south of MŽrida, noted for its restored five-story pyramid and extensive system of canals.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Quintana Roo</b></font>
<p>
If Chichen Itza awes the observer with its size and complexity, Tulum charms with its location on a limestone cliff above the turquoise splendor of the Caribbean. Located about 75 miles south of Cancœn in the state of Quintana Roo, Tulum is the only completely walled Mayan settlement known.
<p>
This small collection of temples on a bluff overlooking the turquoise Caribbean served as a major trading center and port for the 4,000 or so Mayan canoes that plied the seas from Veracruz to Honduras. Laden with feathers, furs, jade, medicinal herbs, salt, and honey, these canoes navigated a network of inland canals dug by the Maya to facilitate travel. Tulum's largest temple, El Castillo, served as a lighthouse to guide mariners through an opening in the coral reef.
<p>
Tulum was also the jumping off point for pilgrimages to the island of Cozumel, home to the shrine honoring the moon goddess. Over the doorway of Tulum's Temple of the Frescoes is carved a small "diving" figure, which is supposed to represent the "honeybee god" to which Tulum was dedicated since honey was one of its important exports. 
<p>
About 25 miles inland from Tulum, Coba, meaning "water stirred by wind" in Mayan, was one of the most important Mayan cities in the region from about 650 to 1000 A.D. It was a hub for an impressive system of roads, including a raised causeway more than 30 feet wide. Its many structures include the tallest pyramid in the Mayan World. From the top of Nohoch a vast green carpet of jungle unfolds.
<p>
 It was an important regional capital in the 8th century with a population of 55,000. The city was linked to other towns by an extensive network of sacbeob, or raised and paved stone causeways. The one that stretches from Coba to Yaxuna, 65 miles away, is the longest remaining Mayan sacbe.
<p>
Though off the beaten track, the cluster of ruins at Kohunlich some 40 miles from Chetumal in the lower Yucat‡n Peninsula is no less stunning than some of the more famous sites. Discovered in 1971, Kohunlich is set among lush forests punctuated with orchids and ferns. Here you'll find three immense plazas surrounded by buildings, a ball court, and a main temple whose stairway is flanked by huge, colorful masks of the sun god. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Chiapas</b></font>
<p>
Topped by pierced "roof-combs" to make them appear taller, the graceful temples of Palenque are set against a backdrop of jungle-covered mountains. Wild bird calls and the splashing of a river hidden in the rainforest add to the green mansion-like ambience of this site, considered by many to be the most beautiful in the world.
<p>
In 1952 the discovery of a jade-laden royal tomb beneath the Temple of the Inscriptions made world headlines because it was the first tomb ever found beneath a pyramid in the Americas. Palenque is likewise famous for its superb relief carvings on large panels, one of which portrays a corn plant deity in the shape of a cross.
<p>
To see the finest examples of Mayan mural painting, visitors must venture to Bonampak deep in the jungle of southwestern Yucat‡n. Its Temple of the Frescoes holds the Mayan world's finest murals, depicting people from many levels of its society. Though getting here requires an adventurous trip by small plane or Land Rover from Palenque, followed by two or three hours of hiking, the murals reward the effort.
<p>
Any good guidebook or map will point the way to hundreds of more sites in varying degrees of restoration. Any one of them could contain the evidence that would once again radically reshape everything we thought we knew about the mysteries of Mundo Maya.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Additional Attractions</b></font>
<p>
The Cancœn-Tulum corridor along Highway 307, running south for 100 miles, is the road which links the mysteries of the Mayan ruins of Tulum with the beach resorts of Cancœn, Cozumel, Isla Mujeres, Playa del Carmen, Puerto Aventuras, Puerto Morelos, Punta Bete and Akumal. It leads visitors to even more fascinating and unique attractions. 
<p>
One of these is Xcaret, a watersports park where all sun protection and tanning lotions are collected at the entrance and given back upon leaving. Located about 45 miles south of Cancœn, this privately-owned park with its impeccably manicured tree-lined landscapes is a paradise filled with many exciting and fun activities for the whole family to enjoy. The park features recently excavated Mayan ruins, an underground river that meanders for more than 1,000 feet through impressive caverns full of multihued tropical fish, cenotes, a natural inlet, a breakwater, a private beach and a dolphin cove where visitors can swim with the dolphins.
<p>
Other special attractions worth a visit include Palancar Aquarium, featuring informative exhibits on the area's marine life and environment and located 20 miles south of Cancœn. Next door to the aquarium is Croco Cun, a crocodile farm. The Dr. Alfredo Barrera Mar’n Botanical Garden, located just outside of Puerto Morelos some 22 miles south of Cancœn, features species of flora indigenous to the region, a nature trail and a small archaeological site. Xel-H‡, a national park located 76 miles south, features a natural aquarium sculpted out of the limestone coastline and a tiny zoo with local wildlife.

<center><font size=+2>MAZATLAN OFFERS VARIETY--GREAT BEACHES, FISHING, SPORTS</font></center>
<p>
One of the oldest resorts on the Pacific coast, Mazatlan has earned a reputation as one of Mexico's most popular and active beach communities. It is a bustling commerical port of 300,000 that is renowned for its fine sport fishing, clean beaches, sunny climate and excellent dining and night life. Less sophisticated than other Pacific resorts, it is noted for its outstanding service and wide variety of accommodations.
<p>
Mazatlan is a carefree kind of place where mariachis will strike up the band in a parking lot and people will start to dance on the beach. Visitors, most of whom are from California and Texas, take their surfboards on the bus and live in cut-off jeans. In February, it is also the scene of one of the best carnavales in Mexico. 
<p>
The resort covers much of a 15-mile peninsula in the State of Sinaloa. It features a natural bay and has a sheltered harbor.  The original settlement and port area, called "Old Mazatlan," is situated on the southern tip of the peninsula. El Centro, Mazatlan's downtown area, is punctuated by a small yet charming zocalo and a cathedral with its brightly colored yellow and blue mosaic towers. To the north lies the Zona Dorada, or the Golden Zone, stretching from Camaron Point north to the Costa de Oro is visited by more than a million tourists a year. A palm-lined malecon (beachfront promenade), the longest in Mexico, connects the two areas.
<p>
Once the home of the Totorames Indians, Mazatlan, which means "land of deer" in Nahuatl, also attracted Pacific Coast pirates who, according to legend, buried their treasures in the coves up and down the coast near the city. A few Spaniards settled there in the early 1600s, but the town had no municipal government until 1837. A group of enterprising Germans developed the town's port to import agricultural equipment, and by the end of the 19th century, Mazatlan was engaging in international trade with places as distant as the Orient.
<p>
Today, this city of 500,000 residents supports the largest shrimp-fishing fleet in Latin America.  Tons of shrimp are frozen there daily and shipped off to the United States.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>FISHING</b></font>
<p>
Mazatlan is a top destination for deep-sea fishing.  Charters are available for striped marlin in the winter months, swordfish in the spring, sailfish in the spring and early summer, and tuna year-round. A record 98-pound black marlin and a 203-pound sailfish have been pulled from the waters off Mazatlan.  For anglers who prefer catch-and-release fishing, all fleet captains in Mazatlan are familiar with this technique.
<p>
The port hosts numerous large sport-fishing fleets, many with more than 30 years' experience, offering Mexico's finest fishing charter services. For more information about fishing in Mazatlan, contact Star Fleet at INT-52-69-82-38-78.
<p>
Travelers who don't wish to fish can still enjoy the warm waters and fair weather of Mazatlan by swimming, surfing, jet-skiing, parasailing and scuba diving. Ten miles of beaches stretch from Old Mazatlan up the coast past the Zona Dorada, where some of the most popular beaches are Playa Los Sabalos and Playa Las Gaviotas. North of Zona Dorada are some quieter beaches, such as Playa Las Brujas and Playa Los Cerritos.
<p>
Mazatlan is one of the only resorts in Mexico that permits surfing on town beaches. The waves are best at Los Pinos, north of the fort, known in surfing circles as "the Cannon," as well as at Playa Los Gaviotas and Playa Los Sabalos.
<p>
At the famous diver's cliff, tourists hearts race as they watch daring locals plunge into 45 feet of turbulent water surrounded by rocks. The dive requires expert timing, because without a high wave, the waters are only six feet deep. Diver's cliff is located on Claussen Boulevard near the Monument to the Women of Mazatlan, which pays tribute to the beauty of the local women.
<p>
While sport-fishing and body-building events are held throughout the year in Mazatlan, the city's most famous party occurs the week before Ash Wednesday, during a celebration known as the Carnaval of Mazatlan, the third-largest pre-Lenten festival in the world. In November, the State of Sinaloa has its cultural festival, and Mazatlan is alive with folk dances, music, opera, theater and art shows.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>ZONA DORADA</b></font>
<p>
The Zona Dorada is Mazatlan's newly developedn tourist center, where visitors find an exciting atmosphere at night in the zone's bars, restaurants and discos. The town's newest luxury resorts are located here, and the shops cater to tourists, offering them all the amenities to make their visit relaxing and enjoyable. The Mazatlan Arts & Crafts Center, at the northern end of the zone, is an excellent market for browsing and bartering.
<p>
On Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights, the Playa Mazatlan Hotel offers a Fiesta Mexicana, which includes a free buffet and drinks, a folk-dance show, live music and dancing.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>OLD MAZATLAN</b></font>
<p>
Old Mazatlan is still the civic, religious and commercial center of Mazatlan. The city's beautiful 19th-century cathedral is located in Plaza Revolucion, Mazatlan's zocalo. Centuries-old buildings have been restored, including the historic Angela Peralta Theater. In the Plaza Republica, band concerts are played weekly.  
<p>
The Archaeological Museum contains hundreds of pre-Columbian relics, and the Mazatlan Aquarium is home to more than 300 species of fish, including sharks, eels and seahorses.  Next to the aquarium there's a playground and small zoo that sits amid the trees in the botanical garden. The lively Central Market sells everything from souvenirs to food. On Sundays from Christmas through Easter, vistors can take in a bullfight at the Plaza de Toros La Monumental.
<p>
The city's most famous landmark, the Fishermen's Monument, is located in the center of the old resort strip north of Playa Olas Atlas. An old Spanish fort, Fuerte Carranza, just west of downtown, adjacent to Playa Los Pinos, is where Mazatlan defended itself from French invaders in the 1860's. At the southern end is the old lighthouse, the second-tallest in the world after Gibraltar's, where the fishing fleet is berthed. For a panoramic view of it all, head for Icebox Hill, a former military observation point. A half block from Olas Atlas is the City Museum. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>SIDE TRIPS</b></font>
<p>
On most Sundays, in neighboring villages of Mazatlan, such as Llanito, tourists can witness a tournament of the ancient ball game ulama, which dates back to the dawn of Mesoamerican civilization. Today, this game only survives in the State of Sinaloa around Mazatlan, where it has been passed down through the generations.
<p>
From the center of Old Mazatlan, the Playa Sur bus goes to El Faro, reputedly the second-largest natural land beacon in the world. From this point, visitors have a spectacular view of Mazatlan and the Pacific Ocean. For the adventurous traveler, it is an enjoyable 30-minute hike to the point.
<p>
Jungle tours and excursions that show off different facets of Mexico leave regularly from most hotels to the Teacapan River, an area filled with tropical flowers. Tours begin with a drive through agricultural regions, where the cultivation of mangoes, sugarcane, bananas and coconuts dominates the scenery. 
<p>
After making stops in Rosario and Teacapan, travelers leave the bus and board a covered catamaran for a trip upriver into a jungle of mangroves. The swampy terrain harbors alligators, snakes, jaguars, bobcats and iguanas. Sometimes, playful dolphins provide an escort, leaping from the water around the boat. Other sites include the San Blas jungle, and Tovara, whose system of canals extends into a canyon.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>EXCURSIONS</b></font>
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Concordia and Copala</b></font>
<p>
Just outside of Mazatlan are Concordia and Copala, two small, charming towns. Mexico's Route RF40, the first road south of the U.S. border to cross the Sierra Madre mountains, offers travelers fantastic vistas as they travel to these towns.
<p>
Concordia, 28 miles east of Mazatlan, is a delightful former mining town known for its ceramics and its wonderful, hand-made furniture, especially its rocking chairs. Copala, 55 miles east of Mazatlan, is another historic mining village that is worth a visit. On Sundays, local families from Mazatlan travel to this cobble-stoned-street town to enjoy a day in the country.  Visitors can picnic or visit to Daniel's Restaurant for lunch.  The restaurant serves an excellent banana coconut cream pie, and, if asked nicely, Daniel will be more than happy to share his special recipe.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Mexcaltitan</b></font>
<p>
About 136 miles south of mazatlan lies the remote island village of Mexcaltitan, poetically named "The Venice of Mexico" because you must get there by boat.  
<p>
Its main street, fittingly called Calle de Venecia, is full of cracked-stone houses, sweet-smelling capiro trees and friendly natives.  Legend has it that Mexcaltitan was discovered by the Aztecs before they moved east into the country's interior.  
<p>
They called the island Aztlan, "place of the herons," and created a circular, geometrically precise town representing their vision of the universe as reflected in their calendar. Some say Mexcaltitan was the model for their great capital Tenochtitlan, later built where Mexico City now stands.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>ISLAND HOPPING</b></font>
 <p>
Boat rides to three nearby islands are available from the El Cid Megaresort. Isla de los Venados and Isla de los Chivos are quiet and undisturbed, perfect for water sports.  Isla de los Pajaros is popular for birdwatching with hundreds of species nesting on the island.
<p>
Travelers can head south to Isla de la Piedra for its tropical, palm-lined beaches and South Seas atmosphere. This is a favorite Sunday gathering place for Mexican families.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>ACCOMMODATIONS</b></font>
<p>
An increasingly popular tourist destination, Mazatlan has more than 140 hotels and 8,500 rooms, with an additional 2,000 rooms planned for the near future. Mazatlan has excellent accommodations to fit every budget, but visitors looking for luxury have some exciting choices.
<p>
The restored Rancho Las Moras (INT-69-16-50-44), a 19th-century tequila hacienda, is a first-class resort located on the outskirts of Mazatlan in the Sierra Madre mountains. The 150-year-old hacienda consists of a main house containing six villas with private terraces, servants' quarters, a tequila-processing area, storage facilities, five small casitas with private kitchens and baths, and a whitewashed, open-air church overlooking the countryside.
<p>
The resort's ranch is one of Las Moras's most interesting features. Rare and exotic animals--ranging from miniature horses to llamas--roam the 3,000 acres of lush terrain. Horse-drawn carriages and wagons, including mini-buggies for children, can be taken around the ranch for sightseeing or overnight adventures.
<p>
The El Cid Megaresort (800/525-1925) is the largest privately-owned resort in Mexico, with its 1,000 rooms spread over 900 acres. The resort is divided into three separate hotels: the Granada Country Club, which has impressive homes and villas that can be rented; El Moro Beach Hotel, which has not only luxury suites but a private penthouse with a helicopter landing pad; and the Castilla Beach Hotel, which has more luxury accommodations. All the hotels have five-star restaurants, bars, discos, tennis courts and pools.
<p>
The multi-million-dollar El Cid Marina project will be completed soon. The marina will feature a Venetian-style harbor with a capacity for 120 yachts, with several luxury hotels, including the five-star Hotel Marina El Cid, which has 400 rooms, 150 condominiums, a full-service yacht club with health-club facilities, and a gourmet restaurant. Bel-Air Hotels will also have a property on an island in the marina. The El Cid Port, another part of the project, will feature a series of navigable canals and small bridges to interconnect the different development tracts along the existing golf course. Three large hotels also are planned next to the El Cid Port on the east side of the marina.
<p>
Mazatlan also has a great variety of other luxury hotel and resort options. Luxurious five-star hotels include the Camino Real Mazatlan, Pueblo Bonito, Playa Mazatan, and Costo de Oro. 
<p>
For the budget-conscious traveler, Mazatlan offers several inexpensive yet comfortable accommodations. There also are many RV parks, from beachfront to 
centrally-located, that offer a variety of services.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>GETTING THERE</b></font>
<p>
The Rafael Buelna International Airport serves Mazatlan and is located 17 miles southeast of the hotel and resort area. Frequent van transfers are available from the airport to most hotels at reasonable rates. 
<p>
Delta is the only U.S. airline that flies directly into Mazatlan from Los Angeles. Most U.S. airlines offer connecting flights to Mazatlan through Mexico City. Mexicana and Aeromexico offer daily flights into Mazatlan from various parts of Mexico.

BACKGROUNDER
<p>
<center><font size=+2>THE BUSINESS SIDE OF MEXICO</font></center>
<p>
Mexico has a sophisticated culture with an amazingly advanced and complex economic system. The complexity of this system is what makes doing business there such a challenge.
<p>
While on the surface doing business in Mexico may seem similar to that of the U.S. and major European markets, underneath it is completely different. All decisions are usually made by the top person of the company. If he or she is not available, the decision cannot be made. Also, business protocol is formal. 
<p>
Because titles are important in Mexico, businesspersons should address everyone formally to show respect until the individual has asked to be referred to by his or her first name. Many Mexican businesspersons are highly educated and are referred to by the business title of Liceniado (meaning college graduate).
<p>
Formality extends to dress also, especially in the larger business centers of Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey.  Men wear dark suits, and women, dressing conservatively in tailored and subdued styles, should keep relationships formal. However, in the provincial cities, especially in the hot tropics, most men wear only a light cotton shirt and slacks and wear women a blouse and skirt. Though they may look casual, they are strictly formal when conducting business.
<p>
All important business is usually conducted in Spanish and it is best for non-Spanish speaking businesspersons to bring an interpreter rather than struggle with English or some other language when closing important deals.
<p>
Mexico is a country where business is done with "friends." On the whole, a handshake means more than any contract. A businessperson's chosen business associates will bend over backward to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.
<p>
Those experienced in the ways of Mexican business often say that anything less than a partnership in Mexico doesn't work. For this reason joint ventures have become increasingly popular.
<p>
To a Mexican, family is everything. It is the glue that holds together the fabric of society during crises. The Mexican concept of "familia" means more than its literal translation of family. The Mexican's family, which frequently includes several generations, is his or her main source of pride and joy.
<p>
Social life commonly centers around family get-togethers, and marriages are often business alliances between families. It's for this reason that most of Mexico's largest corporations are still family owned.
<p>
In Mexico, the family is the centerpiece of life. Mexicans place a great deal of importance on the social aspect of business, deciding whether or not they want to do business with a particular person. Aggressive sales tactics and hard sell usually flop. 
<p>
It is an honor to be invited into the home of a Mexican host, especially on Sunday for a family activity. It is customary to bring a gift for the lady of the house. Guests should not take offense if their host does not open their gift right away. This is considered rude in Mexico, where gifts are thought to be personal.
<p>
The Mexican businessperson's system of priorities is family and social obligations first and business later. In general, the Mexican business environment is more easygoing than that in most other countries. But easygoing charm is not the same as laziness. Mexicans usually deal with things one step at a time.
<p>
For instance, lunch is a time when Mexicans take the opportunity to judge their business counterparts on their control and on their attention to family and social concerns. Conversation rarely touches on the specifics of business. Talk of family and friends is the rule. 
<p>
As far as appointments are concerned, it is best for businesspersons to secure a lunch or dinner meeting and be prepared to spend a good while as it is traditional to conduct business over a long meal. Businesspersons should be sure not to schedule another appointment directly following the meal and no appointments should be made on Sunday, traditionally a family day.
<p>
Besides business lunches, most fine restaurants serve breakfast in Mexico City where businesspersons discuss deals over "power" breakfasts, turning many an elegant restaurant into a "board room."
<p>
As in many countries, good secretaries are often the "gatekeepers" of high-level Mexican executives. It pays to spend a few minutes with a secretary before an important meeting. They often will reveal some helpful hints on dealing with their boss. Giving one a small gift of a candybar is not uncommon.
<p>
In the major business centers of Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey, traffic can be horrendous at most times of the day. Allow plenty of time for travel to meetings. In Mexico City, a centrally-located hotel is a must. Mexicans do not like it when they have to wait for their foreign counterparts.
<p>
Mexicans take great pride in their businesses. Business pride is sometimes demonstrated to the extreme. Mexican workers are dedicated to working until the job is done, however long it takes. Most work until 19:00 or 20:00 o'clock. When Mexicans get down to business, they do it with effortless speed and efficiency.
<p>
The word "deadline" has a somewhat different meaning in Mexico. Every contract has an implied granting of an extension for important events. Deadlines should be flexible.
<p>
Red tape can be a stumbling block for most foreigners doing business in Mexico. They fear that even when requirements are met, an arbitrary and occasionally capricious government official might stop them from moving ahead. The rule is to be sure to comply with the requirements correctly the first time because the appeal procedures are somewhat limited and penalties for violating the rules are substantial.
<p>
Since signing the NAFTA agreement, Mexico has done away with the more complicated business visa, at least for U.S. citizens. Under the new procedure, businesspersons simply fill out a short business travel card similar to the tourist card currently used for recreational travel. This 30-day no-fee business travel card, to be used along with a valid passport, is issued by Mexican consulates, travel agencies, and airlines and is collected at the point of entry.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>FACILITIES FOR BUSINESS TRAVELERS</b></font>
<p>
As Mexico becomes a noted center for international business, the level of service for the business traveler has risen markedly. Hotels are renovating or constructing state-of the art facilities to accommodate every need of world-class business travelers.
<p>
Executive floors have become common in the larger luxury hotels. While each varies in decor and ambiance, all offer spacious rooms with king-size beds, a private executive lounge where a complimentary continental breakfast is served, and private check-in. Most also have limited access through keyed elevators.
<p>
Business centers have also become the norm in many hotels. Mexico City, for example, currently has 14 hotels with centers equipped with computers, fax machines, copiers, secretarial help, conference rooms, and more. One of the forerunners in this area is Fiesta Americana Hotels. Some, like the chain's flagship property, the Fiesta Americana Reforma Hotel, offer computer and typewriter rental, as well as translation services.	
<p>
Mexico is working hard to create an infrastructure that offers comfort and efficiency to business travelers, speeds business and leisure travelers on their way, and keeps them in touch with the world. International carriers arrive regularly from world capitals and a well-developed domestic air transportation system takes travelers quickly and easily to regional centers within Mexico.  
<p>
Mexico's highway construction program is the largest in the history of Latin America.  Three thousand miles of new highways and bridges are being built and a growing network of superhighways makes surface transportation fast and rewarding. A burgeoning telecommunications system stays up-to-the-minute as Telefonos de Mexico installs thousands of new fiber optic payphones throughout all major cities and extends its fiber optic network across the country.  Finally, the hotel industry is currently executing an extensive training campaign for hotel personnel and recently adopted international hotel rating standards in cooperation with AAA.

<center><font size=+2>MEXICO CITY: A GREAT CITY FOR MORE THAN  3,000 YEARS</font></center>
<p>
A great city doesn't just happen; it evolves. The greater the city the deeper and more fascinating is its history. MŽxico City is no exception. Political, cultural and economic center, capital of the nation and its largest city, Mexico City is filled with the remains of civilizations dating back 3,000 years.  These stand side-by-side with the newest technological advances, preparing this metropolis for its future in the 21st century.
<p>
This magnificent city of wide, shady boulevards lined with modern glass and steel buildings spiced with touches of the past, is also the oldest and the highest capital city (7,349 feet above sea level) in North America.  It is also the world's most populous city with more than 25 million inhabitants.  
<p>
MŽxico City, or MŽxico, as it is affectionately known to its inhabitants, presents three distinct cultures to the visitor--Aztec, Spanish and Mexican--all blending amid modern skyscrapers, highways and an extensive modern subway system.  
<p>
But it also has an international flavor evident in its many chic shops and restaurants. Store shelves lined with imported goods, contemporary rock concerts and a myriad of fast food eateries attract thousands of visitors a year. It is this blend of old and new that makes the city so unique and sets it apart from other capitals of the world.  
<p>
Set dramatically in the Valley of MŽxico, it was first settled by nomadic Indians, the Tenochcas or Mexicas, who in 1325, as legend has it, built a city on a large island where they saw an eagle perched on a cactus while eating a snake. They interpreted this as a sign of the promised land. This became Tenochtitlan, built on several islands in what was then Lake Texcoco. The city's ceremonial center of colossal temple-topped white pyramids, palaces, gardens and wide avenues, were all connected to lakeshore satellite towns by a well-engineered network of canals and causeways. 
<p>
As the population grew, the Aztecs built floating islands by filling huge wicker rafts with soil. Eventually these floating islands became the land mass where Mexico City is now located. By the end of the 15th century, it had become an important trade center and a city of wealth and beauty.   
<p>
The city, surrounded on three sides by majestic mountains and such snow-covered volcanoes, as Popocatepetl to the southeast, thrived until Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortez and his army of 400 soldiers entered it in 1519. Terrified by Cortez's 16 horses and the fact that Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god of civilization, was, according to legend, supposed to return that same year, Moctezuma II, the Aztec emperor, met Cortez with rich gifts and offered no resistance.  
<p>
"We saw such wondrous sights we knew not what to say or whether they were real," wrote one of Cortez's soldiers on his arrival in Tenochtitlan. "Canoes filled the lake, causeways led from shore to shore and in the distance shimmered the great City of Mexico."  
<p>
After the death of Moctezuma, a battle, at what is now called the Plaza of the Three Cultures, and an ensuing siege, the city fell to the Spaniards in 1521. Cortez built his colonial capitol on top of the old Aztec one. Unfortunately, the unstable soil has caused many of these heavy colonial buildings to partially sink into the loam.  
<p>
In recent years, efforts have been made to preserve and excavate the beautiful Aztec pyramids and other ruins beneath the city. Many of the ruins were discovered during the construction of the city's subway system; about a decade ago, electrical workers laying cables found an eight-ton monolith in the historical center that was part of a principal Aztec temple.
<p>
Remnants of the city's turbulent past--occupation by England, Spain, France, a revolution and a civil war--can still be seen at Chapultepec Castle, site of the Monumento de los Ni–os Heroes (Monument to the Heroic Children), and the city's enormous square, the Zocalo.
<p>
While the capital's appeal is timeless, its sheer size--over 1,000 square miles--makes it somewhat intimidating to the newcomer. MŽxico City is not easily conquered. It is so big that it can take weeks to explore it in its entirety. To get a sense of the city, the best option is to tackle the areas containing the biggest concentration of attractions.  
<p>
MŽxico City is old and new, complex and simple. It is a collection of villages known as colonias, each offering different sights and sounds. By sampling only four or five of the city's colonias--El Centro, the Historic Center, with its Zocalo, the National Palace and Cathedral; the Zona Rosa, or Pink Zone, an area of chic boutiques, hotels and restaurants; the Paseo de la Reforma leading to Chapultepec Park, the largest urban park in the world; and colonial San Angel and Coyoacan in the city's southern portion--it is possible to find its essence.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>El Centro--The Historic Center </b></font>
<p>
At the heart of MŽxico City's historic center, comprising 600 blocks, is the Plaza de la Constitucion (Constitution Square), also known as the Z—calo. The largest square in the Americas, it is the meeting place and focal point of the city. Before the arrival of the Spaniards, it was the site of the Halls of Moctezuma and was the core of the Aztec world. On the square's north side are the impressive Cathedral of Mexico and the Sagrario.  
<p>
The Metropolitan Cathedral, an encyclopedia of artistic styles taking over three centuries to construct, dominates the square. Combining the Spanish Renaissance and early 19th century neoclassical style of the French, it features the Altar de los Reyes (Altar of the Kings), considered to be one of the best examples of Mexican colonial art and the Altar del Perdon (Altar of Pardon), both built and carved by Jeronimo de Balbas in 1737. Paintings surrounded by golden columns, sculptures, moldings, angels and other Baroque ornamentations decorate the interior.  
<p>
The Sagrario is the Cathedral's church, built in the 18th century. The National Pawn Shop, built more than two centuries ago, is nearby. The National Palace, one of the first buildings built by Cortez on the east end of the Z—calo, houses offices of the President and Finance Ministry. A vision of daily life in pre-conquest Tenochtitlan is vividly portrayed by Diego Rivera in his mural "El Gran Tenochtitlan", seen on the second floor of the National Palace amid some of the artist's best, but unfinished, epic murals. City Hall lies directly across from the Zocalo, and the nearby National Arts Museum exhibits a wide range of Mexican art in 22 exhibit halls.
<p>
But the most impressive testimony of the Aztec period, located just off the Zocalo, are the ruins of the Templo Mayor de Tenochtitl‡n (the Great Temple of the Aztecs), destroyed by the conquistadores and now an open-air museum. In 1978, a power company crew burying a cable, came upon a huge altar stone buried where the temple had stood. A massive archeological dig revealed hundreds of artifacts, including lifesize figures of eagle warriors along with the skulls of their sacrificial victims are now displayed in the new Templo Mayor Museum behind the site. One of the most intriguing finds is an eight-ton stone disc representing Coyolxauhqui, Goddess of the Moon.  
<p>
The main street of the historicic center is Avenida Francisco Madero. Once known as the "Street of the Silversmiths," it has, since colonial times, been a shopping street. The ornate, and recently renovated Casa de los Azulejos (House of Tiles), formerly a viceregal palace, now contains several restaurants and shops.  
<p>
Just west of the House of Tiles is the magnificent Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts). A monument to art deco, completed in 1934 after 30 years of construction, it is both an art gallery and opera house, a place to admire the paintings of Diego Rivera, Jose Climente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. This impressive marble palace is both home to the world-famous Ballet Folklorico, and the Mexican symphony and opera. The theater's stunning stained-glass curtain showing the volcanoes surrounding Mexico City was designed by Tiffany of New York.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Reforma/Chapultepec Park</b></font>
<p>
The elegant tree-lined Paseo de la Reforma, laid out in the 1860s by Emperor Maxmillian, spans downtown MŽxico City from west to northeast. Inspired by 
Paris's Champs Elysees, the boulevard, originally designed to connect Maxmillian's residence at Chapultepec Castle with the Z—calo, is today lined with office buildings and hotels. Bronze monuments to Columbus, Cuauhtemoc, the last of the Aztec emperors, and others grace its glorietas (traffic roundabouts). The most impressive is the Independence Monument at the entrance to the Zona Rosa, known as El Angelito (the angel), a slender column topped by an eight-ton golden statue of the Goddess of Liberty.  
<p>
The Reforma eventually leads to Chapultepec Park (grasshopper hill to the Aztecs), spanning 2,100 acres. This enormous park, filled with gardens, lawns and woods, was once Maxmillian's hunting grounds, and is now home to a zoo, botanical garden and amusement park. Sundays, when families gather for picnics, boating on the lake, and watching street performers, are especially lively.   
<p>
Beginning with Chapultepec Castle, which now houses the National Museum of History, the park also has the largest concentration of world-class museums in the city. Most famous is the National Museum of Anthropology, with exhibits of artifacts representing 30 centuries of Mexican human evolution. Also in the park are the Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Rufino Tamayo Museum, displaying not only Tamayo's works but also those of more than 160 other contemporary artists. Los Pinos, the official home of the President of MŽxico, is located in the park. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Zona Rosa and Polanco</b></font>
<p>
The Zona Rosa, or Pink Zone, a neighborhood of fancy boutiques, hotels, restaurants, and nightclubs, is located south of the Reforma, about half way between the Zocalo and Chapultepec park. Outdoor cafes give it a European flavor.  
<p>
Bordering Chapultepec Park not far from the Zona Rosa is the chic neighborhood of Polanco where three of the city's finest hotels--Nikko, Intercontinental Presidente, and Camino Real--are located. The area also boasts some of the city's best restaurants. Students and young professionals often meet in its many outdoor cafes and clubs.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Southern Mexico City </b></font>
<p>
Insurgentes Avenue, the longest street in the city, leads  to some of Mexico City's  more attractive suburbs, including San Angel and Coyoac‡n. San Angel, a village of cobble stone streets, walled mansions and beautiful gardens, has retained the gracious ambience of its colonial past. Today, it attracts artists, writers and intellectuals, but is best known for its Bazaar Sabado (Saturday market) where craftsmen sell a wide variety of high quality arts and crafts. Also in San Angel is the famous San Angel Inn, an exquisite restaurant set in a former colonial mansion.  
<p>
About a mile to the east of San Angel in old-fashioned Coyoac‡n is the Frida Kahlo Museum, in her former home.  Kahlo was the wife of artist Diego Rivera. Once a suburb, Coyoacan has been absorbed by the city but still retains its small town flavor. A bit more Bohemian than upscale San Angel, it is reminiscent of Paris's Latin Quarter. Students from the National University live here and its twin shady plazas, Plaza Hidalgo and Jardin Centenatrio are lined with bookstores and cafes serving espresso. Outdoor displays of paintings, handcrafted silver and leather by local artists are common.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>EXCURSIONS FROM MEXICO CITY</b></font>
<p>
For those who wish to venture farther, several destinations outside the city, such as Xochimilco, the Pyramids of Teotihuac‡n, Cuernavaca, and Taxco, are perfect for day or overnight trips.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Xochimilco </b></font>
<p>
The Floating Gardens of Xochimilco, a few miles east of Insurgentes, are a reminder of Mexico City the way it was in Aztec times. Actually, the gardens do not float, but they once did. The Aztecs, needing more farmland, placed earth-covered rafts in the swampy waters and planted vegetables in the soil. Eventually, the roots extended to the lake bottom through the shallow waters. 
<p>
Today, flower-bedecked barges carry passengers along the canals, especially on Sundays. The area's newest attraction, the Ecological Park of Xochimilco, features a fine museum and a look at the restoration of planting areas using age-old techniques.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Teotihuac‡n </b></font>
<p>
Insurgentes Avenue, also leads to Teotihuacan, meaning "place where the Gods are born." This ceremonial center was once one of the most important cities on the continent and thrived from about the sixth to the seventh century. Although much is unknown, there are signs that its people came from the east approximately 2,000 years ago and worshipped the rain god. When the Aztec's discovered the city, it had been long abandoned.  
<p>
The two most impressive structures at Teotihuac‡n are the Pyramid of the Sun, standing 63 meters high, with 365 steps leading to a temple and astronomical observatory on top. The Avenue of the Dead, containing 23 temples, connects it to the Pyramid of the Moon, 43 meters high with 112 steps. The Temple of Quetzalcoatl is filled with sculptural decoration based on the theme of the serpent in motion and contains masks of Quetzalcoatl and the god Tlaloc.  
<p>
The Teotihuac‡n museum showcases artifacts discovered at the site. Exhibits include: a reproduction of a burial site; sculptures of animals thought sacred to the Aztecs such as jaguars, eagles, serpents and frogs; richly ornamented ceramics; and well-preserved fragments of murals showing mythological figures.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Cuernavaca </b></font>
<p>
The "city of eternal spring" has long been a vacation residence for many Mexico City residents and is fast becoming the permanent home to many. Only an hour's drive from Mexico City and 2,000 feet lower in altitude, its year-round spring-like weather and small-town character make it ideal for a day trip or a lengthy excursion.
<p>
Most visitors stroll through the Borda Gardens or the two town plazas. Famed Las Ma–anitas, the best restaurant in town, makes for a pleasant stop after exploring the Palace of Cortez, overlooking the main square. Built by Cortez in 1530, it is now a museum housing Diego Rivera murals and artifacts of the town's history. The nearby Cathedral is one of the oldest in the country, but the decor is among the most modern.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Taxco</b></font>
<p>
Nestled in the mountains of the Sierra Madre halfway between Mexico City and Acapulco is one of MŽxico's most famous colonial cities noted for its fine silversmiths. The red tile roofs, narrow and steep cobblestone streets, gardens and the quaint colonial Santa Prisca Church, all add to Taxco's charm. 
<p>
Taxco became known to international travelers after 1929, when an American named William Spratling began a fledgling silversmith business. Today, nearly 300 silver shops line the streets. Practically all silver jewelry made in Mexico can be traced to the worktables of Taxco. Today, the town has been named a national monument to preserve its rich colonial heritage.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>MŽxico City Hotels</b></font>
<p>
Hotels in MŽxico City range from Gran Turismo, 5-star, to 4-star and smaller colonial residences converted to hotels. Gran Turismo hotels include the Camino Real, Maria Isabel Sheraton, Marquis Reforma, Nikko and the new Four Seasons Regent Hotel. Five-star hotels are Presidente Intercontinental, Clarion Reforma Suites, Continental Plaza Airport, Westin Galleria Plaza, Fiesta Americana Reforma, Imperial, Krystal Rosa, Paraiso Radisson, Royal, Sevilla Palace and Suites Marco Polo. Four-Star hotels are De Cortes, Gran (Howard Johnson) and Magestic (Best Western).
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Getting There:</b></font>
<p>
Mexico City's recently expanded and renovated Benito Juarez Airport is truly an international facility. Located four miles east of the downtown historic center, it offers dozens of shops, two restaurants, an art gallery, several banks and an excellent visitor information center. Airlines serving MŽxico City include Aeromexico which flies daily from Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York, and Tucson. Mexicana also offers regular service from Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Antonio, and San Francisco. TAESA, Mexico's newest airline flies directly from Chicago to six cities in Mexico, and is rapidly increasing its charter business. U.S. carriers serving Mexico City include American, Continental, Delta, United and Alaska Airlines. Other international carriers serving Mexico City include British Airways, Canadian Airlines and Japan Air Lines, among others. Taxis are available at the airport and offer set fares, depending on the area visited in Mexico City.

<center><font size=+2>GREEN ANGELS MAKE HIGHWAYS SAFE IN MEXICO</font></center>
<p>
For visitors coming to Mexico from a foreign country, unable to speak Spanish, and driving on strange roads in an unknown countryside, a breakdown can turn into a nightmare. Unexpected mechanical problems could ruin thousands of trips, if it weren't for an elite group of highway patrols known as the Green Angels.
<p>
In Mexico, the famed Green Angels are doing much to dispel worry and encourage increased tourism throughout the country's vast road and highway system. Under the auspices of Mexico's Ministry of Tourism, the Green Angels have spent the past 34 years assisting thousands of road travelers with everything from mechanical problems to itinerary selection to emergency communications.
<p>
More than a thousand members of the Green Angels operate service centers, radio-equipped vehicles, mobile repair vans and radio bases throughout Mexico. In the beginning, the patrols operated only near the U.S. border. Today, they patrol more than 30,000 miles along 230 designated routes throughout the country's highway system. All are trained paramedics.
<p>
Mexico's dedication to the safety of its visitors inspires a wealth of Green Angels services free of charge. Bus or auto breakdowns, for example, are repaired without charge except for parts and gasoline. If the service vans do not have a needed part, they'll obtain it in the nearest community and return to make timely repairs.
<p>
The Green Angels also offer motorists and motorcoaches emergency gasoline, mechanical assistance, first aid, and via their communications network, help lost travelers get back on track. They also alert motorists to the latest weather and road conditions and provide alternate route suggestions where needed.   When requested in advance, they will escort RV caravans and chartered motorcoaches from the point of entry in Mexico to the final destination.
<p>
Each year every Green Angel representative is required to undergo 1,580 hours of intensive training, which includes Red Cross first aid techniques, updated mechanical know-how and English classes.  
<p>
Nearly 300 radio-equipped vehicles provide emergency communications and assistance for separated parties, lost vehicles and other emergencies. Only four or five are in the shop for maintenance at any one time and each puts on more than 200 miles per day 365 days a year.
<p>
For more information on road conditions and the Green Angels, as well as general highway information, please contact the Mexican Government Tourism Office, Surface Tourism Division in Houston, Texas at (713) 880-8772.

<center><font size=+2>MEXICO: A GOLFER'S PARADISE</font></center>
<p>
Maybe it's the turquoise blue sea just beyond the green or the bright purple bougainvillea blossoms around the edge, or perhaps it's the rustle of palm fronds overhead. One thing's for sure: the lush scenery at most of Mexico's more than 120 golf courses makes it hard for even the pros to concentrate.
<p>
Mexico has always had the elements of a golfer's paradise. The weather and scenery are ideal in both the Pacific coastal area and the temperate central highlands. Here golf is a year-round sport, with many exciting and challenging courses laid out by top-name designers.
<p>
As with most activities in Mexico, golf isn't merely a sport. It's a cultural experience that typifies the country's genius for combining old with new. Old haciendas double as clubhouses while sleek golfcarts silently whisk eager players to their next holes.  
<p>
With more professionally-designed courses completed and dozens in development, business and leisure travelers are now putting from the sprawling metropolis of Mexico City to the sea and desert settings of Los Cabos and the Caribbean resort of Cancun. The degree of difficulty on Mexico's greens also varies dramatically. From the short, fun courses of Club de Golf Acapulco to Baja's Cabo del Sol Golf Club, offering a course which dips down into three canyons, there's a golf game for everyone.    
<p>
FONATUR, the investment arm of the Mexican Government responsible for the development of the country's megaprojects, has been the main driving force behind the explosion of world-class golf courses. In fact, FONATUR's strategy for megaprojects considers the addition of golf courses to be a critical element for both current and future tourism development.
<p>
Though Mexico had a slow start in golf, the pace quicked when Mexico discovered tourism and Percy Clifford discovered golf. Born in Mexico City of English parents, Clifford designed or remodeled 35 golf courses in Mexico, a majority of the early ones. Many of these courses are both beautiful and challenging. 
<p>
Golf leaders worldwide are quickly taking note of Mexico, and more international competitions are being played on its courses. The Los Cabos Celebrity Sports Invitational and the PGA Senior Slam are but two examples of world-class competitions which have recently found their home in Mexico. 
<p>
PGA champions such as Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Tom Wargo, Jim Colbert, Roy Stockton and Tom Shaw have played for a half-million-dollar purse in the PGA Senior Slam. 
<p>
These world-class competitions affirm Mexico's quiet evolution into a golfers' paradise. With spectacular settings, reasonable costs, uncrowded greens, and outstanding courses designed by Jack Nicklaus, Robert Trent Jones Jr., Roy and Pete Dye, Joe Finger, as well as Percy Clifford, Mexico offers some of the best links on the planet. 
<p>
Superb golf is available in or near all of Mexico's prime tourism destinations. Each adds its own unique Mexican touch: seashore vistas, jungle edges, forested mountains, pre-Columbian artifacts, even a water hazard with live alligators.  Among Mexico's tee-time highlights:
<p>
<font size=+1><b>MEXICO CITY AND ENVIRONS</b></font>
<p>
The historic region in and around Mexico City offers dozens of courses, each distinguished by a unique colonial ambience and spring-like weather year-round. 
<p>
Many of these courses in Mexico City are at private country clubs. Most of these require visitors to be a guest of a member. For visiting businessmen or women with Mexican counterparts, the process is much easier as Mexicans are usually only too glad to offer an invitation to play at their club. Visiting players can use the facilities Tuesday through Sunday.
<p>
One of Percy Clifford's courses, the 7,142-yard par 72 18-hole Club de Golf Mexico in the extreme southern part of Mexico City, is the only course in the world to have hosted the World Cup matches more than once. It also hosted the Mexican Open, the most prestigious golf championship in Mexico. 
<p>
The oldest club still operating in Mexico City is Club Campestre del Lago, established in 1906 on the grounds of a former hacienda in the district of Churubusco. But the most accessible is the 18-hole Club de Golf Chapultepec, located just beyond the racetrack in a wealthy suburb near Chapultepec Park. 	
<p>
Some newer country clubs accept outside players on weekends if they present their U.S. golf club membership card. These include Bellevista and Bosques del Lago, both north of Mexico City beyond Ciudad Satelite, and Coral Golf Resorts at Acozac, a considerable distance east of the city off the Puebla highway, and Club de Golf Tlalpan. 
<p>
<b>Cuernavaca</b>
<p>
Southwest of Mexico City, the Los Tabachines Golf Club near Cuernavaca, accessible with a U.S. golf club membership card, offers a pleasant round. Nearby, the lush 9-hole course of the Hotel Cocoyoc, a former hacienda of Hernan Cortez, gives players a chance to practice up for some of Mexico's more demanding courses. It's said that no golf ball ever penetrated the mango trees along its fairways. 
<p>
<b>Valle de Bravo</b>
<p>
The Valle de Bravo area offers two more Percy Clifford-designed courses known for surprises around every dogleg. Club de Golf Avandaro and Rancho Avandaro Country Club, both part of the Avandaro Golf Club and Spa 90 miles east of Mexico City, feature fascinating play amid semitropical flowers, running streams and waterfalls with great valley views. The best time to play is on weekdays.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>GUADALAJARA</b></font>
<p>
An alternative to golfing in Mexico City is Guadalajara, the golf capital of Mexico. It's said that scarcely a day goes by when golf cannot be played there. The mile-high altitude of the central highlands makes for almost perfect golfing weather all year. There are more golf clubs here than anywhere else in Mexico and most accept outsiders. This is probably because of the large (more than 60,000) American retiree population of the city and surrounding suburbs. Several of the better clubs are in the suburb of Chapala, where many Americans live. 
<p>
Texan Joe Finger designed the 18-hole course at the Atlas Sports Club, one of the best, located on the Chapala Highway between the Hotel El Tapatio and the airport. Another, the classic Guadalajara Country Club, is the oldest. There's also the well-manicured Club de Golf Santa Anita, four miles south on the Colima Highway.
<p>
For those who wish to play a lighter round, the 9-hole Chapala Country Club course, nestled between California-style homes built on the downslope of a large mountain overlooking scenic Lake Chapala offers a scenic respite. Golfers also find the 9-hole course at Brisas Country Club just outside Chapala on the road to Guadalajara a quick challenge with a spectacular lake view. The Chula Vista Country Club, five minutes west of Chapala, offers a short but demanding 9-hole course.
<p>
One of the most complete clubs in the area, the 6,730-yard par 72 Bosques de San Isidro Club de Golf, got a boost from Bing Crosby. Crosby, an ardent golfer fell in love with the course and set out to tell the rest of the world about it. Here diehard golfers can play on a professional 27-hole course set in a deep valley amid fruit trees and flowers surrounded by mountains along the Zacatecas highway. After a full day of play, many take in the mineral springs and a refreshing swim in the Olympic-size pool. 
<p>
<b><font size=+1>THE BAJA PENINSULA</font></b>
<p>
With the recent openings of the challenging Cabo del Sol and Cabo Real Golf Clubs in Los Cabos, new standards have been set in integrating spectacular settings with challenging golf and first-class amenities.
<p>
Half a dozen championship courses offer lush landscapes, breathtaking scenery and challenges at each and every hole.  Experts say golf may soon surpass fishing as the number one sport of Baja explorers.  
<p>
<b>Loreto</b>
<p>
Loreto's fame has been as a fishing port on the Sea of Cortes. But when visitors try out the Campo de Golf Loreto, its fame will extend to golf as well. Here, rugged desert terrain and fairways crossed by ocean inlets make for an utterly unique golf experience. The par three 14th hole, the signature hole, is one of the most spectacular ever developed in Mexico. It requires a 205-foot carry over water and has to be seen to be believed.
<p>
<b>Ensenada</b>
<p>
Bajamar is a master-planned resort community that boasts two 18-hole championship courses, both designed in the classic Scottish-links style. The first course, originally designed by Percy Clifford, was recently renovated by David Fleming, enhancing Clifford's original design, while preserving the natural environment. A second course was designed by Robert Von Hagge.  
<p>
<b>Rosarito</b>
<p>
Real Del Mar Golf Club Rosarito has an 18-hole, sloping course on terrain leading into three canyons, with ocean views from 11 of 18 holes.  
<p>
<b>Los Cabos</b>
<p>
Los Cabos, the premier Baja California resort and golf area, lies at the tip of the peninsula, where the Pacific meets the Sea of Cortes. San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, as well as the 18-mile highway corridor that follows the stretch of coast between them, collectively form Los Cabos. The area has an otherworldly atmosphere that distinguishes it from other Mexican resorts--and from other golf locales.
<p>
The Palmilla Golf Club was Jack Nicklaus's first Latin American course, and the one that put the Baja Peninsula on the world golf map. This 6,939-yard par 72 27-hole target-style desert layout was instantly the best course in Mexico when it opened in 1992. Consisting of three sets of nine--Arroyo, Mountain, and Ocean--the course sits beautifully in the mountains, its rough areas dotted with 400-year-old cardon cacti, and every hole has a view of the Sea of Cortez. Nicklaus designed so many signature holes at Palmilla that it plays like an autograph book.
<p>
The 7th hole of the Arroyo course has scared many a golfer. With a 560-yard carry from the back tees over a 200-foot-deep canyon to a long fairway with the sea looming over the horizon, it plays head games on golfers. The 5th hole of the mountain stretches 440 yards to the green, with a trick drive over a yawning chasm to the fairway, which turns right and crosses another larger chasm to the green. With five sets of tees on every hole, often set out like box seats at the opera, Nickalus  gives every golfer options. Even not-so-polished players can have a fine day on this course. The greens are kept crisp, swift and true.
<p>
Two dramatic seaside holes, and three outstanding mountain holes are the signature holes of the 6,945-yard par 72 Cabo Real Resort Golf Course, designed by Robert Trent Jones. It is one of the few in the world that boasts a dramatic backdrop of ocean, desert and mountain scenery and promises to be a centerpiece of Los Cabos resort golf. Situated midway between Cabo San Lucas and San Jose at the Melia Cabo Real Hotel, it features a flower-bedecked rolling green course, in contrast to Nicklaus's desert ones. The par three 14th hole plays down to where the surf laps the shore, followed by a par three across a natural beach, and up on a mountain, holes 4, 5, and 8, are humbling in their grandeur of view and skill requirements.
<p>
The recent international televising of the Senior Grand Slam tournament on the 7,051-yard par 72 Cabo del Sol, or Cape of the Sun, drew worldwide attention to this Jack Nicklaus-designed gem.  
<p>
Cabo del Sol features seven oceanside holes, more than any other course in Mexico. Like Pebble Beach, the look is natural, unforced. Earthworks are kept to a minimum. From the pro tees there are several death-or-glory shots to be played across Bahia de Ballena (Whale Bay), though staggered tees put the holes within reach of the average golfer. Inland holes provide a strategic counterpoint to chasing the ball along the bluffs 40 feet above the sea. The best is the short par-four 11th, its split fairway divided by a massive bowl of sand. 
<p>
Two finishing holes, in Nicklaus's own words, "the two best finishing holes in the world," put Cabo del Sol at the top of Latin American courses. The 17th measures a mere 160 yards but is as thrilling as any mid-length par three in the world. From a clifftop tee, golfers fly their shots over a sandy beach to a pulpit green nestled among sea-blackened rocks. The par-four 18th, a grand left-to-right dogleg, traces the curve of the shore to a large well-protected green, providing a climax to any round.
<p>
Campo de Golf Los Cabos, the original local course is already a sporty little stroke eater. Plans call for extending this to 18 holes on the opposite side of the highway. Campestre Cabo San Lucas, designed by Roy Dye, offers splendid views of the sea, though in area isn't as large as the other courses.
<p>
By the year 2000, there could be as many as 180 holes of golf along the meandering strip of Highway 1 between San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas.
<p>
The Cabo San Lucas Country Club, a Pete and Roy Dye-designed 36-hole course, is situated within a 750-acre community in Cabo San Lucas.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>THE YUCATçN PENINSULA</b></font>
<p>
The Yucat‡n Peninsula has become Mexico's most popular vacation destination thanks to the spectacular resort of Cancun and the white sand and sparkling Caribbean Sea that surround it. 
<p>
<b>Cancun</b>
<p>
Robert Trent Jones Jr. helped pioneer resort golf in Mexico with the Club de Golf Cancun Pok-Ta-Pok, named after an ancient Mayan ball game. Players navigate between and over two deep blue lagoons and find their way past an ancient Mayan ruin that bisects the 12th hole fairway. Laid out between the beach and the lagoon on a stretch of flat sand, it's a pleasant rolling course. However, winds can kick up during the winter months, making it difficult to stay on target.
<p>
Several new resort courses have recently opened in Cancun. The Caesar Park Resort's 18-hole 6,800-yard par 71 course, while beautifully set on landfill next to the lagoon, is somewhat forgiving on the front eleven holes, but offers more of a challenge on the back seven. Fairways are slow due to the special grass needed to cover them. An alligator lives in the water hazard on the 15th hole. Another, the Melia Cancun's 18-hole course, isn't much more than an elaborate chip and put course. 
<p>
The new Hotel Melia Cancun, a bold modern version of a Mayan temple, also offers 23 holes of championship golf.
<p>
<b>Merida</b>
<p>
Merida is home to three 18-hole courses: Club Campestre de Merida; Club de Golf La Ceiba; and the Club de Golf Yucat‡n.  Those visiting Campeche can catch an early round at the Club de Golf Playa Palmas.
<p>
<b><font size=+1>THE PACIFIC COAST</font></b>
<p>
The Pacific coast varies from gentle beaches to rugged cliffs and pounding seas, and golf designers have made brilliant use of all the possibilities.
<p>
<b>Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo </b>
<p>
Ixtapa's spectacular Palma Real course, on the other hand, was also designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr. with fairways and greens butting right up against the beach. This course tests golfers with rolling expanses of fairways and greens rimmed with tall coconut palms and dotted with water holes and three blue lakes. It's also a game preserve with many varieties of gorgeous birds and more than a dozen alligators in the lakes. The final greens hug the edge of the Pacific Ocean.
<p>
The new 18-hole Ixtapa Marina Club de Golf, designed by Robert Von Hagge, is one of two links-style courses in Mexico. From the balcony of the clubhouse, it looks like a series of green bumps devoid of trees with canals running through them. But from the course level, it's a challenging maze of hills and water hazards. Tightly guarded greens and expansive fairways between the "dunes" force golfers to use all the skills they possess.
<p>
<b>Puerto Vallarta</b>
<p>
For golfers headed to Puerto Vallarta, the Los Flamingos Golf Club offers a chance to follow through on a movie star or two. This 18-hole par 72 course is located eight miles north of the airport near some fine hotels.
<p>
A newer 6,500-yard resort course, designed by Joe Finger, crowns the Marina Vallarta megadevelopment. It's open undulating fairways offer even the novice golfer a wide berth for those wayward shots and a challenging layout for better players.
<p>
<b>Manzanillo</b>
<p>
Manzanillo is home to the world-famous resort of Las Hadas, which includes La Mantarraya, a Pete and Roy Dye-designed course, and its newest resort/golf paradise, Isla Navidad.
<p>
The La Mantarraya Golf Links at Las Hadas, a luxury resort run by Camino Real Hotels in Manzanillo is a lush 5,994-yard par 71 18-hole Percy Clifford course that meanders past lagoons, canals, palm trees, and various forms of wildlife. For sheer beauty, as well as difficulty, few courses in the country can come close to La Mantarraya. Set against a backdrop of rugged mountains and the sea, it offers a challenge to all who play it. It was recently redesigned by Pete and Roy Dye and is considered to be among the best and most scenic in the world according to Golf Digest.
<p>
It's possible to play three or four different courses here depending on which set of tees is used. Thirteen holes feature water hazards. The former 17th hole, now the 18th, is one of the most difficult. The new 18th hole, bounded on three sides by the sea, requires a 230-yard carry. Most golfers need at least three dozen balls to finish the course.
<p>
<b>Acapulco </b> 
<p>
Acapulco is Mexico's grand jetset destination, and its golf courses uphold that reputation. The two magnificent courses in Acapulco at the Princess and Pierre Marques Hotels are regarded by many as two of the finest resort courses in Mexico. The first, a 6,355-yard par 72 Percy Clifford design, features water on 12 of its 18 holes, while the second, designed by Ted Robinson, features water on 13 holes and is extremely well bunkered.
<p>
<b>Mazatlan</b>
<p>
Mazatlan, home to the 18-hole El Cid Golf and Country Club, will soon have a new 27-hole course as a part of its new marina development.
<p>
<b>Huatulco</b>
<p>
Huatulco is Mexico's newest major resort area, and much of its development still lies ahead. Its Club de Golf Tangolunda is another spectacular course. Located in a lush coastal area, this 18-hole course was carved out of the jungle and flows from the ocean inland between rolling hills of chaparal along the shore of Huatulco's seven gorgeous bays.

<center><font size=+2>MEXICO'S NORTH--EL NORTE
A LAND RICH IN HISTORY AND CULTURE</font></center>
<p>
El Norte, Mexico's northland, is a land of great distances, a vast, sparsely-populated, semi-arid or mountainous region that contrasts markedly with the rest of the country. It looks different. Its history is different. It is different. To really understand this region, it pays to know where its been.The Mexican northland holds its secrets well. This is a land with an adventurous past, a past filled with bandits, Apache and Comanche raids, Mexican revolutionary battles and assassinations, Spanish conquests, and ruthless fights for gold and silver. It was here that Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, the father of Mexican independence, was killed in 1811.
<p>
Later in the 19th century, the region became the center of the Mexican government when President Benito Juarez moved his armies to Chihuahua to organize the battle to defeat Emperor Maxmillian.  
<p>
This is also the land where the revolutionary/bandit Pancho Villa helped Francisco Madero spark the Revolution of 1910 and the overflow of Porfirio Diaz.  
<p>
Some of the most dramatic sights in Mexico can be seen here: the canyon country of Barranca de Cobre (Copper Canyon), the Basaseachic Falls, and the ruins of Casa Grandes, the Toltec-inspired archaeological area south of Ciudad Juarez.  
<p>
Northern Mexico is considered cattle country, and beef's influence is found in the area's unique cuisine. Norteno-style cooking means charcoal-broiled steaks and thin tortillas made of wheat flour rather than cornmeal. The beef, which comes from Chihuahua, is renowned for its flavor. 
<p>
Horseback riding over the plains of northern Mexico is a popular recreation, as is fishing, hunting, golf, tennis and a variety of water sports. Spectator sports in the region include baseball, horse racing and jai alai.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>NORTHERN CITIES</b></font>
<p>
<b>CIUDAD VICTORIA</b>
<p>
Originally founded in 1750 as Villa de Santa Maria de Aguayo, Ciudad Victoria, named for Mexico's first president, Guadalupe Victoria, is a sportsmen's town and the captial of the State of Tamaulipas.  
<p>
Located 900 feet above sea level in the foothills of the Sierra Madre mountains, Ciudad Victoria is best known for its fishing. Lake Vicente Guerrero has some of the best bass fishing and duck hunting in the country. Excellent fishing can also be found east of Ciudad Victoria, at La Pesca on the Tamaulipas coast between Matamoros and Tampico, and at the Soto La Mariana River, where tarpon weighing up to 35 pounds are found.
<p>
The Plaza Juarez, the main square, is surrounded by the cathedral, the Museum of Anthropology and History, and the modern government palace. The Government Center features murals running the length of the building, depicting the history of Ciudad Victoria. There is small art museum, the Casa del Arte Tamaulipeco, nearby.  <p>
<p>
A major crop of the area is henequen (sisal). Scenic places nearby include La Penita, a spot of rustic beauty, and the falls of Juan Capitan.  
<p>
<b>Accommodations</b>
<p>
In Ciudad Victoria, stay at the San Antonio Hotel which has been completely rebuilt and offers 65 rooms and one suite. The hotel offers moderate prices and a restaurant.

<p>
Southwest of Ciudad Victoria is the Parque Yamatan zoological gardens, which contain a great variety of animals from the region and around the world.   
<p>
<font size=+1><b>CIUDAD VALLES</b></font>
<p>
A railroad center on the Rio Valles and a distribution center for coffee and the heart of the cattle-raising region, Ciudad Valles is located in a region known as "La Huasteca." Founded in 1533 as Villa de Santiago de los Valles de Oxitipa, it was the first Spanish settlement in the State of San Luis Potosi.   
<p>
 Three hours south of Cuidad Victoria on Highway 85, it is surrounded by waterfalls, tropical jungles, volcanic hot springs and Indian villages. Its small hotels are comfortable and quaint, and feature gardens and swimming pools.
<p>
The real attraction of Ciudad Valles is its proximity to towns on the slopes of the Sierra Tamaulipas mountains. These towns are surrounded by thick forest in some of Mexico's most beautiful landscape. Each fall during annual Day of the Dead celebrations, many town residents open their homes to guests, inviting them to visit their altars and share their tamales and tea.

In addition, the Huasteca Anthropology Museum in the village has displays of Huateca culture. The relaxing hot spring of Tamuin is nearby.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>MONTERREY</b></font>
<p>
Monterrey--ranked the No. 1 city in Mexico by Banamex, Mexico's largest banking corporation--is a progressive city, a brewer of beer and a forger of steel. Here visitors won't find the laid-back lifestyle of most of Mexico. 
<p>
Monterrey is a businessman's town. Regiomontanos, as the residents are called, say that the nearest town, Saltillo, is "one hour and three centuries away." In spite of its location in the desert, it has become the great industrial center of northern Mexico, the gateway to the south and the most dynamic city in the country.
<p>
Situated in a 1,767-foot Santa Catarina Valley in the Sierra Madre Oriental flanked by the hulking 7,809-foot Cerro de la Mitra (Mitre Peak) to the west and the distinctive 5,703-foot Cerro de la Silla (Saddle Peak)--the city's emblem--to the east, Monterrey is often referred to as "the Sultan of the North." According to local legend, its valley was created by a local citizen who lost a peso on the uppermost ridge and dug frantically until he found it.
<p>
Monterrey, the captial of the state of Nuevo Leon, is northern Mexico's powerhouse. A bustling, hard-driving, hard-working, wealthy city, it boasts an opera season longer than in any center twice its size in the United States and one of the highest literacy rates in Mexico. The city has nine newspapers, seven T.V. channels and more than 20 radio stations, making it one of the best informed in the country. It's also frequently chosen as the site for Lions Club, Rotary, and Kiwanis Club conventions and regional meetings.
<p>
A favorite weekend destination and a big college town with seven universities, including Monterrey Technological Institute, the MIT of Mexico, it is also one of Mexico's most dynamic industrial centers, producing about 25 percent of the country's manufactured exports.
<p>
<b>Attractions</b>
<p>
Monterrey's attractions combine a strong colonial heritage with modern office buildings and factories that produce steel, cement, glass, textiles and beer. At the center of the renovated Gran Plaza, which has 40 acres of gardens, fountains, monuments and modern buildings, is the Plaza Zaragoza, one of the largest town squares in the world. Bordered by the Colonial Sacred Heart Cathedral, the new Palacio Muncipal and the Palacio de Gobierno on the Esplanada de los Heroes, the plaza is a hub of activity.
<p>
Concerts on the plaza are frequent. Visitors can buy flowers, sit next to the plaza's fountains, attend a show at the theater and shop in an underground mall. Also worthy of visits are the Palacio de Gobierno's museum room and the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo. Nearby is a free-form sculpture by well-known Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo. A number of other galleries and museums are located throughout the city.
<p>
One of the finest examples of colonial architecture in Monterrey is the 1789 Palacio del Obispo, located on Chepe Vara hill, overlooking the town with an impressive mountain backdrop.  It was the center of action during the 1846 Mexican-American War.  Also of interest are the CuauhtŽmoc Brewery and the Cola de Caballo (Horsetail Falls), an impressive triple waterfall accessible on foot or by horse.

<font size=+1><b>SALTILLO</b></font>
<p>
The capital city of the State of Coahuila, Saltillo is a modern industrial city producing pottery, silverware, engine parts, and textiles.   
<p>
Saltillo, easily reached by Highway 40 west of Monterrey, is just three hours south of the Laredo border. The capital of the state of Coahuila, Saltillo was founded in 1575 when Captain Alberto del Canto selected the area as a teaching center for the indigenous people of the north. Under the leadership of del Canto, Saltillo became a colonial center. Today, it has two universities attracting students from around the world.
<p>
During the 18th and 19th centuries, Saltillo served as a staging area for northern expansion as well as the capital of an enormous area extending across what is now Texas to Colorado.  
<p>
The city has retained several examples of its early colonial life. In the southwest part of town, the Cathedral of Santiago, which took over 50 years to build, overlooks the Plaza de Armas and is considered one of the finest examples of churrigueresque (an ornate 18th century Spanish style of decorating) architecture in North America.  
<p>
Other parks and historical sites in Saltillo are the alameda and the Fortress of Carlota. The former, situated west of the Plaza de Armas, contains the Pond of the Republic built in the shape of Mexico. The latter, also located in the old section of town, was dedicated to Maxmillian's wife. The Mercado Juarez, the city's central market, features the colorful serapes for which Saltillo is famous, as well as pan de pulque, a bread baked with pulque from the maguey plant, which also is used to make tequila and mescal.
  <p>
Because of its mild and sunny climate, Saltillo is known as one of the best areas in Mexico for recreation. The cool, refreshing breezes from the surrounding mountains keep temperatures mild providing excellent conditions for active vacationers who like to play tennis or golf. Tennis courts and golf courses are open year-round.

Recently, experts and paleontologists have said they believe that much of the 170-mile desert basin lying between Saltillo and Torreon is an unexplored treasure trove of late Mesozoic Era fossils between 66 million and 75 million years old. By unlocking some of the secrets of the Coahuila region, researchers could find answers to important questions about world distribution of dinosaurs toward the end of their reign.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>SAN LUIS POTOSI</b></font>
<p>
San Luis Potosi, the capital of the state of the same name, was one of the richest towns in 17th-century New Spain due to vast deposits of silver and gold nearby. The Spanish named the city Potosi (a Quechua Indian word meaning richness) after the fabulously wealthy mines in Bolivia when they found the Chichimec Indian town of Tangamaga in 1538. 
<p>
Silver was actually discovered in the nearby town of San Pedro, but the mineral springs in San Luis made it a better place to settle. Religious orders of Franciscans, Jesuits and Carmelites were responsible for the architectural treasures that give San Luis Potosi its character.  
<p>
Benito Juarez made the city his base in the fight against European intervention. During the Mexican Revolution, he condemned Maxmillian to death from the Palacio del Gobierno on the Plaza de Armas, thus ending French rule. Mexico's national anthem was written here in 1854 by Gonzalez Bocanegra.  
<p>
San Luis Potosi is a picturesque and prosperous town with some lovely colonial buildings. The cathedral, located on the central plaza, known as the Jardin Hidalgo, was built between 1670 and 1730 on the site of two earlier churches. One block east of the plaza is the 18th-century Church of Nuestra Senora del Carmen, ornate even by Baroque standards, adorned with shells and multicolored tiles. 
<p>
Two miles west of the zocalo is the Casa de la Cultura, once the residence of a wealthy British mining family. Not to be missed in the Palacio Federal is the Museo de la Mascara, renowned for its exhibits of traditional masks. Visitors should try a local culinary treat called queso de tuna, a sweet paste made from the prickly pear cactus.
<p>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>DURANGO</b></font>
<p>
Since its discovery by the Spanish in 1563, Durango has been a source of precious metals--copper, mercury, gold, lead and silver. All are mined near Durango and the area's iron ore provides raw material for the steel mills of Monterrey. In fact, one of the largest iron deposits in the world is just north of Durango, in El Cerro del Mercado (Market Hill). 
<p>
Located along Route 40, which starts in Matamoros and ends in Mazatlan, the colonial mining town of Durango, with its rugged landscape, has created the perfect frontier look for the making of more than 100 movies--mostly westerns. British, Mexican and American film makers, such as John Ford, have flocked to Durango for its striking backdrop of plains, canyons and arid western towns. 
<p>
Tourists can wander through some of the "Hollywood-like" towns by taking Highway 45 north out of Durango. About nine miles out of the city towards Hidalgo del Parral are two town/sets, complete with saloons, churches and a cemetery: Villa del Oeste and Chupaderos.
<p>
<b>Accommodations </b>
<p>
In Durango, stay at the five-star 100-room Hotel Gobernador at the intersection of Ave. 20 de Noviembre and Apartado. This colonial-style hotel has a swimming pool, restaurant and televisions and phones are in each room. For information, call INT-91-181-13-19-19. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>CHIHUAHUA</b></font>
<p>
Figuratively and literally, Chihuahua is a town built on silver. Its buildings were constructed to exhibit the wealth they bestowed. There is even a rumor that the walls of Chihuahua's oldest buildings contain silver ore.  
<p>
Capital of one of the largest and richest states in Mexico, Chihuahua is an eclectic mixture of several distinct cultures. Its art, architecture and temperament are a collective result of years of influence from pre-Columbian, colonial and western cultures.  
<p>
The topography of the state is no less varied. From rugged desert and mountain terrain on the northern border with the United States to the deeply fissured mountain chains and barrancas (canyons) of the Sierra Madre Occidental in the west, it is no wonder that the land acquired its name, "Chihuahua," from the Tarahumara's word meaning "dry place." <p>
<p>
The city was originally settled by miners who wandered up from the Durango area seeking silver and other precious metals.  But it was not until 1709 that the city, which lies at one end of the famous Chihuahua-Pacific Railroad line, was actually christened. Today, Chihuahua, a city of more than 500,000 people, relies on lumber, agriculture and beef ranches. Its past forms an important part of its present character.  
<p>
Pancho Villa, a native of the state, was headquartered there during the Mexican Revolution. Along with the armies of Emiliano Zapata, another important Mexican revolutionary, Villa was decisive in overthrowing Porfirio Diaz in 1910. Villa's house, Quinta Luz, is a 30-room mansion housing a museum of memorabilia that includes the little touring car (complete with bullet holes) in which the general was driving when he was murdered in 1923.
<p>
Chihuahua is also the city where Father Miguel Hidalgo, a leader of the independence movement whose grito is still heard in plazas across the country on Mexican Independence Day, was executed in 1810, along with his patriot compadres.
<p>
This is an excellent city for a walking tour. The cathedral, dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi, is the most imposing building in the city. 
<p>
<b>Accommodations</b>
<p>
Chihuahua offers visitors a wide variety of accommodations.  Among the best is the 196-room five-star Palacio del Sol located at Ave. Ninos Heroes and Independencia. For information, call INT-91-14-16-60-00.
<p>
Ten minutes from the downtown sites is the stylish and very comfortable Villa Suites, the first all-suite hotel in Chihuahua.  Perfect for business travelers or families, the suites feature kitchenette with stove, dishwasher, coffee maker, as well as VCR and exercycle, while the hotel has an indoor/outdoor pool, jacuzzi, health club, spa, restaurant, ping-pong table room and basketball court.   Both prices include tax and a continental breakfast. for information, call INT-91-14-14-33-50.

<p>
<b>Excursions</b>
<p>
While in Chihuahua, visit the nearby town of Santa Eulalia, a renovated mining town with a 300-year-old working mine. Its restored log cabins and colonial houses provide numerous shopping, eating and entertainment opportunities.  
<p>
Traveling west about 70 miles out of Chihuahua, the terrain changes quickly from arid expanses that are only occasionally dotted by green (the result of irrigation projects) to the lush fields around Cuauhtemoc, Mexico's major Mennonite settlement.  In this community of about 50,000 it is most common to see fair-skinned, blond and blue-eyed locals riding their horse-drawn buggies in traditional dress and speaking their own Germa
dialect. The Mennonites produce a variety of products, including cheese and sausage, that are favorites among Mexicans.
<p>
About 100 miles west of Cuauhtemoc, near Ocampo, the Cascade de Basaseachic explodes out of a sumptuous pine forest. Some 900 feet of cascading water make this the highest falls in Mexico and the fourth highest in North America. Guided day tours that go to the falls and stop in the Mennonite communities can be arranged from Chihuahua. 
<p>
For those interested in the curative powers of thermal springs, Ojo de Jabali, Ojo Caliente and Ojo Salado are about 90 miles southeast of Chihuahua along Highway 45.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>CIUDAD JUAREZ</b></font>
<p>
On the south bank of the Rio Grande, across the Texas border from El Paso is Ciudad Juarez, the State of Chihuahua's biggest city. Originally known as Paso del Norte, one of the stops on the old Santa Fe Trail, it is still an interesting blend of Mexican and Texan, with a dash of the Old West that has never disappeared.  
<p>
The city is visited by millions of American tourists each year. Juarez (as it is also known) is a major starting point for many Mexican adventures. Bullfighting, greyhound racing and horse races are among the more popular visitor activities in Ciudad Juarez, but the city and environs offer many other tempting sites. 
<p>
The city is filled with wide boulevards and tree-filled parks with imposing statues and a Spanish mission, the Mission of Our Lady of Guadalupe, that has been active since 1659. The town that grew up around the church was called Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe del Paso del Norte. It was changed in 1888 to Cuidad Juarez in honor of Benito Juarez, the Zapotec Indian leader who became president of Mexico.  
<p>
In addition visiting the Juarez monument, visitors should stop into the Museum of Art and History, the recently opened Centro Cultural, the Cristales De Chihuahua, a working glass factory, and the Pueblito Mexico, a shopper's paradise that features products and crafts from all over Mexico, as well as works of contemporary artists.   
<p>
<b>Accommodations</b>
<p>
For those who seek luxury accommodations, the Plaza Juarez, located on Lincoln at Coyoacan, offers air-conditioned rooms and color TVs. For information, call INT-91-16-13-13-10.  
<p>

<p>
<b>Excursions</b>
<p>
The perfect introduction to any Mexican adventure lies about 120 miles southwest of Ciudad Juarez: a spectacular archaeological site with some of the most extraordinary pre-Columbian ruins in northern Mexico. Known as Casas Grandes/Nuevo Casas Grandes, the site has a number of Toltec-Aztec ball courts, platforms, pyramids and underground dwellings. The site lies along route 10, which exits off of Highway 45 at El Sueco. While mystery surrounds historical details, the area was most likely established by Indians of the North American southwest. 
<p>
A little farther south is Baricora, the former 875,000-acre estate of William Randolph Hearst. A large Mennonite settlement is located nearby, with more than 15,000 German-speaking farmers who produce oats, cheese and meats.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>HERMOSILLO</b></font>
<p>
Northwestern Mexico is dominated by the second-largest state, Sonora, a dry desert featuring cacti and wooded mountain ranges. It was there, prior to the arrival of the Spanish, that tribes such as the Papagos, Opatas, Yacqui and Mayo roamed the Sierra Occidental mountains.  
<p>
Hermosillo, capital of Sonora, is home to a beautiful neo-classic Catedral de la Asenci—n that lines the Plaza Zaragoza, a serene square best seen at sunset when hundreds of yellow-headed blackbirds flock here to rest for the night. Also worthy of a visit is Madero Park, a popular sports center that offers baseball, tennis and handball.
<p>
The Museo Regional de Historia de Sonora at the university, is a great place to view pre-Columbian artifacts and collections illustrating local Indian cultures. The museum is the resting place of a mummified body that was found in an area cave and is believed to be at least 10,000 years old. Also on the university campus is Centro Ecologico de Sonora, which takes visitors on an educational journey through the diversity of the flora and fauna of Mexico's ecosystems. The Rodriguez Dam is one of the largest earthfill dams in Mexico and has played an integral part in converting this desert region into an agricultural center.
<p>
<b>Accommodations</b>
<p>
In Hermosillo, the Kino is the nicest of the downtown hotels. Facilities include a restaurant, pool, sauna and garden.   For information, call INT-91-62-13-31-31.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>CULIACAN</b></font>
<p>
Built on an ancient Nahua Indian settlement, the capital of Sinaloa State began as a mining town, but due in large part to early use of irrigation, it became an agricultural center. It derives its name from the Nahuatl word colhuacan, or place where the god Coltzin is revered.   
<p>
Today, the region surrounding Culiacan is known for producing some of the world's juiciest and reddest tomatoes, sugar cane, cotton and winter vegetables. Located between the foothills of the Sierra Madre and the Pacific Ocean, the area is particularly attractive for those interested in fishing for perch, catfish and trout in Lakes Sanalona and Adolfo L—pez Mateos.

<center><font size=+2>Ecotourism In Mexico: Nature At Its Best</font></center><p>
<p>
Ecotourism has become a popular alternative to traditional tours in Mexico.l  With diverse terrain and an abundance of natural resources, Mexico is an ideal destination for experiencing nature first-hand.  Until recently, only traditional camping and hiking tours were available.  Now, however, integrated tours encompassing not only nature but the cultures of Mexico's many indigenous peoples, make it possible for tour participants to experience unique adventures.
<p>
Ecotourism opportunities have begun to develop in a big way in Mexico.  Beginning as a grassroots movement, the ecotourism movement now includes many small tour operators who have the support of SECTUR, Mexico's Ministry of Tourism.  The goals are simple: to provide tourism that has low impact on and respect for nature, and to teach the local people about sustainable development and alternatives to destruction as in the case of tropical rain forests.
<p>
Generally, ecotours are less expensive in Mexico than everywhere esle.  Also, the overall climate allows participants to have more days of sunshine with no snow.  In addition, ecotours allow tour participants to experience another ethnic culture as they live, integrating local traditions and festivals.  Tours are conducted with small groups of eight or ten people.  These are participatory tours.  Each includes the local foods of the regions served with explanations about how they are made.  Ecotours in Mexico are a true Mexican experience, a cultural immersion.
<p>
Ecotours make participants more aware of the local flora and fauna by having experts on hand to explain them.  The real is related to the unreal in folk art designs, as tours help promote extinct or almost extinct handicrafts.
<p>
On ecotours into the Mundo Maya, for example, participants learn about village life, Mayan language, herbal doctors, and arts and crafts.
<p>
<font size=+1>ECOGRUPOS DE MEXICO</font>
<p>
Leading the ecotourism movement is a young adventuresome group, Ecogroups de Mexico.  The company, staffed almost entirely by people in their twenties and thirties, conducts alternative tours of Mexico.
<p>
The owners of the company, are genuinely disturbed by such antics as illegal harvesting of sea turtles.  But they also worry about how workers who have depended on these turtles for a living can find another way to make money without poaching an endangered species.
<p>
It might be assumed that participants in the tours of this two-year-old firm would, like its employees, be young people -- professionals who own personal home computers and possess a heightened awareness of the environment.  In fact, just the opposite is true.
<p>
Ecologically-minded participants on a tour through the Copper Canyon or to see the flamingos at Rio Largartos in the Yucatan, range upwards from age 45.
<p>
In the past they coped with mild discomforts.  Today, they are willing to pay for reasonable comfort -- but not super deluxe hotels.  Above all they seek informed guides, even if they're part-time college students still studying biology or zoology.  Such youthful Mexican guides are more up-to-date on recent findings and studies.  Far from repeating the historically-oriented automated lectures of other tour guides, they concentrate on what's happening today.
<p>
Ecogroups tries to make every trip an enriching experience.  They have designed a concept that offers excursions to different points in the country -- whether ecologically, archaeologically, or historically based -- that are all-inclusive.  Each participant receives a log of the itinerary and information on the points to be visited.  Also, a special guest, usually a recognized authority with in-depth knowledge of the area, accompanies the group for at least part of the trip. 
<p>
Excursions range from the preserve of the Monarch butterfly to the Mayan Route, including such destinations as Rio Largartos and El Triunfo bird sanctuary in Chiapas.  For information, write Centro Comercial Plaza Inn, Ave. Insurgentes Sur 1971, loc. 251 Nivel Paseo, Col. Guadalupe Inn, C.P. 01020 Mexico D.F. or call INT-91-56-61-91-21.
<p>
<font size=+1>ECOLOGICAL REFUGES</font>
<p>
<b>Sian Ka'an</b>
<p>
In the Mayan language, Sian Ka'an means Òwhere the sky is born.Ó  This biosphere consists of 1.3 million acres of largely undisturbed tropical forest, wetlands, and marine habitats.  The highest elevation is only 60 feet above sea level, and the area's shallow bays comprise Mexico's most important spiny lobster nursery.  Scattered keys in the bays provide nesting sites for thousands of water birds including woodstorks, frigate birds and boat-billed herons.  Rare jabiru storks nest in the reserve as well, and the beaches are nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles.
<p>
Established in 1986 as part of a United Nations program, the biosphere also protects manatee, monkeys, ocelots and crocodiles.  Approximately 1,200 plant species also can be found in the reserve.  The landscape, long ago traversed by canals dug by the Maya, is a broad expanse of beaches, dunes, marshes, savannas, lagoons and large tracts of lowland tropical forests.  Sian Ka'an barrier reef forms part of the fifth longest such reef in the world.
<p>
Full-day tours available through Amigos de Sian Ka'an, a non-profit Mexican conservation out of Cancun, cost $115 per person and include lunch and a canoe trip through the canals.  For information, call 91-84-95-83 or 87-30-80.
<p>
<b>Botazoo Ecological Reserve</b>
<p>
Balancing environmental preservation with tourism is the goal of a 50,000-acre ecological reserve now under development in Huatulco. The Parque Botonico y Zoologico (Botany and Zoological Park), or Botazoo, is one of the most ambitious ecological undertakings connected with tourism development in Mexico.
<p>
Sponsored by FONATUR, Botazoo may eventually serve as a prototype for future projects which devote the majority of land acquired for tourism to the preservation of the environment.
<p>
The reserve will include two parks--Chahueand and Copalita--an ecological support center, which is the core of the project, and several small hotels.  Nearly completed, the support center will offer conference and research rooms, laboratories, electronic data links, technical supplies and staff for environmental agencies and institutions working or studying in the area.
<p>
<b>Xochimilco Ecological Park</b>
<p>
Xochimilco Ecological Park, sponsored by the University of Mexico and the federal government, is a two-year old park adjoining the famed Gardens of Xochimilco on the outskirts of Mexico City.  Over 500 acres of canals, islands and a lake make up the park, which includes a visitor's center and hiking paths.
<p>The lush landscape, home to a variety of birds, including egrets and ducks, is made up of chinapas (large cushions of earth), where vegetables and flowers are grown in the old ways of the Aztecs.  Large trees with deep roots ÒtieÓ the islands together.  The park also includes a market complex in which farmers can sell their produce and a 200-acre sports complex.  A motorized jitney train takes visitors through the park, or they can opt to take a boat through the canals.
<p>
<font size=+1>NATIONAL PARKS</font>
<p>
While most national parks in Mexico have been set aside as camping and hiking reserves, none is equipped with concessions as in the United States.  The Mexican government is preparing two of its national parks--Popocatepetl and Viscaya--to be equipped with concessions for visitors, similar to those in U.S. national parks.  Although there are no services within the parks themselves.  Several parks are near Mexico City.  Desert of the Lions National Park, 15 miles west of the city, has neither lions or cacti, but does have tall pine trees and the remains of a 17th-century Carmelite monastery.  
<p>
Cumbres de Ajusco National Park, located at an altitude of 12,800 feet just south of the city, is a 2,000-acre meadowland with dense evergreen forests on the slopes of volcanoes.  La Marquesa, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla National Park, is set in a 4,500-acre valley surrounded by mountains off the Mexico City-Toluca highway (Rte. 15).  The Valley of Silence is one of its best features.
<p>
<font size=+1>CAMPING AND HIKING</font>
<p>
Formerly campgrounds and trailer parks were primarily found in Northwestern Mexico and the Upper Baja California Peninsula.  Now there are camping facilities along nearly every major highway in Mexico, from the northern border to the Yucatan Peninsula.  Some national parks have areas set aside for camping, but these do not have electrical hookups for recreational vehicles.
<p>
Although there are many out-of-the-way places in Mexico where adventure-seekers can hike, the national parks in the central region of the country offer marked hiking trails.
<p>
Packaged camping tours are a safe and comfortable way to experience adventourous travel in Mexico.  Outfitters are becoming better equipped and guides know the areas they tour and take care of advanced planning and day-to-day organizing.
<p>
A number of companies offer tours that feature camping, hiking and biking, as well as the other outdoor activities like kayaking, scuba diving and whale watching.  There are also birdwatching tours with experienced ornithologists.
<p>
One of the most popular areas of exploration is the Copper Canyon of northwestern Mexico. Located in the Sierra Madre Mountains, it is four times larger than the Grand Canyon in the United States.  Trekking into the canyon provides access to old mining towns and unusual rock formations.
<p>
<font size=+1>Camping and Hiking Tips</font>
<p>
The mild climate and breathtaking scenery throughout Mexico can provide exciting on-foot adventures.  Whether traveling alone or with a guide or tour group, campers and hikers can sleep more comfortably under Mexico's stars with some careful planning.
<p>
Common sense is the best rule, but following are some suggestions for making the most of the trip:
<p>
Before pitching tents, plan ahead and camp only in designated campgrounds.  Never camp along the ocean, on an empty beach or in any other isolated area not designed for camping.  No permits or fees are required for camping.  Camping guidebooks are available in bookstores and sporting good stores.
<p>
Although it is best to bring camping equipment, some equipment can be purchased in Mexican sporting good stores.  When considering packaged camping tours, be sure to find out if equipment is included and what individual participants are required to bring.
<p>
Even if told that a campground provides purifies water, it is best to use bottled, self-purified or boiled water for drinking.  Buy purification tablets before leaving home.  They are a good alternative to boiling water.
<p>
When hiking, always take a map of the trail.  Never head into the wilderness before checking on safety conditions in the area.
<p>
<font size=+1>Hard Adventure Trips</font>
<p>
Trips can also be arranged to scale Mexico's three highest volcanoes -- Popocatepetl, Ixtaccihuatl and Pico de Orizaba -- or joining a Baja California muleback expedition to see ancient paintings.  Trips are rated according to physical fitness requirements.

<p>
<center><font size=+2>OAXACA STATE--AN EXOTIC WORLD AWAY </font></center>
<p>
The State of Oaxaca, with its impressive mountain ranges and secluded beaches, is one of the most scenically attractive in Mexico. As Mexico's fifth largest state, its vast geographic and ethnic diversity are unrivaled. Located southeast of Mexico City on a vast, fertile plateau some 5,000 feet above sea level, Oaxaca combines a fascinating mix of indigenous cultures, each with its own tradition and dialect. Add to this colonial grandeur, vast archaeological sites and 316 miles of relatively unexploited tropical Pacific coastline, and the result makes for a unique destination. 
<p>
Oaxaca is encircled by the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains and, together with its neighboring state of Chiapas, it contains the largest diversity of indigenous cultures and peoples in Mexico. This explains Oaxaca's richness and variety in handicrafts, folklore, culture and gastronomy. The area's native inhabitants are descendants of the Zapotec and Mixtec cultures, which were the founders of one of this hemisphere's greatest pre-Columbian civilizations. 
<p>
The region is a cultural mosaic even today. Thousands of tiny villages dot the valleys, mountainsides and coastal lowlands. Two out of every three "Oaxaquenos" is indigenous and comes from one of 17 distinct groups within the Mixtecs and Zapotecs. Over 200 dialects have survived and most of the state's three million inhabitants do not speak Spanish as a first language. 
<p>
The Mixtecs and Zapotecs left behind vivid reminders of their legacies, witnessed through the magnificent ruins at Monte Alban, Mitla and Yagul. These sites, as well as more than 4,000 other archeological sites, of which only about 800 have been excavated, bear witness to highly-developed civilizations knowledgeable in astronomy, writing and religion. 
<p>
The tribes were conquered by the Aztecs, who set up a colony where the city of Oaxaca is located, and in 1528, Cortez arrived to claim much of the area for himself and his countrymen. The Spaniards created a splendid colonial city which is still evident today.
<p>
<b>Oaxaca City</b>
<p>
Situated in the pleasant Valley of Oaxaca in the southern highlands, the city of Oaxaca, one of Mexico's Colonial treasures, enjoys an agreeable, temperate climate. Directly in the geographic center of the State, it is also the capital.
<p>
Oaxaca's narrow streets are laid out in a simple grid, making this city easily explored on foot. Secluded within the streets of Oaxaca are a great number of monuments, 16th century buildings, two fascinating museums, 27 churches and in the heart of it all, the arcade-fringed zocalo. Here, the city comes alive in what some people say is the gaiest and liveliest squares in all of Mexico. Oaxaca's zocalo, combines the sounds of marimba bands and wandering street musicians with the everyday sounds of evangelistas (public letter writers), students, tourists and families. Circled by outdoor cafes, the zocalo is both a social and cultural gathering place.
<p>
Perhaps one of Oaxaca's most impressive buildings is the Church of Santo Domingo, founded by the Dominican fathers in 1570. The interior of this Baroque church is truly a work of art. It is covered with polychrome reliefs and golden decorations, massive gold chandeliers, paved tile floors and 11 interesting chapels. The church's gold-encrusted interior is crowned by its golden Rococo high altar.
<p>
The city's cathedral, on the north side of the zocalo, took close to 180 years to complete. Its lovely century-old wooden clock, which still works today, was a gift from the King of Spain.
<p>
The Basilica de la Soledad is a massive 17th century church dedicated to Oaxaca's patron saint--the Virgen of Soledad (Virgin of Solitude)--thought to have supernatural healing powers. Inside the church is a statue of the Virgin, dressed in a black jewel-studded cape; she is dressed in different clothes for various religious occasions. Citizens and visitors come from all over to see the virgin and to offer prayers and gifts in return for her healing powers.
<p>
Both the Regional Museum of Oaxaca and the Rufino Tamayo Museum of Pre-Hispanic art are worth a visit. Attached to the Santo Domingo Church is the Regional Museum, which displays precious artifacts of gold, jade and carved bone excavated from Tomb #7 of Monte Alban. The Rufino Tamayo Museum holds some 2,000 pieces of pre-Hispanic art donated by the artist himself.
<p>
Today, Oaxaca is still the center of trade for the surrounding villages. On Saturdays, Indian women spread out blankets at the Benito Juarez Market, displaying shawls, cloth puppets, wooden combs and woven bags. Almost every imaginable article used in everyday life is sold here. Visitors can find not only great bargains, but also a wealth of handicrafts unique to the region.
<p>
Most of the arts and crafts are made in talleres (workshops) in surrounding villages and sold here. Special articles include the famous black pottery from San Bartolo Coyotepec; custom-made blankets of geometric designs woven on Spanish looms with natural fibers in dyes from nearby Teotitlan del Valle; woven belts called fajas made in Santo Tomas; huipiles--fine blouses woven from rough cotton into soft cloth and made by the Amuzgo people of Xochistlahuaca; and a variety of other jewelry, clothing, leather goods, shawl and rugs.
<p>
<b>Fiestas</b>
<p>
Oaxaca is known for its special celebrations. One of the biggest and most popular events is held in July, during the annual Lunes del Cerro (Monday of the Hill) or la Guelaguetza. This indigenous festival is dedicated to the god of rain and fertility, and features music, food, dance and magnificent costumes. Performances are held on the Cerro el Fortin, a large open-air arena on a hill at the edge of town. People of all sorts flock to the area to offer gifts and watch village troupes from neighboring regions perform their native dances. Other interesting and elaborate celebrations are held during the Days of the Dead (November 1 & 2), and the Night of the Radishes Festival, held December 23, when farmers bring large, carved radishes to town for the annual competition. 
<p>
<b>Traditional Foods</b>
<p>
One of the highlights of visiting Oaxaca is the opportunity to enjoy its traditional cuisine, one of the finest and most elaborate in all of Mexico. Oaxaca is known as the "land of seven moles" because of its seven distinct kinds of multispiced mole sauces. Only one of them is made with cocoa, rivaling that of Puebla (mole Poblano) in thickness and flavor. Among other specialties are cheeses, tamales and mescal--an alcoholic beverage made from the maguey cactus.
<p>
<b>Oaxaca City Hotels</b>
<p>
Oaxaca City offers various hotels ranging from five-star to quaint moderately-priced inns. Some hotels include the five-star El Presidente Camino Real and the Hotel Victoria and the four-star Mision de Los Angeles and San Felipe Mision. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>EXCURSIONS</b></font>
<p>
<b>Monte Alban</b>
<p>
Only nine miles from the city of Oaxaca stands the most breathtaking archaeological find. Once a sacred Zapotec city inhabited by some 40,000 people, Monte Alban covered an area of 25 square miles on a mountaintop leveled by the Zapotecs. With the exception of one building thought to have been an observatory due to its position with the stars, all the buildings are perfectly aligned from north to south.
<p>
Monte Alban is most famous for the Temple of the Dancers, the oldest of the four temples, which depicts elaborate stone figures. The figures are naked and distorted and archaeologists now speculate that the images represent wounded or sick people.
<p>
Getting there is easy. Organized tours leaving from Oaxaca city can be arranged at local travel agencies; special tourist buses leave every half hour from the Meson del Angel Hotel in Oaxaca city to all three archaeological sites here mentioned.  English speaking guides are available at the site.  
<p>
<b>Mitla</b>
<p>
The structures at this archaeological site, located 24 miles southeast of Oaxaca, are believed to have been originally built by the Zapotec population and completed by the Mixtecs. The name Mitla comes from the Aztec word meaning "the place of the dead."  The architecture resembles Greek-style geometric designs and is notably different from other ruins in the area. Unlike other ancient pre-Hispanic structures, the walls at Mitla are made of inlaid stone mosaic that are completely abstract and do not resemble humans, animals or mythological events. Adding to the site's uniqueness is the fact that Mitla continued to be inhabited even after the Spanish conquest.
<p>
<b>El Tule</b>
<p>
A stop by Oaxaca's famous Tule tree on the way to (or back from) Mitla is a must. Located four miles east of Oaxaca, this enormous ahuehete cypress tree is estimate is to be more than 2,000 years old. It stands some 140 feet high and its trunk has a diameter of 138 feet. The Tule stands guard over the town of Santa Maria el Tule and is larger than the church behind it.      
<p>
<b>Yagul</b>
<p>
Yagul rests on a hill-top some 15 miles from Oaxaca city on the way to Mitla. This small city is a fortress and is surrounded by a group of palaces and temples. This site includes a ball court and more than 300 uncovered underground tombs.
<p>
<b>Getting There</b>
<p>
Oaxaca's airport is located five miles south of downtown. Taxis are available for the ride from the airport to town. Aeromexico and Mexicana airlines offer direct service from Mexico City. Trains from Mexico City to Oaxaca arrive at the station in Calzada Madero. Oaxaca's bus terminal (located 20 minutes on foot from the Zocalo) offers frequent motorcoach service to Mexico City, Puebla, Veracruz, San Cristobal de las Casas and most other cities in Mexico.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>THE COAST OF OAXACA</b></font>
<p>
The Oaxacan coast has long been overlooked by tourists seeking palm-lined bays and seaside seclusion. Until recently, the beaches of Oaxaca--300 miles of lush tropical Pacific coastline--have been relatively unknown except for the long-established small fishing town of Puerto Escondido and Puerto Angel. But now the newly-created Huatulco, 75 miles west of Puerto Escondido, is fast becoming a world-class resort.
<p>
<b>The Bays of Huatulco</b>
<p>
Set on the Pacific coast of Oaxaca state, the Bays of Huatulco lie 70 miles south of Puerto Escondido and encompass 22 miles of pristine unspoiled beaches, fascinating coves, and royal blue bays teaming with fish. Huatulco was originally a Zapotec and Mixtec fishing village. When the Spanish conquerors arrived, Huatulco became the most important port on the Pacific, due to its strategic location.
<p>
The Bays of Huatulco is FONATUR's newest resort development, considered one of the most ambitious long-term tourism projects undertaken by the Mexican Government. It will have 30,000 hotel rooms by 2020, welcoming approximately 2 million tourists a year. Huatulco offers unsurpassed tranquil beauty with beach after beach framed by white sand and the jagged peaks of the Sierra Madre del Sur Mountains creating a stunning contrast to the crystal blue waters. The Mexican Government intends to protect Huatulco's natural beauty. All of Huatulco's megaprojects are designed to allocate more than two-thirds of their areas to ecological reserves. With its ambitious and conscientious growth plans, the Bays of Huatulco may become a prototype for future tourism projects.
<p>
At present, Huatulco has 15 hotels with a total of 1,752 rooms including the five-star Sheraton Huatulco, Casa de Mar, Crowne Plaza Resort, Omni Zaashila and Royal Maeva hotels; the four-star Posada Binninguenda Hotel; and the Club Med--the largest Club Med in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
There are nine bays to be developed in Huatulco.  Tangolunda, the most developed of the bays, is home to an 18-hole golf course, five beaches and six modern hotels, including Club Med. Chahue, Huatulco's next largest bay, is where many new developments are underway, including "Puerto Chahue," a new 136-slip marina with nautical and residential areas and a 452-room hotel. The town of Crucecita, population 7,000, is located about one mile inland from Chahue bay. There, visitors will find a charming main square and a quaint community market. 
<p>
The relocated village of Santa Cruz has a flourishing central square complete with restaurants, shops and a public marina where visitors can depart on a boat excursions of the  bays.
<p>
Another megaproject currently in development is "Bahia de Cacaluta," a complete resort with a marina and golf course covering 1,100 acres. The bay will be home to 2,500 hotel and condominium rooms, an 18-hole golf course and a 200-slip marina.  
<p>
Huatulco's airport is located 12 miles north of Santa Cruz.   Aeromexico and Mexicana fly to Huatulco from Mexico City and Aeromorelos offers service from Oaxaca.
<p>
<b>Puerto Escondido</b>
<p>
This seaside town of 45,000 people is one of the most beautiful hideaways of southern Mexico and long favored by surfing enthusiasts. Nearly 95 percent of Puerto Escondido's inhabitants are from indigenous descent and the majority work in farming or fishing. The town retains its laid back atmosphere and is perfect for tourists seeking relaxation and a break from the dazzle and sophistication of Acapulco or Cancun. 
<p>
Puerto Escondido, about 80 miles north of Huatulco, is secluded but not unreachable and only a quick plane ride from Oaxaca or Mexico City. While there, relax at the Playa Principal or main beach set around a calm bay of clear water. Puerto Angelito and Puerto Manzanilla just west of town are quiet, secluded coves great for snorkeling.  Nearby Playa Bacocho is an isolated, elongated beach with sparkling white sand and rough seas.
<p>
Accommodations in Puerto Escondido are affordable and comfortable and include the four-star Fiesta Mexicana Hotel, Posada Real Hotel (Best Western) and the Santa Fe Hotel, and the three-star Las Palmas Hotel.
<p>
<b>Puerto Angel</b>
<p>
Located approximately 50 miles to the south of Puerto Escondido, Puerto Angel is a little more rustic but definitely worth a visit. The scenery is breathtaking and the menu of the day centers around fresh-caught fish. There are several beaches including the Playa del Panteon (Cemetery Beach), which has a small graveyard with brightly colored tombstones. Accommodations here are rustic and affordable, including the small, inn-type Angel del Mar Hotel and Posada Devata.

<center><font size=+2>ALL-INCLUSIVE RESORTS TAKING HOLD IN MEXICO</font></center>
<p>
All-inclusive resorts have hit the beaches in Mexico. They advertise one price for everything--bed, food, drink, entertainment. Beginning in Puerto Vallarta and Cancun, they have now spread well beyond.
<p>
Aside from Club Med, which opened the first of its five Mexico properties in 1974, all-inclusives here have taken over one-fifth of the market in the past four years. And more are opening all the time. 
<p>
In the Cancun area, Club Robinson, the European all-inclusive, has opened Club Robinson Tulum. And it plans to build two more. The Melia Mayan and El Cozumeleno have recently opened.
<p>
In Ixtapa and Los Cabos, the former Intercontinental Presidente Hotels have become the all-inclusive Presidente Forum Resorts.
<p>
Allegro All-Inclusive, formed when Caribbean Village Clubs and Resorts and Diamond Hotels and Resorts merged, has opened six new all-inclusives in the past two years and is planning two more. These include its top-of-the-line Diamond Resorts, the activity focused Caribbean Villages and the economical ValuClubs.
<p>
Tour operators are pairing the room rate with airfare and selling them at astonishingly low prices, driving people out of their houses and on vacations rather than to buy a new refrigerator. One operator said that if there is a choice between a new rug for the foyer and a stay at a Mexican all-inclusive, people will walk on wood after they return from sipping margaritas on the beach.
<p>
All-inclusives have been increasing every year. Those such as Diamond Village, the Beach Palace, and the Sun Palace in Cancun are so popular that reservations are in high demand.  The Royal Solaris and Club Las Velas, also in Cancun, and Jack Tar Village in Puerto Vallarta and Sierra Radison Cancun, are some of the most popular.
<p>
All-inclusives are especially attractive to families with kids--one price, no surprises, leave your wallet at home. Many also include day care and other activities. These resorts allow people to enjoy the vacation time they have to a higher degree. It's not just the portal-to-portal price, but security as well.
 <p>
No one can take the name all-inclusive at face value. In Mexico, all-inclusive generally means all meals, most land-based activities that are on-site, and alcoholic drinks at meals and sometimes between. Most charge for imported liquor and some charge for wine with meals. Likewise some charge for watersports, others include everything as long as it is part of a scheduled activity.  All-inclusives are more popular for three- or four-night vacations than they are for seven. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Selected All-Inclusive Resorts</b></font>
<p>
The Diamond Resort Playacar, for example, located in Playa del Carmen 30 miles south of Cancun, offers a village atmosphere with shaded pathways leading throughout the entire complex. Its main restaurant serves buffets for all three meals and two specialty restaurants offer a la carte Mexican and Italian cuisine. The all-inclusive price includes unlimited alcohol, soft drinks and juices, a cocktail party, entertainment, a kids activity program, watersports for scheduled activities (others extra), clinics for all sports, and babysitting for a fee. Two more Diamond Resort Hotels can be found in Nuevo Vallarta and on the island of Cozumel. 
<p>
Diamond Resort's sister property, the Caribbean Village Playacar, located next door in Playa del Carmen, offers bungalows built around a shared championship golf course. This off-the-beach resort offers a shuttle to the Diamond's beach. While everything is nearly the same as the more luxurious Diamond Resort, wine is served with dinner and alcoholic beverages are limited to national brands. A more family-oriented place, kids under six stay free and a kids program is offered for those six to twelve.
<p>
The third part of the Allegro trio is its ValuClub in Puerto Vallarta. This 250-room resort caters mainly to budget-minded travelers. Though it, too, isn't on a beach, the nearest one is just a stroll away.
<p>
One of the newest conversions is the 100-room El Cozumeleno Hotel on Cozumel. This Bounty all-inclusive resort offers a program for the value-minded guest modeled after other Bounty properties. Unlike the Allegro hotels, it offers a buffet breakfast, sit-down lunch and dinner, hors d'oeuvres, barbecues, snacks, unlimited alcohol (house wine, domestic beer and cocktails), and a supervised Camp Bounty for kids, as well as sightseeing tours, entertainment, roundtrip transfers, taxes, tips, and baggage handling.
<p>
One of the best family all-inclusives is the 400-room Presidente Forum Resort Ixtapa. More than 70 percent of its rooms are adjoining. Unlike some of the other all-inclusives, packages to this resort can differ according to price. Some include taxes and gratuities, while others do not. Two of the unusual amenities here are the free dance and Mexican cooking lessons. There's also a children's camp, the Chiqui Club. Most watersports equipment is included, but wave runner and banana boat rentals, parasailing, sightseeing and scuba gear are not.
<p>
The El Dorado Resort, set along a pristine one and a half mile beach along the Tulum coast one hour south of Cancun, is a totally Mexican operation. Unlike many of the other all-inclusives, it offers true Mexican hospitality and some unusual perks. For instance, all rooms are one-bedroom suites with ocean views from porches or balconies, and come equipped with full baths, ceiling fans and hammocks. Guests receive in-room champagne upon check-in and its restaurant offers a la carte gourmet meals, as well as made-to-order meals. Lobster is served twice weekly, and there is room service. Unlike the others, all meals are served, no buffets are offered. Guests feel pampered here, offering an opportunity for stress reduction.
<p>

<center><font size=+2>DRIVING IN MEXICO</font></center>
<p>
Driving is the best way to explore out-of-the-way places in Mexico. The privacy, comfort and convenience of touring by car cannot be matched by any other form of transport. Mexico's highways and roads are renowned for their spectacular scenery. Sudden, unexpected glimpses of tropical flowers, desert plants, mountains and aquamarine waters form a backdrop to the road.
<p>
Today, it is easy to drive in Mexico. A massive $5 billion highway improvement program is underway as Mexico has added more than 10,000 kilometers of new highways and plans to construct thousands of kilometers more.
<p>
 The new autopistas (toll roads) now connect the country's beautiful colonial cities with Mexico's luxurious beach resorts.  Two new superhighways connecting Acapulco to Mexico City and Merida to Cancun whisk travelers to their final destination in less than half the time. 
<p>
Road warriors will also soon be able to head southeast into the country as highways connecting Mexico City to both Oaxaca and Veracruz and Veracruz to Villahermosa are currently under construction. A 1,600 kilometer superhighway now links Nogales at the Arizona border to Mazatlan, Laredo with Monterrey and El Paso with Chihuahua.  
<p>
The goal of this effort, a collaboration between Mexico's Ministry of Tourism (SECTUR), the Ministry of Communication and Transportation (SCT) and the Ministry of Finance(Hacienda), is to facilitate access to Mexico's wonderful destinations for those who prefer to go the scenic route, by car or motorcoach. 
<p>
 Besides the services of the Mexico's Green Angels, who assist tourists in need of mechanical repair, gasoline or simply directions on how to get to a desired destination, a convenient 24-hour toll-free number is available for tourists seeking advice or information while traveling in Mexico. The number, 91 800 90329 (In Mexico City the number is 250-0123 or 250-0151), connects callers with English-speaking operators ready to provide tourists with helpful information.
<p>
On the road, drivers will find plenty of opportunities to purchase fuel or refreshments. Over 2,000 Pemex gasoline stations now offer unleaded fuel, and modern rest stops now line many of the country's newer highways.
<p>
With Mexico's commitment to safe, modern road travel, the country anticipates an increase in ground tourism between Mexico and the United States. Travelers utilizing Mexico's toll roads will now save significant travel time, which translates into more sightseeing and fun.
<p>
For more information on road conditions, trip itineraries, as well as general highway information, please contact the Mexican Government Tourism Office, Surface Tourism Division in Houston, Texas at (713) 880-8772.
<p>
<font size=+1>TIPS FOR ENTERING MEXICO BY CAR</font>
<p>
Mexico's roads and highways can open up new vistas of a fascinating culture. But drivers to Mexico may be delayed if the simple, but easily forgotten, entry requirements are not met.  Make the trip a relaxed and easy one from the beginning, with the following helpful tips:
<p>
Bring proof of U.S. citizenship such as a birth certificate, passport or notarized affidavit of citizenship to obtain a tourist card.
<p>
Provide proof of U.S. vehicle ownership such as car title or registration to obtain a vehicle permit. Photocopies are not sufficient. Originals or official state-issued duplicate originals are needed. 
<p>
An international credit card such as Visa, Mastercard, DinerÕs Club or American Express, in the name of the car owner, along with a valid driver's license, must be presented to obtain the necessary papers. A $12 fee will be charged on the card.    
<p>
There are other options such as posting a bond guaranteeing that the car will depart Mexico, but the credit card and fee is the most convenient method.  More information on bonding alternatives is available at the border.
<p>
If the car is leased or financed, the driver must bring a notarized letter from the bank or finance company giving the driver permission to take the car into Mexico.
<p>
U.S. auto insurance is not valid in Mexico.  A Mexican insurance company at the border or a company such as Sanborn's Mexico Insurance Service or AAA, which can write a Mexican policy must prepare the insurance coverage.
<p>
One person can take two vehicles, such as a car and a motorhome, through immigration, but a separate permit and charge is required for each vehicle.
<p>
People 18 years old and younger traveling to Mexico without their parents must present a notarized affidavit stating parental consent to enter Mexico.
<p>
People 18 years old and under not accompanied by both parents must present a notarized affidavit from the absent parent stating parental consent to enter Mexico.
<p>
Handguns are illegal in Mexico. Travelers need permits from outfitters in Mexico to bring rifles and shotguns into Mexico.
<p>
AAA offices in border states of Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California are authorized to assist in preparation of all materials necessary to enter Mexico by car.

<center><font size=+2>PUERTO VALLARTA AND THE GOLDEN COAST --
FROM SLEEPY VILLAGES TO WORLD-CLASS RESORTS</font></center>
<p>
No resort better exemplifies the palm-fringed beaches, thick jungle, and posh resort hotels of the Mexican Riviera better than Puerto Vallarta. From its sleepy seaside village roots, it has grown into one of Mexico's slickest and most loved destinations.  And like many of Mexico's other beach resorts, much is happening as Puerto Vallarta expands to meet the needs of the next century.
<p>
Growth was slow until the 1960s. Today, Puerto Vallarta is a bustling resort of 180,000 residents that attracts more than 1.5 million visitors a year. This most quality-oriented of Mexican resorts now offers more than 14,000 hotel rooms in 70 hotels, from exclusive hideaways to luxury hotels to bargain, beachfront inns.	
<p>
Most of the newer hotels have sprouted to the north and south of town. One of the most recent developments is Nuevo Vallarta, north of the airport. Radisson Hotels International recently opened the second of two new all-inclusive resorts in the area. By the end of the decade, plans call for 5,500 rooms that are expected to attract 73,000 foreign tourists annually.
<p>
Whether enjoying the privacy of a hidden cove or participating in round-the-clock activities, there's no better place than Puerto Vallarta to enjoy a "classic" Mexican seaside vacation.  
<p>
Nestled on the azure shores of Bahia de Banderas (Mexico's largest natural bay) against an awe-inspiring mountain range, Puerto Vallarta is situated on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the northwest corner of the State of Jalisco. Its history can be traced back to the 1500s, when it was visited by Spanish explorers. But it was not until 1851 that the area was first inhabited. By 1918 (the year it was officially named a municipality) the village was a sleepy farming community of 1,500 residents. It was also a port for silver shipments from central Mexico mines.
<p>
Puerto Vallarta retained its peaceful pace for 50 years, until famed Hollywood director John Houston arrived with movie stars Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in 1964 to film Tennessee William's "Night of the Iguana." The amorous affair of Burton and Taylor made worldwide headlines and the film transformed the sleepy town into a magnet for international visitors. Tourism growth was stimulated dramatically. 
<p>
Despite Puerto Vallarta's popularity and the dynamic growth of new resort developments, the city itself retains much of its fishing village charm. Cobblestone streets wind past the white stucco buildings with red tile roofs and wrought iron balconies overflowing with colorful bougainvillea vines.  ThereÕs a hint of "Old Mexico" at every turn.  
<p>
Puerto Vallarta visitors can opt for lodging in the heart of the action or tucked away in a remote tropical villa. Accommodations are available in five distinct "zones" each with its own advantages and character. The first is Nuevo Vallarta, an enclave of resorts and condos situated north of the airport.
<p>
Centerpiece of this area is the Radisson Paraiso Hotel, Puerto Vallarta's first all-inclusive resort. Its 300 rooms on seven floors in three buildings set in a U-shape surround a landscaped pool area with two restaurants. Rates include all meals, snacks, cocktails, beer, and wine, as well as all sports activities. Its sister hotel, the luxurious and all-inclusive Radisson Sierra Plaza Hotel, offers 350 rooms in a large six-story X-like structure overlooking a magnificent beach and surrounding a large pool area. Guests also have the use of a state-of-the art health center with whirlpool, sauna, and steam room, as well as tennis courts. By the end of the decade, plans call for 5,500 rooms in Nuevo Vallarta that are expected to attract 73,000 foreign tourists annually.
<p>
Second is one of the most ambitious tourism developments in Mexico, Marina Vallarta, an exclusive mega-project development set on a flat 450-acre site on the north side of town near the international airport. Described as the largest privately-financed tourism development in Mexico, this project, to be completed by the year 2000, will have attracted over $1 billion in investments. Its hotels have increased the number of rooms in Puerto Vallarta by 80 percent.
<p>
This development has over one mile of lagoon beachfront, a full-service marina with slips for 300 boats, and an 18-hole, par 71 championship golf course designed by Joe Finger. It also boasts tennis and beach clubs, a spa, restaurants, bars and a shopping center. There are also private homes, villas, condominiums and time-share units. 
<p>
Between the marina and downtown is the hotel zone, which offers numerous luxury hotels with excellent restaurants, lively clubs and top-notch sports facilities. El Pueblo, the charming colonial downtown area is yet another lodging zone which offers three-and-four star hotels, as well as accommodations for the budget-minded and lots of shopping dining and nightlife. 
<p>
The fifth zone is the lush and secluded region south of town, for those seeking a true "getaway" at one of the area's deluxe hotels nestled along pristine and private beaches.
Hotels are expanding here, also. The La Jolla Mismaloya Resort and Spa, located on the hillside cliff overlooking the ruins of the set of "Night of the Iguana," was originally built to house the crew of the film. In 1987, a major expansion added another building on the cliff and a large U-shaped complex on the beach. Now made up of five ten-story highrises, the resort dominates what used to be a quiet and secluded cove.
<p>
<b>Activities</b>
<p>
Limitless year-round sunshine, coupled with 25 miles of silky soft beaches surrounded by tropical mountains make Puerto Vallarta a paradise for those who prefer their vacations active.  Every imaginable watersport is available along Playa de los Muertos (Dead Man's Beach), named during its pirate days. Now it is called Playa del Sol (Beach of the Sun).  
<p>
Swimming, golf, tennis, sailing, fishing and horseback riding are among the most popular sports, and those who like to stand on the sideline as spectators can watch local donkey polo, a game they will never see at home. 
<p>
Considered one of the best tennis destinations in Mexico, visitors will find dozens of tennis courts at area resorts, as well as Puerto Vallarta's several fine tennis centers: The John Newcombe Tennis Center at the Plaza Vallarta Hotel; Los Tules Tennis Center; The Vallarta Tennis Center and Racquet Vallarta.
<p>
November through May is the best time for sailfish and marlin fishing. Smaller game such as wahoo, yellowtail and roosterfish are caught year-round. Fishing boats can also be chartered at the marina.
<p>
For those who wish more sedate pleasures a walk around Cuale River Island may be just the answer. This five-acre island is filled with boutiques, restaurants, a children's park, a small botanical garden and an archaeological museum. Just outside Le Bistro Restaurant at one end of the island is a statue of the late film director, John Houston.
<p>
Located in the center of town, the Church of Guadalupe is Puerto Vallarta's most visible and endearing landmark. It was built over a 33-year period, from 1918 to 1951. The steeple of this church--which serves as the city's signature--is an enormous replica of the crown worn by Carlota, empress of Mexico in the 1860s. The church exterior is decorated with angels holding hands.
<p>
Puerto Vallarta's malecon (waterfront promenade) offers a wonderful walking tour of the city, and on Sundays, local families and travelers alike stroll hand-in-hand. By day, visitors can relax in the many cafes overlooking the sea and several interesting sculptures, including Puerto Vallarta's famed giant bronze seahorse. Often, there are public art exhibits set up along the walkway. Many fine restaurants can be found along and near the malecon, as well as in resort hotels specializing in fresh seafood. By night, the area teems with nightclubs and discos, providing entertainment until the wee hours for late-night revelers.
<p>
Three-hour tours leave from most hotels each morning and afternoon. These include stops at the church, Cuale River Island and Mismaloya Beach.
<p>
<b>Shopping</b>
<p>
Puerto Vallarta's shopping is some of Mexico's finest, thanks to a raft of Mexican and international artists that make the resort their home. Visitors will find a wide selection of  shops offering everything from fine art and exquisite folk art to furniture, designer clothing and jewelry. Many of the area's artists can be seen working in studios and workshops throughout the city.   
<p>
 Hours of purchasing pleasure can be found at the following areas: The Cuale River Island, along the malecon, the outdoor flea market at the Marina, downtown along Juarez and Morelos streets, from the beach vendors, at the numerous "American style" shopping malls and the Municipal Mercado along the banks of the Cuale River. Most shops are open from 10 a.m. until 9 p.m., closing from 2 p.m.- 4 p.m.
<p>
<b>Excursions</b>
<p>
Areas on the outskirts of Puerto Vallarta offer much to see and do, particularly for those willing to venture away from the city's alluring beaches.
<p>
Banderas Bay is home to some of Mexico's prettiest coves and inlets. Most can only be reached by boat, which depart from the marina north of town. Catamarans and excursion boats to Yelapa leave daily and head south along the coast to this palm-lined village which has several beachfront restaurants serving fresh seafood and cold beer. A 150-foot waterfall surrounded by jungle can be reached by a twenty-minute walk inland.
<p>
Piedras Blancas and Playa Las Animas can also be reached by boat where fishing, lunch, sunbathing and snorkeling provide a full day of activity.
<p>
Some visitors prefer to go horseback riding into the jungle.
This four-hour escorted trail ride includes picturesque rural villages, spectacular scenery and local wildlife. A stop is made for lunch and swimming. Rancho El Charro provides the horses and guides. They offer another tour inland to San Sebastian, a historic silver town founded in 1604. .
<p>
Still another alternative is a trip to Boca de Tomatlan,  east of Playa Mismaloya. This small village at the mouth of a jungle river has large palapa restaurants and delightful freshwater pools for wading.
<p>
For a look at the dramatic jungles, deep valleys and mountain waterfalls, visitors can rent a jeep and head for Chico's Paradise, El Eden or Chino's Paradise. Here, under  thatched palapas huts next to cool mountain streams, they can talk to a parrot or take a dip in cool clear natural pools between courses of mouthwatering seafood.
<p>
<b>Getting There</b>
<p>
The Gustavo Diaz Ordaz International Airport is located four miles north of downtown. There are frequent taxi/van transfers from the airport at reasonable rates. Connecting flights through Mexico City and Guadalajara are available from most of the United States and Canada. Typical of most Mexican airports, the newly remodeled terminal has polished marble floors, plenty of souvenir shopping, a bank, an ice cream parlor and a restaurant/bar.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>THE GOLDEN COAST</b></font>
<p>
<b>Manzanillo </b>
<p>
A popular weekend destination for Guadalajara residents, Manzanillo is not your typical seaside resort town. Surrounded by luxuriant jungle, tropical fruit plantations and deserted beaches, Manzanillo offers visitors sophisticated comfort in a setting of breathtaking natural beauty. Located on Mexico's famed "Golden Coast," between Ixtapa and Puerto Vallarta, it isn't a monolithic resort complex but a number of hotels strung along and beyond the Bay of Manzanillo. Although Manzanillo has not yet developed into a major, busy resort, it has long been a hideaway for the rich and famous who swarm to the luxurious Las Hadas Beach Resort. 
<p>
Perhaps one of Mexico's most opulent resorts, Las Hadas gained fame when the movie "10" was filmed there on location.  The resort was built in the 1970's and has a Mediterranean village atmosphere with its spires, villas, domes and arches all surrounded by fine white sand beaches, lovely manicured gardens and a championship 18-hole golf course.
<p>
Just a few miles from the fantasy and magnificence of Las Hadas is the port of Manzanillo. Due to the city's fine natural harbor and rail connections to the interior of the country, Manzanillo is Mexico's door to trade with the Orient, handling enormous shipments of industrial and agricultural output. 
<p>
The Spaniards used Manzanillo port as a departure point for further Spanish conquest of other territories. In 1564 the expedition that lead to the Spanish rule over the Philippines set sail from Manzanillo. The discovery of Baja California was thanks to another expedition originated from the port of Manzanillo. 
<p>
Spots of special interest in and around Manzanillo include Playa de Oro, a secluded beach about 20 minutes away which offers excellent surfing waters; Playa Miramar and Audiencia are two other beaches in the area. Playa El Tesoro is popular with surfers, and for travelers on budgets, nearby Playa Las Brisas and Playa Azul offer long stretches of white beach and moderately-priced hotels. Horseback riding along Manzanillo beaches is especially popular.
<p>
From Manzanillo, the main attraction to visit is Colima, the state capital. A two-hour drive to the northeast, a visit can easily be made in a day. A colonial city founded in 1523 on an Indian site, it is an attractive, slow-paced town of 90,000 people, featuring simple architecture and lush gardens. 
<p>
Considered one of the best deep sea fishing spots in the world, the waters of Manzanillo are teeming with sailfish (November and December), snapper, sea bass, dolphin and yellowtail (November through March). Windsurfing, sailing, diving and waterskiing are also popular.
<p>
All the major hotels have tennis facilities. For golf, the La Mantarraya course is renowned as one of the most scenic and challenging courses in the world. For the adventurous, deer and jaguar can be stalked in the jungle further inland.
<p>
Nightlife and shopping in Manzanillo is limited. Most centers around the hotels and a few restaurants. Mexican fiesta nights are staged at several of the largest hotels. Shopping is concentrated in several small plazas and typical souvenirs can be bargained for at the municipal market downtown on Avenida Cinco de Mayo.
 <p>
<b>Costa Careyes </b>
<p>
The scenic road along highway 200 between Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta passes through tropical forests and fruit plantations, desolate beaches, quiet fishing villages, scattered lagoons and lovely foothills. Costa Careyes (Turtle Coast) alone offers eight miles of pristine coastline, perfect for swimming and sunning, snorkeling, sailing, and deep sea fishing. A beautiful view and spectacular sunset highlight the evenings. 
<p>
Other points to visit along the Golden Coast are Barra de Navidad and San Patricio de Melaque, two villages that rest on a sand bar between the open sea and Laguna de Navidad. Between them lies a curved bay of lovely beaches lined with thatched hut restaurants and a dozen or so small and inexpensive hotels.

<p><center><b>INTER-CONTINENTAL HOTELS AND RESORTS AND UNICEF COMMEMORATE 
JOINT 50TH ANNIVERSARY WITH ESTABLISHMENT OF GLOBAL 
FUNDRAISING PROGRAM</center> 

<p><i>Round Up for Children</i>  Enables International Travelers to Participate in Drive to Raise 
$1 Million for Children in Need

<p>MIAMI (February 12, 1996)</b> -- To commemorate the joint 50th anniversaries of Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts and UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) in 1996, the Round Up for Children campaign has been put in place in 170 Inter-Continental hotels in 67 countries around the globe.  The program, in which hotel guests have the option of "rounding up" their hotel bills, is expected to raise in excess of $1 million.

<p>"Inter-Continental was founded in 1946 to serve the changing needs of the post-war world in terms of business and commerce.  At the same time UNICEF was founded to meet the emergency needs of children in post-war Europe and China.  It is most fitting that we commemorate our 50 years of service together to further the extraordinary life-saving work that guides UNICEF," said J.T. Kuhlman, president, Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts, Americas.

<p>Funds raised in the year-long Round Up for Children campaign will directly support UNICEF efforts to give hope and save lives.  For example:

<ul>
<li>$10 can provide vitamin A capsules to protect 160 children from blindness caused by poor nutrition.
<li>$17 can immunize a child against the six main childhood killer diseases.
<li>$20 can provide clean water and sanitation for a child for one year.
</ul>
	
<p>Guests staying at Inter-Continental hotels will receive information about Round Up for Children upon check-in and via an in-room video.  Upon departure, donations may be applied to the credit card of the guest's choice.  

<p>In addition to Round Up for Children, Inter-Continental's core fundraising endeavor on behalf of UNICEF, hotels from around the world will participate with their own local programs in the yearlong program to support UNICEF's goals.  "This has truly become a grassroots effort, hotels from New York to Nairobi are planning charity events and staff competitions in order to contribute to UNICEF's life-saving work.  Our employees have wholeheartedly embraced the spirit of our 50th anniversary mission," said Fred G. Peelen, executive vice president, Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts, North America and chairman of Inter-Continental's 50th anniversary committee.

<center>###</center>

<p><font size=3><b>Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts</b>

<br>1996 marks the 50th anniversary for Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts and the start of a yearlong, global celebration to recognize this golden milestone.  The company was founded in 1946 under the aegis of Pan American Airways and its visionary founder Juan Trippe -- who foresaw the jet age and the revolutionary changes it would bring to global travel, and, new travelers who would demand international standards in accommodations.  Inter-Continental originated the concept of the Owners Management Agreement with its first hotel, the 85-room Grande in Belem, Brazil.  

<p>Today, owned by the Saison Group of Japan, the company's portfolio includes 170 hotels in 67 countries in its first-class Inter-Continental and mid-market Forum brands and under the Global Partner Hotels & Resorts division.  Inter-Continental will continue to blaze new trails in the next century, seeking new construction projects, management contracts and partnerships and in encouraging travel to emerging markets such as Albania, South Africa and Cambodia. Global hospitality in the 21st century is certain to demand new services, technology and support.  With 50 years of innovation and expertise, Inter-Continental will be there to serve international travelers, well into the millennium.

<center><font size=+2>MATCHING FUNDS PROGRAM HELPS PROMOTE
MEXICO'S INDIVIDUAL DESTINATIONS</font></center>
<p>
One of the most successful government programs, Fondos Mixtos or matching funds--a cooperative effort between Mexico's Ministry of Tourism (SECTUR), government officials, and private investors--has helped to promote individual Mexico destinations and regions of the country in new ways. By pooling resources this program has enabled destinations to promote themselves far beyond what could be done on the federal level.
<p>
While SECTUR's international marketing campaign creates general awareness, it can't begin to promote the many attractions in individual destinations.
<p>
Each destination has its own particular cultural, historical, and ecological attractions to offer, and the Fondos Mixtos programs help to promote the diversity of each area. Each area is free to handle their promotion as they see fit, paying particular attention to the characteristics of their tourism product and their needs at the time.
<p>
A good example is the case of Los Cabos, which has traditionally been a fishing destination. With the opening of several new world-class golf courses and the potential to become Mexico's top golf destination, there has been a shift in emphasis in advertising. With their own source of funds, the hotel owners and local government officials are free to promote this. A further example was their decision to promote their destination--comprised of Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo--as Los Cabos. Without autonomy in advertising, they would not have been able to do this.
<p>
Ixtapa had a similar identity problem with its sister destination of Zihuatanejo. A new campaign of two-destinations in one--Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo, new and modern next to charming and quaint--helped solidify it in the competitive global marketplace.
<p>
Cancun also has seen a shift from mostly singles and couples to families. Its funds have allowed it to pursue family vacation promotions, as well as more extensive promotion of the Cancun-Tulum Corridor.
<p>
One-third of the funds for this innovative advertising program come from private suppliers, another third comes from state and local governments, and the rest is contributed by SECTUR.
<p>
Begun in early 1991 with the major beach destinations of Cancun, Ixtapa, and Cabo San Lucas, the program has grown to 22  including the destinations of:  Acapulco, Cancun, Cozumel, Ensenada, Guadalajara, Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo, La Paz, Los Cabos, Manzanillo, Mazatlan, Mexico City, Nuevo Leon, Puerto Vallarta, Rosarito and Tijuana; and the regions of Colonial cities, Copper Canyon/Sea of Cortes, and the Mayan World.  Due to the increasing success of the original cities included in the project, more locations have been added such as Oaxaca, Puerto Escondido and Huatulco.  
<p>
For more information and a list of individual Fundos Mixtos  representatives, contact a regional Mexican Government Tourism Office.

<center><font size=+2>MEXICO OFFERS SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR 
EVERY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY</font></center>
<p>
Today families cannot forget about having to shop and cook or having to carpool the kids all over the place. And what about those families with kids too little to go anywhere and who must be watched every minute. Wouldn't it be better to take everyone someplace where the whole family can have fun and not get on each others nerves. Now there's a place--Mexico.
<p>
Up until a few years ago, Mexico attracted mostly adults looking for fun in the sun and a different type of cultural experience. With the opening of special children's attractions and resorts with special children's programs, the adults who came to Mexico before are now taking their kids along.
<p>
Mexico is a great destination for family vacationers, offering a variety of travel experiences through activities that are both educational and fun for people of all ages. Besides the warm climate, beautiful beaches and cultural activities that can be enjoyed by everyone, children and their parents or grandparents can explore children's museums, zoos, theme parks, underwater caves, archaeological sites, or even swim with the dolphins.  
<p>
Here is a sampling of activities awaiting family travelers in the country's four most-visited cities -- Mexico City, Cancun, Acapulco and Guadajara.
<p>
<b><font size=+1>MEXICO CITY</font></b>
<p>
El Papalote Museo del Ni–o - Mexico City's new children's museum complements what children learn in school and provides them with the opportunity to examine and question their world.  Designed by Mexican architect Ricardo Legoretta, El Papalote entices children, 14 years and under, into a world of learning through play, with 280 exhibits to choose from. EL Papalote, which means "butterfly" in the Indian language of Nathuatl, offers five themed sections: Our World; Human Body; Con-science (which combines conscience and science); Communication, from language to computers; and Expression, which includes art, music, theater and literature. 
<p>
The museum features a five-story maze and a musical staircase designed by the designer who created the tap-dance piano in the movie "Big."  This is one of the more popular exhibits, as is the hot-air balloon that rises two stories. Also a favorite is the building-sized energy machine. In addition, children can ride wheelchairs through an obstacle course to learn some of the transportation challenges facing motion-impaired persons, or find their way through a maze of black tunnels to learn about being blind.
<p>
At El Papalote, children also can climb inside a simulated 40-foot-tall rainforest tree, crawl through a 5-story maze of giant green tiles or set off laser images.  There are also temporary exhibits, workshops, an IMAX theater, store and restaurant.
<p>
 The museum, a $15-million joint project between the Mexican Government and the private sector, is already considered one of the largest and most technologically-sophisticated touch-and-do museums in the world. It has been hailed as a prototype for contemporary children's museums. Admission is about $5 for adults and about $4 for children. The museum is open Monday-Friday from 9 a.m.-6 p.m. and on Saturday from 2 p.m.-6 p.m. For information, call INT-52-5-237-1735.  
<p>
Chapultepec Park ZooAfter a $30 million renovation, the Chapultepec Zoo has reopened. Its main attractions are still its five pandas (the zoo was the first to successfully breed them in captivity), two Mexico wolves (only 30 remain in the world) and a white tiger.
<p>
The project enlarged the living space for most animals and made the zoo easier to walk through for visitors. A new aviary has also been constructed. The children's zoo has a miniature railroad for viewing the animals, picnic grounds, and a boating lake. Kids can play with the animals, ride ponies and climb tree houses. Admission to the zoo is free. Hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily.
<p>
<b>Chapultepec Magico</b><br>
Near the zoo is a children's attraction park with various games and rides, including a roller coaster called Monta–a Rusa (Russian Mountain). For a nominal admission charge, kids and their parents can take advantage of 30 rides and games. The park, set by a man-made lake, also has a restaurant and coffee shop.
<p>
<b>Ripley's Mueso de lo Incre’ble</b><br>
Just as with many other locations around the world, Mexico has its own Believe-It-or-Not Museum. Children enjoy this museum, with its 14 exhibit rooms filled with believe-it-or-not items on display.  Admission is about $3 for children, $5 for adults.  The museum is open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.-7 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m.-7 p.m. For information, call INT-52-5-546-3784. 
<p>
<b>Reino Aventura</b><br>
Located on the southern edge of Mexico City, this 100-acre theme park, composed of six "villages"-- Mexican, French, Swiss, Polynesian, American and Children's World--features numerous shows, including performances by trained dolphins. Admission is about $12, which includes all rides (senior citizens and children receive discounts). The park is open Tuesday-Friday 10 a.m.-6 p.m. and on weekends from 
10 a.m.-8 p.m. 
<p>
<b>Butterflies</b><br>
For nature lovers, there's El Rosario Reserve in Michoacan, where each year some 35 million Monarch butterflies (Mariposa Monarca) come from as far away as Canada to cover the pine and oak forests in the mountains.  Contact Steppingstone Environmental Educational Tours United States and Canada, (800) 874-8784.
<p>
The weekly Spanish leisure magazine El Tiempo Libre (Free Time) includes a children's section called El Ni–os, which lists children's activities happening in Mexico City. Also listed are weekend activities in the zocalos (main square) of towns throughout Mexico. The magazine can be purchased at any newsstand and can be easily translated with the help of a hotel concierge or Spanish/English dictionary.
<p>
<b><font size=+1>CANCUN-TULUM CORRIDOR</font></b><br>
<p>
Cancun has made Mexico's Caribbean one of the most popular playgrounds. However, most people don't realize that south of Cancun and opposite Cozumel, a region is taking shape as Mexico's newest, and most unique, vacation land. This string of beautiful beaches and ruins along the Yucatan Peninsula, are fast becoming one of Mexico's favorite family vacation spots. Beginning with Cancun and heading southward along the corridor, are some great day-trip possibilities.
<p>
<b>Mexico Magico</b><br>
The first theme park along the Mexican Caribbean, Mexico Magico Cancun offers musical entertainment on nine stages, as well as dinner shows at eight restaurants in six mini-villages. Each village covers a different theme--the Mayan past, a classic Mexican town, the Belle Epoque in Mexico, circa 1900, the Mexican Revolution and the Roaring '20s. Admission is $20. The park is open daily from 5 p.m.-midnight. The ticket booth at the entrance, opens at 4 p.m. For information call INT-988-3-49-80/3-49-86).

<p>
<b>Sian Ka'an Biophere Reserve</b><br>
Families can learn about and experience one of the most important coastal ecosystems in Mexico at Sian Ka'an, which in the local Mayan dialect means "where the sky is born."  The reserve, about 100 miles from Cancun, is composed of roughly one-third tropical forests, one-third wetlands and one-third marine environments. And Sian Ka'an's barrier reef, the Gama Reef, forms part of the second-longest such reef in the world.
<p>
A visit to Sian Ka'an includes a look at a farming project (one of the newest under way) and a boat trip on the Chunyaxche Lagoon, a water route once used by the ancient Mayans. During the trip, the guide points out the various species of birds that inhabit the reserve, such as blue herons, belted kingfish and woodstorks. At one point, the boat stops in a tiny inlet, where you can swim and go snorkeling.
<p>
Full-day trips from your Cancun hotel can be arranged, with departures at 7 a.m. and returns around 6 p.m. Tours cost about $57 per person for those who drive to the designated starting point, $115 from Cancun. This trip is ideal for children 12 and over. To make tour arrangements, contact Amigos de Sian Ka'an, Apartado Postal 770, Cancun 77500, Quintana Roo, or call INT-98-84-95-83.
<p>
<b>Xcaret</b><br>
Xcaret, "Nature's sacred paradise," is a family-oriented theme park that makes a perfect day trip from Cancun or Akumal.

<p>
<b>Puerto Aventuras</b><br>
Puerto Aventuras, a 900-acre self-contained resort about 60 miles south of Cancun, is an excellent home-base option for day trips.

<p>
<b>Indiana Jones Jungle Adventures</b><br>

 <p>
<b>CEDAM Underwater Archeology Museum</b><br>

The exhibit includes a collection of belt buckles, cannons, coins, guns, tableware and various clay relics from Mayan ruins along the Quintana Roo coast. Admission free. Call INT-987-3-51-29.
<p>
<b><font size=+1>Akumal</font></b><br>
<p>
For exploring the Yucatan, Hotel Club Akumal Caribe (915/584-3552 or 800/351-1622) also makes a wonderful home base, with the above day trips, and more, only "a hop, skip and a jump" away! Hotel Club Akumal Caribe is a family-oriented resort hotel located on the beach that offers a wide variety of accommodations ranging from two-bedroom suites (complete with two baths, living room and kitchen facilities) to two-bedroom condominiums. Satellite TV is available, as well as three restaurants. Activities available at the resort include diving, kayaking, windsurfing, snorkeling, fishing, tennis, jungle walks, and a private pool. 
<p>
Akumal proper consists of a large resort and a small Mayan community. It first attracted international attention in 1926, when explorers discovered the Mantanceros. First and foremost, however, Akumal is famous for its diving, but is also a bird sanctuary. Deep-sea fishing is also popular. Akumal is located 65 miles from Cancun and about four and a half miles from Puerto Aventuras.
<p>
<b>Xel-Ha</b><br>
Just outside the archaeological site of Tulum, this "natural aquarium," considered sacred by the Mayas, consists of 10 acres of stunning lagoons, coves and inlets naturally carved into the area's soft limestone terrain. Teeming with exotic fish, Xel-Ha is excellent for snorkeling. Visitors can explore underwater caves and cenotes deep in the jungle and travel to the far side of the lagoon by glass-bottom boats. Other attractions include a shrine and other small Mayan ruins, a maritime museum and a seafood restaurant. Xel-Ha is located 75 miles from Cancun and about 10 miles south of Akumal. It is currently closed for an unknown period for renovations.
<p>
<b><font size=+1>ACAPULCO</font></b><br>
<p>
A child's demand for fun and a parent's need to get away from it all blend magically in Acapulco. Although Acapulco is commonly considered an "adult playground," as a testament to its diversity, Acapulco also offers an abundance of activities that create a true tropical paradise for children. 
<p>
<b>CICI (Centro Internacional para Convivencia Infantil)</b><br>
Seal and dolphin shows are featured at CICI, one of Acapulco's premier attractions. This watersports park is a requisite visit for children of all ages. In addition to the enchanting animal shows, an aquarium, water slide and pool with man-made waves provide ideal spots to keep the kids cool and entertained in Acapulco's tropical sunshine. Older children who might enjoy more challenging watersports can take advantage of Acapulco's endless array of Pacific Ocean recreation, including water-skiing, snorkeling and windsurfing.  
<p>
<b>Aca-Zoo</b><br>
Families can experience the bounty of Acapulco's wildlife in preserved natural habitats at this small zoo on La Roqueta Island--the world's only island zoo. The zoo includes lions, alligators and zebras, as well as local endangered animals, such as howler monkeys, a jaguar, mountain lion and an ocelot. The island restaurant, Palao's, has a cove for swimming, a pony and a cage of entertaining monkeys. Kids especially enjoy the 10-minute boat ride from Caleta Beach. The ferry service to La Roqueta Island, including zoo admission is $4; a glass-bottom boat is $7. 
<p>
<b>Magico Mundo Marino</b><br>
Exotic ocean creatures await discovery at this marine-life park, located between the two picturesque coves of Caleta and Caletilla Beaches. Magico Mundo combines indoor and outdoor marine exhibits with a pool, water slides, scuba lessons and snorkeling- and jet-ski-equipment rental.  Admission is $7 for adults and $5 for children.

<p>
<b>El Fuerte de San Diego</b><br>
The Fort San Diego Historical Museum brings to life Acapulco's vivid past. Overlooking Acapulco's bustling harbor, the fort was originally built in 1616, and was rebuilt in the 18th century. It is now the home of the Museo Historico de Acapulco. Here children can imagine the days when the fort was used to ward off the attacks of marauding pirates, such as Sir Francis Drake, or brave the final battle of the Mexican War of Independence. For more information, call INT-52-74-82-3828 or 83-9730.
<p>
<b>Parque Papagayo</b><br>
In this 52-acre playland, youngsters can enjoy playing in a Spanish galleon replica modeled after ones that once sailed into Acapulco when it was Mexico's capital of trade with the Orient. The park, which also has an aviary, a roller-skating rink, a racetrack with mite-sized racecars, a replica of the Space Shuttle Columbia, bumper boats in a lagoon and other rides, is one of the top municipal parks in the country. Admission is free and rides cost $1.00-$3.50. The park is open daily from 10 a.m.-6 p.m. For more information, call INT-52-74-85-24-90.
<p>
Moms and dads who want to experience Acapulco's nightlife and adult-oriented adventures will find that many of Acapulco's hotels and resorts also satisfy the whims of younger guests.  Special programs and child-care facilities help parents make the most of their vacation without the guilt of leaving the kids behind.
<p>
The Hyatt Regency Acapulco offers special programs for summer and school holidays (INT-52-74-84-28-88). The Continental Plaza Hotels and Plaza Las Glorias Hotels waive costs for guests under the age of 12 in Acapulco and in the neighboring town of Manzanillo.

<b><font size=+1>FAMILY TRAVEL TIPS</font></b>
<p>
All children, including infants, must have proof of citizenship for travel to Mexico. Children traveling with a single parent must also have a notarized letter from the other parent stating that the child has his or her permission to leave the country. Although children can be listed on parents' tourist cards, it's a good idea to get separate tourist cards for everyone in your family. That way in an emergency one child will be able to leave the country with one parent if necessary.
<p>
English-speaking baby-sitters are available through a number of Mexico's large hotels and resorts. Ask the concierge at your hotel or the local tourist office for more information.

<center><font size=+2>MEXICO: A PARADISE FOR ACTIVE MATURE TRAVELERS</font></center>
<p>
Although Mexico is a country for people of all ages, it has become a mecca for the over-50 group of active mature travelers. In Mexico, they can discover the heights of volcanoes and the depths of Caribbean waters. They can trek Baja's desert in search of ancient petroglyphs or touch a whale, hook a marlin, go camping or sailing. They can join a caravan or motorcoach tour to cobblestoned colonial cities or they can further their knowledge of the Spanish language or a myriad of other subjects in schools throughout the country.
<p>
Mexico offers something that is hard to find anywhere these days--a gentle, slower pace of life, where sipping coffee spiced with cinnamon, while nibbling on pan dulce in a sidewalk cafe can seem to be the most important happening of the day. But along with this slower lifestyle comes a sense of adventure and curiosity that is at the heart of the mature traveler.
<p>
Generally, the cost of a vacation is considerably less expensive in Mexico than in the United States, allowing mature travelers on limited budgets to get more value. While there are increasing numbers of Americans retiring in Mexico, an even greater number are coming down for several months at a time, usually during the winter. Others are spreading their trips over the course of the year, experiencing festivals and celebrations that the normal summer vacationer misses.
<p>
Mature travelers today are not limited to those who passively sit on tour buses. Even those who choose the tour bus route will find a whole new style of travel.	Group tours of the '90s have taken on an entirely new look. Today's group traveler is tired of taking it sitting down. Buses loaded with passive, blue-haired onlookers have been replaced by sleek, fully-stocked motorcoaches transporting healthier-than-ever mature travelers determined to find their most exciting adventure yet.  
<p>
In order to meet the needs of this vigorous group traveler, tour operators from the United States and Canada are modifying their tour packages to emphasize action, adventure and uniqueness. They are finding that Mexico offers the perfect setting for their new-style adventures.
<p>
"Adventure," "action" and "environmentally-conscious travel" are among the new buzzwords in group tours. Mexico offers the variety that today's mature traveler is looking for. They truly appreciate the difference in culture and lifestyle they find in Mexico. They have the opportunity to leisurely stroll through the open-air markets, walk around the town squares, and enjoy a meal with local residents that may take several hours to complete.
<p>
In addition, many mature travelers are searching for more environmentally sensitive vacations. In a recent NTA study highlighting the lifestyles, attitudes and travel preferences of the mature American, more than 94% of those queried said they were concerned about the environment, and more than half said they were willing to pay more for an environmentally-sensitive tour. There has been an increased interest in anthropological and archaeological tours which offer new and exciting sites and temples to explore.
<p>
More tour operators are preparing their tour participants for what they can expect. Many are traveling to Mexico for the first time, and they have questions. By describing what they will experience on their tours, operators are eliminating the feeling of the unknown.
<p>
Currently, more than 120 tour operators from the United States and Canada offer group tours to Mexico. They travel in sleek deluxe motorcoaches, many of which are equipped with video players to show videotapes of where they are going. Other coaches come with fold-down tables and expanded galleys so that operators can offer continental breakfast and snacks on board. Some of these super-deluxe coaches are even being used as traveling seminar rooms, enabling participants to learn as they go.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Motorcoach Tour Choices</b></font>
<p>
Operators are offering versatile packages to a variety of destinations. For those who want to explore the history of Mexico, dating back to the ancient Mayans, there are new tours exploring Mundo Maya (the Mayan World). Some offer daytrips from the resorts of Cancun and Cozumel to the archeological sites of Chichen Itza, Coba and Tulum, or from MŽrida to Uxmal and Kabah. 
<p>
Others offer more complicated tours that take in many sites throughout the Yucat‡n Peninsula. Some operators provide experts in anthropology and archaeology who lead the more comprehensive tours.
<p>
Motorcoach tours are also an excellent way to explore Mexico's colonial cities. These tours take travelers through a mosaic of villages with cobbled streets, native markets, baroque churches and colonial architecture. Some visit working haciendas, others delve into the religious art of Mexico. One of the most popular has been the tour of Mexico's "Independence Route," beginning in Queretaro and continuing on to San Miguel de Allende and Guanajuato. Other tours take in the countryside around Guadalajara, including the Tarascan country of Lake Patzcuaro and Morelia.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Adventure Tours</b></font>
<p>
For a different kind of vacation, many mature travelers prefer one with action and some soft adventure, while exploring the environment. Tours involving whale watching are becoming popular all along the coast of Baja California. Others, involving hiking and birdwatching, snorkeling and scuba diving, take participants to the wilds of the Yucatan and far northern region of Copper Canyon.
<p>
Ever since Hernan Cortez brought the horse to Mexico, Mexicans have had a love of horseback riding. This is especially true of the ranch country of northern Mexico. From renting horses by the hour to more complicated horse expeditions and trail rides into Mexico's mountains, mature travelers will find lots of opportunities to suit their time, budget and skill level.
<p>
Up until recently, those interested in mountain climbing had little opportunity to do so. Ironically, in a country as endowed as Mexico is with mountainous terrain, there were few qualified guides. A new guide training program at the University of Quintana Roo in Chetumal will be providing guides in the near future. The three most popular climbs are Mexico's three highest volcanoes--Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl, near Mexico City, and Orizaba, in the State of Veracruz.	  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Studying in Mexico</b></font>
<p>
Students have studied Spanish in schools throughout Mexico for decades because the Spanish accent is among the purest in the Americas. Art is another subject of high regard, due to Mexico's rich tradition in painting, sculpture, jewelry making and folk art. Highly-rated language and art programs are available at universities throughout Mexico. Often corresponding departments of U.S. colleges and universities work with cooperative programs at Mexico's schools.
<p>
One of the most popular and most respected schools is the Instituto Allende in San Miguel de Allende. The town, itself, is a year-round center for artistic and language studies, and the Instituto Allende offers courses in the Spanish language (one-to-one instruction is available as well as group classes), as well as English-language calligraphy, pottery, painting, jewelry, and Mexican culture. For information, write Instituto Allende, San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico.

<center><font size=+2>IXTAPA/ZIHUATANEJO--MEXICO'S MELLOWEST RESORT</font></center>
<p>
Whatever version of paradise visitors see, almost all find it in Ixtapa. One young woman said, "People today don't want a hut on the beach. They want paradise, but they want it with luxury." Ixtapa gives its visitors just that, but with a mellow tone.
<p>
Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo is really two destinations in one--the lobster and champagne hotel zone of Ixtapa and the clams and beer laid-back village of Zihuatanejo. As Mexico's second preplanned "computer resort," developed by FONATUR, (The investment arm of MexicoÕs Ministry of Tourism) it is set on 24 miles of palm-lined beaches and coves, with rolling surf and pounding breakers. Development hasn't spoiled this magnificent resort. If anything, it's enhanced it.
<p>
Cessnas flew into the first airport in the early 1970s, and a local man was hired by FONATUR to chase away the pigs and cows. Now 153,000 live and work among the palms, but there's still only one gas station, and 80 percent of the residents own VCRs since there's only one movie theater. 
<p>
Ixtapa is geared to natural pleasures--the enjoyment of spectacular scenery, sports and sheer relaxation, with an average year-round temperature of 78F and 340 days of sun. The water is warm, the beach lit for nighttime strolls. There's parasailing, volleyball, sailing, water skiing, snorkeling and scuba diving. For those who aren't athletic, there are 16 beaches to lie on and let the world go by. And for those shop-'til-you-drop fanatics, there are now seven shopping centers between Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo with more than 1,000 shops selling everything from local handicrafts to fine Gucci leathers.
<p>
Ixtapa is only 150 miles up the coast from Acapulco. But geographically, it's another world. There are no movie stars gracing the pages of the local tabloids (In fact, there are no tabloids), no singles scene on the beach, and nightlife is limited to several discos and the local bars of Zihuatanejo.
<p>
Ixtapa, itself, is a modern development of a dozen highrise hotels that loom over Playa del Palmar, a two-and-a-half-mile long arc of fine sand that curves like a smile around Palmar Bay. A landscaped boulevard, with speed bumps every few feet to ease you into the pace of paradise, runs between them and an 18-hole Robert Trent Jones golf course, complete with exotic birds and two alligators that live on the fifth hole. 
<p>
Located on the stretch of Pacific coastline known both as the Mexican Riviera and the Costa Dorada (golden coast), due to the color of its sand and its spectacular sunsets, the resort is set against the lush, green backdrop of the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains.  
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Ixtapa Hotels</b></font>
<p>
In Ixtapa, world-class hotels line the two-mile stretch of broad sandy beach called Playa del Palmar. Across Ixtapa Boulevard are village-style shopping centers filled with boutiques, designer clothing, handicraft shops, cafes, and gourmet restaurants, all within walking distance from the hotels. 
<p>
Ixtapa, however, maintains its sense of space and communion with nature. Developed in the 1970s, Ixtapa's ecology-sensitive master plan allots half the land on the site to ecological reserves. Hotels and residential structures are limited in size, proportionate to their land area. Part of the original development, the Ixtapa Golf Club with an 18-hole par-72 course designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr. is, in itself, a wildlife reserve where alligators live in the water trap lakes.
<p>
Carefully controlled development continues. Near the hotel zone is the new 450-acre Marina Ixtapa with 622 yacht slips. A  promenade alongside the slips, lined with indoor-outdoor cafes, complements the nautical atmosphere. Overlooking it all, the 850-foot lighthouse called El Faro has a romantic bar featuring live music and panoramic views. The challenging 18-hole, par 72 Marina Golf Course, designed by Robert Von Hagge, is crisscrossed by canals.
<p>
All of Ixtapa's major hotels are on the beach. Along the Playa del Palmar "hotel zone" is the five-star Sheraton, with its glass-enclosed elevator overlooking its huge atrium lobby with its restaurants, bar, tropical plantings and the pool beyond. 
<p>
If the Sheraton is a classic luxury hotel, the Gran Turismo Westin Brisas Ixtapa is something else entirely. Built into a hillside overlooking its own beach, it features a terraced design to give every room a spacious open lanai complete with a hammock. The stark, angular look of the property, almost disconcerting at first, is softened by lush landscaping in the public areas. Four swimming pools are connected by cascading waterfalls, with the entire multi-level pool area designed to create an atmosphere of intimacy.<p>
<p>
The Krystal Ixtapa Hotel remains one of the most consistent, with excellent service and food. Its beachside terrace is well known as a site for weddings.
<p>
One of the most uniquely decorated hotels along Ixtapa Boulevard is the Doubletree Resort (formerly the Omni Hotel), a property filled with lots of Mexican artwork. Himie Mueller, its owner/architect, combines the elegance of a luxury hotel with Mexican hospitality in its interior with heavy emphasis on designs from the State of Michoacan, from tiles in its hallways to murals in its restaurants. Its bright cheery lobby with large carved wooden columns is a celebration of Mexican folk design. A unique bullfighting theme restaurant with a turn-of-the-century Mexican cafe atmosphere complete with marble bar and photos of matadors has a wooden floor and menu on the wall listing the tapas served.  
<p>
The Dorado Pacifico Hotel, a neat property with small rooms, each with fantastic views of beach, is an example of understated elegance. It, too, has been newly redecorated and all its mechanical works have been overhauled. The long-closed Aristos Hotel has finally opened and has been given a new coat of bright pink paint and new interior decoration.
<p>
While few new hotels have been added in Ixtapa, some have changed their identities. The former Aquamarina Hotel is now the Fontan Ixtapa, a four-star property. The Holiday Inn, for a short time the Plaza Ixtapa, is once again the Holiday Inn Sunspree Resort. The Presidente Hotel is now the Presidente Ixtapa Forum Resort, Ixtapa's third all-inclusive property preceded by Club Med and the new Qualton Club Resort out on Playa Quieta.  The four-star Posada Real is still an old standby. An exquisite inland option is the deluxe six-suite Villa del Lago bed & breakfast adjacent to the course of the Ixtapa Golf Club.
<p>
These hotels are equipped with everything needed for a luxury vacation--poolside gardens, tennis courts, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, boutiques, hairstyling salons, meeting and banquet facilities, and travel agencies for local tours. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>New Developments</b></font>
<p>
The newest look to Ixtapa is inland. Under construction just north of the marina on a point of land forming the north end of Palmar Bay is Punta Ixtapa, a development of private condos and villas and a possible luxury hotel, exclusive beach club, shopping center and sports complex. Renowned Mexican architect Diego Villasenor designed the layout around and within the area's already existing trees and lush vegetation. 
<p>
At the southern end of Palmar Bay lies Trapiche Ixtapa, a development of three luxurious condo buildings designed by well-known Mexican architect Julio Madrazo, who recently completed Trapiche Lomas, an exclusive residential condo complex in Cuernavaca.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Zihuatanejo Hotels</b></font>
<p>
Zihuatanejo's hotels nestle on hillsides and beaches along the scenic sheltered bay, and in the center of town. They range from modest inns, such as the hillside Bungalows Pacificos with a panoramic bay view, to three exquisitely luxurious inns: Villa del Sol nestled on La Ropa Beach, a member of Relais & Chateaux; La Casa que Canta terraced on a steep bluff; and Puerto Mio just inside the mouth of the bay with its own yacht marina. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Dining</b></font>
<p>
Since the waters off the Pacific coast are renowned for superb fishing, it's only natural that the dining spots throughout Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo offer delicious seafood. An array of fresh lobster, oysters, clams and shrimp is available. Locals prefer eating huachinango or red snapper and dorado, locally referred to as dolphin fish, while watching the sunset.
<p>
While the number of restaurants is constantly growing, two old standbys set the tone--Villa de la Selva and Bogart's. The first is an elegant hillside establishment set in the charming former home of Mexico's former president Luis Echeverria. Sauce-smothered seafood and flaming Cafe Royal are its specialties. The second is a chic restaurant in the Krystal Hotel with a romantic Casablanca ambiance. Specialties here include Persian crepes, duck Shanghai, and Caribbean lobster.
<p>
One of the newest eateries is in El Faro, the marina lighthouse, a  replica of a 19th-century lighthouse with an international menu, including prime U.S. meat, seafood casseroles and pasta, by chef Erick Du Bael. Anyone who climbs the 54-foot tower and rings the bell gets a drink on the house. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Nightlife</b></font>
<p>
Ixtapa's nightlife is sophisticated, sweet and simple. While the resort frequently imports big name entertainers, most visitors go dancing in one of several discos. Euphoria is a chic disco overlooking the ocean that's popular with locals and visitors alike. But the most spectacular one is still Christine, where young and old can dance to the wee hours--catching up on their ZZZs ma–ana on Zihuat's quiet beaches.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Activities</b></font>
<p>
Sports lovers and outdoor buffs can be active all day long in Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo. Activities range from premier golfing, tennis, scuba diving and the full scope of water sports, horseback riding, fishing and even bird watching.   
<p>
Deep sea fishing in Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo ranks among the world's best. The international Sailfish Tournament held in May (this year will be its eleventh), and the new Billfish Classic every January, bring together avid fishermen from around the globe. 
<p>
Scuba is surprisingly spectacular here, with opportunities for divers of all levels. There are over 30 dive sites and more are being discovered. Some are right inside Zihuatanejo Bay; others range from shallow coral reefs to deep caverns. NAUI Certification courses are available at the Zihuatanejo Scuba Center.
<p>
But for most, the beaches of Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo are all they need. Playa Quieta, where waters are clear and perfect for scuba diving, is just six miles beyond the hotel zone. Playa La Ropa, in the center of Zihuatanejo Bay, is two miles of pure paradise dotted with quaint seaside restaurants. Just beyond is Playa Las Gatas, once the private hideaway of a Tarascan princess, now a place to enjoy simple, open-air seafood restaurants, great swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving. This beach is accessible only by ferry from the municipal pier.
 <p>
No visit is complete without a trip to Isla Grande, also known as Isla Ixtapa, a scenic island and wildlife preserve a mile off Playa Quieta. This exotic hideaway comes complete with several crescent cove beaches and open-air restaurants with pet iguanas where visitors can sip fresh coconut juice right from the shell and eat cerviche (raw fish cocktail) with onions and hot peppers served with oranges, cucumbers and fresh lime juice. Charter boat trips are also available for fisherman to waters that are teeming with marlin, sailfish, and giant sea turtles.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Shopping is "Double Trouble"</b></font>
<p>
In Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo combined, there are more than 1,000 stores selling everything from hardware to fashion. At the handicraft markets in Zihuatanejo and in Ixtapa, shoppers can view artisan families hard at work making pottery, and many of the other crafts on sale. These markets evolved from a 1990 Guerrero State law which relocated all beach vendors to permanent stalls within the markets. 
<p>
In Zihuatanejo, Paseo del Pescador, the main beach promenade, is lined with small shops, stands and boutiques where avid shoppers or browsers can enjoy a leisurely walk and discover great bargains.
<p>
After shopping and relaxing on the beach, Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo comes to life with activities for every taste.  During high season (November to April), some of Ixtapa's major hotels feature once-a-week "Mexican Fiesta Nights" starting around 7:00 p.m., with elaborate buffet dinners, live folkloric music and dance performances, as well as handicraft bazaars for shopping. All night discos can be found in Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo offering live music and special theme nights.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Getting There</b></font>
<p>
Aeromexico and Mexicana airlines operate several nonstop flights throughout the day between their Mexico City hub and Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo. Flights to Mexico City on other carriers can connect to these Aeromexico or Mexicana flights. Direct or connecting flights are also available from Mexicana and Aeromexico U.S. gateway cities. TWA flies non-stop from St. Louis and Continental Airlines from Houston. The Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo international airport is 6.2 miles east from Zihuatanejo and 10.6 miles from Ixtapa.
<p>

<center><font size=+2>ALL-INCLUSIVE RESORTS TAKING HOLD IN MEXICO</font></center>
<p>
All-inclusive resorts have hit the beaches in Mexico. They advertise one price for everything--bed, food, drink, entertainment. Beginning in Puerto Vallarta and Cancun, they have now spread well beyond.
<p>
Aside from Club Med, which opened the first of its five Mexico properties in 1974, all-inclusives here have taken over one-fifth of the market in the past four years. And more are opening all the time. 
<p>
In the Cancun area, Club Robinson, the European all-inclusive, has opened Club Robinson Tulum. And it plans to build two more. The Melia Mayan and El Cozumeleno have recently opened.
<p>
In Ixtapa and Los Cabos, the former Intercontinental Presidente Hotels have become the all-inclusive Presidente Forum Resorts.
<p>
Allegro All-Inclusive, formed when Caribbean Village Clubs and Resorts and Diamond Hotels and Resorts merged, has opened six new all-inclusives in the past two years and is planning two more. These include its top-of-the-line Diamond Resorts, the activity focused Caribbean Villages and the economical ValuClubs.
<p>
Tour operators are pairing the room rate with airfare and selling them at astonishingly low prices, driving people out of their houses and on vacations rather than to buy a new refrigerator. One operator said that if there is a choice between a new rug for the foyer and a stay at a Mexican all-inclusive, people will walk on wood after they return from sipping margaritas on the beach.
<p>
All-inclusives have been increasing every year. Those such as Diamond Village, the Beach Palace, and the Sun Palace in Cancun are so popular that reservations are in high demand.  The Royal Solaris and Club Las Velas, also in Cancun, and Jack Tar Village in Puerto Vallarta and Sierra Radison Cancun, are some of the most popular.
<p>
All-inclusives are especially attractive to families with kids--one price, no surprises, leave your wallet at home. Many also include day care and other activities. These resorts allow people to enjoy the vacation time they have to a higher degree. It's not just the portal-to-portal price, but security as well.
 <p>
No one can take the name all-inclusive at face value. In Mexico, all-inclusive generally means all meals, most land-based activities that are on-site, and alcoholic drinks at meals and sometimes between. Most charge for imported liquor and some charge for wine with meals. Likewise some charge for watersports, others include everything as long as it is part of a scheduled activity.  All-inclusives are more popular for three- or four-night vacations than they are for seven. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Selected All-Inclusive Resorts</b></font>
<p>
The Diamond Resort Playacar, for example, located in Playa del Carmen 30 miles south of Cancun, offers a village atmosphere with shaded pathways leading throughout the entire complex. Its main restaurant serves buffets for all three meals and two specialty restaurants offer a la carte Mexican and Italian cuisine. The all-inclusive price includes unlimited alcohol, soft drinks and juices, a cocktail party, entertainment, a kids activity program, watersports for scheduled activities (others extra), clinics for all sports, and babysitting for a fee. Two more Diamond Resort Hotels can be found in Nuevo Vallarta and on the island of Cozumel. 
<p>
Diamond Resort's sister property, the Caribbean Village Playacar, located next door in Playa del Carmen, offers bungalows built around a shared championship golf course. This off-the-beach resort offers a shuttle to the Diamond's beach. While everything is nearly the same as the more luxurious Diamond Resort, wine is served with dinner and alcoholic beverages are limited to national brands. A more family-oriented place, kids under six stay free and a kids program is offered for those six to twelve.
<p>
The third part of the Allegro trio is its ValuClub in Puerto Vallarta. This 250-room resort caters mainly to budget-minded travelers. Though it, too, isn't on a beach, the nearest one is just a stroll away.
<p>
One of the newest conversions is the 100-room El Cozumeleno Hotel on Cozumel. This Bounty all-inclusive resort offers a program for the value-minded guest modeled after other Bounty properties. Unlike the Allegro hotels, it offers a buffet breakfast, sit-down lunch and dinner, hors d'oeuvres, barbecues, snacks, unlimited alcohol (house wine, domestic beer and cocktails), and a supervised Camp Bounty for kids, as well as sightseeing tours, entertainment, roundtrip transfers, taxes, tips, and baggage handling.
<p>
One of the best family all-inclusives is the 400-room Presidente Forum Resort Ixtapa. More than 70 percent of its rooms are adjoining. Unlike some of the other all-inclusives, packages to this resort can differ according to price. Some include taxes and gratuities, while others do not. Two of the unusual amenities here are the free dance and Mexican cooking lessons. There's also a children's camp, the Chiqui Club. Most watersports equipment is included, but wave runner and banana boat rentals, parasailing, sightseeing and scuba gear are not.
<p>
The El Dorado Resort, set along a pristine one and a half mile beach along the Tulum coast one hour south of Cancun, is a totally Mexican operation. Unlike many of the other all-inclusives, it offers true Mexican hospitality and some unusual perks. For instance, all rooms are one-bedroom suites with ocean views from porches or balconies, and come equipped with full baths, ceiling fans and hammocks. Guests receive in-room champagne upon check-in and its restaurant offers a la carte gourmet meals, as well as made-to-order meals. Lobster is served twice weekly, and there is room service. Unlike the others, all meals are served, no buffets are offered. Guests feel pampered here, offering an opportunity for stress reduction.

<center><font size=+2>FONATUR: THE FINANCIAL FORCE FOR
TOURISM GROWTH IN MEXICO</font></center>
<p>
The government of Mexico has long recognized the increasing importance of tourism to the nation's economy. More than 30 years ago a national plan--The National Trust Fund for Tourism Development or FONATUR--was drafted for the responsible development of the country's unique tourism assets.
<p>
FONATUR is the result of the merger of two government agencies, the National Fund for Tourist Infrastructure (Infratur), charged with developing infrastructure for tourism sites, and the Tourism Guarantee Fund (Fogatur), charged with financing hotel and integrated tourist developments.  It is currently the institution in charge of coordinating and promoting the expansion and improvement of Mexico's tourism infrastructure. It also oversees the development of Mexico's five internationally-known, integrally-planned tourism centers of Cancun, Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo, the Bays of Huatulco, Los Cabos and Loreto. 
<p>
The agency, which began planning and developing these resorts in the mid-1970s, has become a model for other countries with fledgling tourism industries.
<p>
Terrain, market factors, and the feasibility of developing infrastructure such as sewage, electrical power and communications systems were all studied rigorously before development of the resorts began. Now that they have been established, their support, control, and development is being maintained. FONATUR also is committed to preserving the ecological viability of the locations it develops.
<p>
Working with tourism investors, operators, and entrepreneurs, FONATUR today encompasses three major programs:   development and consolidation of existing resorts; financing of tourism projects, including that for construction, amplification and remodeling in any region of the country; and encouragement of direct investment. The newest and most important aspect of FONATUR's program is the development of integrated project sites.
<p>
Development and consolidation of existing resorts includes infrastructure and real estate development. FONATUR carries out the development of the projects' facilities and then sells and/or leases the land and buildings. The agency is also responsible for property management, operation and maintenance.
<p>
FONATUR's financing activities include the provision of all types of capital for the construction, expansion and remodeling of hotels and other tourism facilities throughout Mexico. Between 1974, the year it was created, and 1993, FONATUR granted some $1.3 billion in financing for tourism projects.
<p>
The agency's integrated project program, also known as its "megaproject" program, involves an overall strategy for the development of selected tourism destinations with FONATUR's financial and promotional support. The plan designates uses for land, keeping in mind the area's natural resources and other ecological concerns. After formulating the plan, FONATUR then markets and sells the underlying real estate to domestic and foreign investors. "Megaprojects" are now either completed or underway in all of FONATUR's resorts.
<p>
When the current 14 megaprojects have been completely developed, they will have attracted some $8 billion in investment, created over 300,000 jobs, received over four million visitors a year, and generated some $3 billion annually in foreign exchange. FONATUR recoups its investments through the sale of land parcels or its equity share in specific tourism projects.
<p>
Mexico's "open arms" policy to foreign investors has led to a renewed and explosive growth in the tourism industry.  Liberalized foreign investment regulations are responsible for much of the growth in development. The government's successful privatization efforts have also contributed to higher levels of investment. Not surprisingly, 20 percent of all recent foreign investment has been channeled into the tourism sector.
<p>
The Mexican government now allows 100 percent foreign ownership in a wide range of industry sectors, and foreign entities now can invest in Mexico's coastal and border areas, once restricted from any kind of foreign investment, through a real estate investment trust. The mechanism permits foreign investors to obtain the economic benefits that accompany equity ownership in some of Mexico's most attractive tourism industry properties.
<p>
The following is a list of the latest developments in each of FONATUR's five integrally-planned tourism centers:
<p>
<b>Cancun</b>
<p>
The completed infrastructure at Cancun now makes it the most important and largest tourism destination in the country.  Inaugurated in 1974, it has grown to nearly 20,000 rooms, distributed in hotels ranging from inexpensive to the "grand tourism" category. 
<p>
Cancun alone welcomes close to two million visitors annually, generating over $1.3 million in foreign currency income.  More than 75 percent of all visitors to Cancun are foreigners, and Cancun is a leading competitor of the world's Caribbean destinations. Cancun also receives more flights from the United States, Europe and Canada than any other Mexican tourism destination.
<p>
Megaprojects in Cancun include: "Puerto Cancun," a nautical tourist development, with two 18-hole golf courses, a polo field and more than 4,000 hotel rooms; "Malecon Cancun", a tourism and urban center, and "Ruinas del Rey," home to the new 400-room Ceasar-park Hotel, an 18-hole golf course and a real estate subdivision.  The Mexican investment groups, D.S.C. Turismo and Constructora La Nacional, in conjunction with FONATUR, apportioned $49 million in order to initiate the projects in 1991.
<p>
<b>Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo</b>
<p>
Since 1975, hotel accommodations in Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo have increased ten-fold, so that today it has more than 4,000 rooms, grouped into 14 hotels of the grand tourism category.
<p>
Zihuatanejo, which offers more moderate accommodations--with the exception of three exclusive, top-quality small hotels--has more than 700 rooms.
<p>
"Marina Ixtapa," a new marina, golf course, hotel and apartment development, "Punta Ixtapa," a residential and hotel development, and "Azul Ixtapa," a luxury condominium project, all have added to the amenities offered to visitors.
<p>
<b>Los Cabos</b>
<p>
In recognition of the fact that the twin resorts of San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas are international sport fishing meccas, FONATUR constructed a marina with 320 slips around hotels and residential condominiums. Los Cabos has more than 3,000 rooms distributed in 36 hotels.
<p>
However, this is just the beginning of explosive growth that is taking place here, especially in Cabo San Lucas.  Many foreign investors are taking advantage of opportunities for new business.  While FONATUR is not seeking investment in any megaprojects in Los Cabos at this time, there are some large- and small-scale private sector projects. 
<p>
<b>Loreto</b>
<p>
Loreto is FONATUR's smallest integrally-planned tourism center, with 15,000 inhabitants and five hotels, targeted mainly at sport fishing aficionados. To the south of Loreto is Punta Nopolo, a tourism development which already has a four-star hotel, a beach club, an 18-hole golf course, and tennis center with a stadium and eight courts. 
<p>
This area now has seven hotels and construction of two additional hotels is planned for FONATUR's megaproject site, Puerto Loreto. These hotels will add 500 hotels to Loreto's capacity.
<p>
Future growth in Loreto is expected with the completion of a new FONATUR "Puerto Loreto" megaproject, a nautical, residential and hotel development located 25 kilometers south of Loreto. By the year 2000, the port is expected to attract nearly 8,000 sporting boats. Three grand turismo hotels are currently under construction, with a total of 750 rooms.
<p>
<b>The Bays of Huatulco</b>
<p>
The Bays of Huatulco is considered one of the most ambitious long-term tourism projects undertaken by the Mexican government.  With more than two-thirds of the development to be kept as an ecological preservation, it may well become the prototype for future tourism projects. 
<p>
Currently, the Bays of Huatulco has 15 hotels with more than 1,700 rooms. Planned megaprojects include "Puerto Chahue," a marina with nautical and residential areas, and "Bahia de Cacaluta," a complete resort with a marina and a golf course.

<center><font size=+2>RAIL TRAVEL SHOWCASES MEXICO'S SCENIC WONDERS</font></center>
<p>
Ever since the arrival of the steamed locomotive, Mexico has been a mecca for rail travel enthusiasts. More than 15,000 miles of railroad lines connect its mountains, coasts and jungles, affording tourists a leisurely way of enjoying the countryside.  
<p>
Train routes through Mexico are as diverse as the country's cuisine. Travelers unafraid of heights will be thrilled to view  three-hundred-foot cliffs directly beneath one of the 48 bridges aboard the Chihuahua al Pacifico Railroad through majestic Copper Canyon. Those who enjoy the golden glow of brilliant sunsets as they silhouette old haciendas will enjoy riding through the Bahio on their way to the colonial interior. 
<p>
But the most spectacular rail journey in Mexico is through  Copper Canyon, an area four times larger than the Grand Canyon of the United States. The train takes passengers through a maze of lush gorges and more than 80 tunnels as it climbs from sea level to 8,000 feet. Travelers have the option to board the train either in Chihuahua, Chihuahua; Los Mochis, Sinaloa; or El Fuerte, Sinaloa; and may travel the fourteen-hour journey from one end to the other. However, most rail packages include overnight stays in the Canyon, stopping in such places as Divisadero, Barrancas and Creel.  
<p>
For those who prefer to remain on tierra firme, Mexico offers train packages to more than 20 colonial cities in the country's interior. Excursions depart almost daily from Mexico City to many of the country's most beautiful colonial cities, including San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Queretero and San Luis Potosi. Many of these excursions depart from Mexico City's central train station, Estacion Central de Buenavista, located at the intersection of Avenida Mosqueta and Insurgentes Norte.  Other trips that originate from Laredo and Eagle Pass in Texas, and Monterrey in Mexico, travel to such exotic cities as Oaxaca, Veracruz and Guadalajara.
<p>
For those who want luxury, DRC Rail Tours offers an exquisite, seasonal, all-inclusive rail excursion via its private train, the South Orient Express. Specifically designed for the Copper Canyon route, it features lavish turn-of-the-century-style passenger cars, all glass vista domes, elegant bars and world-class gourmet cuisine. During March, April, October and November, passengers enjoy the deluxe service, cuisine and views during the day and depart the train to retire in quaint hotels every night.  
<p>
An alternative to taking the South Orient Express is DRC's new first class train operating daily in both directions--Chihuahua-Los Mochis and vice versa. 
<p>
Still another option for luxury train travel is The Sierra Madre Express offered by Tauck Tours. Combining five pullman cars, observation lounges and deluxe staterooms, tour participants spend two of seven nights of an all-inclusive eight-day package aboard the train.  
<p>
Consumers wishing to experience this new trend in Mexico tourism can call DRC Rail Tours (800) 659-7602 or Tauck Tours (800) 468-2825.

<center><font size=+2>MEXICO'S SPAS EASE LIFE'S EVERYDAY STRESSES</font></center>
<p>
Interest in fitness is on the rise around the world, and Mexico is no exception. Ever since the Aztecs first built a resort in the hills southwest of Mexico City to take advantage of the mineral waters there, visitors have been flocking to Mexico's famous spas. For centuries, Mexico's mineral springs have been recognized for their healing properties and for providing a way to soothe the stresses of everyday living.
<p>
Moctezuma II, the Aztec emperor, was one of Mexico's earliest spa enthusiasts. In fact, three of the mineral baths he visited regularly--Tenochtitlan, Oaxtepec, and Ixtapan de la Sal--are still in use today. These hot springs are heated from deep within the earth and are usually enriched with a host of minerals, such as at Tequisquiapan.   
<p>
A number of Mexican spas or balnearios are true resorts, with all the amenities. Others are mainly places to "take the waters," either outside in natural mineral springs or inside in spring-fed pools. Many towns have public balnearios or natural spring waterbaths, offering swimming pools of mineral-rich spring water, which can be volcanically warmed or icy cold. Balnearios are particularly well known in the Mexican towns of Ixtapan de la Sal, San Miguel de Allende, Morelia, Chapala, Tequisquiapan, Uruapan and Tehuacan.  
<p>
Seekers of relaxation will find at least one licensed spa in every Mexican state except Yucat‡n and Quintana Roo, with hundreds of thermal springs as yet "undiscovered" throughout the country. However, spa enthusiasts will find a variety of spas from the no-frills types to super-deluxe spas with state-of-the-art equipment, where guests are treated like royalty.  

	Of the more than 570 known warm water mineral springs in the country, most can be found in the states of Aquascalientes (hot waters), Guanajuato, Michoacan, Puebla, Morelos, Queretaro, San Luis Potosi, and Mexico. However, today the word spa conjures up more than mineral springs and Mexico has it all. 
<p>
Most hotel spas offer a wide range of health and beauty options: facials and massages; body wraps with herbs and mineral salts; yoga; tai chi, reflexology sessions; hair styling; nail care; vapor; sauna; and daily personalized exercise sessions.  Outdoor sports from horseback riding and tennis to five-mile nature walks are available to suit a variety of interests. 
<p>
Among Mexico's hotel spas are a number of special-interest resorts. These spas pay special attention to such activities as golf at Hotel Avandaro Golf and Spa Resort, fitness at Rancho la Puerta and beach activities at Body and Sol at Puerto Aventuras Resort.
<p>
A good way to find the spa that matches a particular set of interests and expectations is The Spa Finder, an international guide published by Frank van Putten.  For more information, or to request a guide, call (800) 255-7727 or (212) 924-6800.

<p>
Mexico is just like any other foreign country--a different culture means different foods, different customs, different standards.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Safety</b></font>
<p>
Mexico is safe. In fact, Mexico is safer than many other countries because its people generally care about the comfort and safety of visitors.  However, still things happen.  Many visitors do not respect the culture that they are visiting and, in so doing, may inadvertently fall victim to circumstances.
<ul>
<li>To have a safe trip in Mexico, visitors should get to know and heed the local laws.  Mexican law is based on the Napoleonic Code and is extremely complex.  First tip is: Do not break the law.
<p>
<li>To prevent theft, visitors should be careful not to tempt thieves.
<p>
<li>Keep all valuables in hotel safe deposit boxes or hidden from view when not in use.
<p>
<li>Do not leave cameras or other items in view in your hotel room when you are  not in.
<p>
<li>Keep your passport and other documents on you in safety pouches.  Keep copies of the identification pages (in a separate place) in case they are lost or stolen.
<p>
<li>Carry only enough money on you to get through the day.
<p>
<li>Support those who are selling legitimate goods; avoid those asking for handouts.
<p>
<li>Report any theft immediately to the authorities.
</ul>
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Healthy Eating</b></font>
<p>
One of the proverbial concerns of tourists visiting Mexico is getting sick while on vacation.  Not surprisingly, Mexicans involved in tourism are equally concerned.
<p>
Visitors most commonly complain of stomach upsets or indigestion.  These upsets happen everywhere, not only in Mexico.  Sometimes lack of sleep before a trip, nervousness, changes in altitude or too much sun can cause what is commonly called ÒtravelerÕs diarrhea.Ó
<p>
All it takes to avoid this problem is a little common sense and following these tips:
<ul>
<p>
<li>Eat lightly the first two days.  Eat the foods you normally do at home to give your body a chance to adjust.
<p>
<li>Avoid all tropical fruits for the first 24 hours.  Fruits like papaya and mango,  not often available in such quantities elsewhere, can take their toll.
<p>
<li>Avoid all spicy foods for at least 24 hours.  Many Mexican spices can be difficult on  foreign digestive systems.
<p>
<li>Go easy on the alcohol, especially in the hot sun.  Tequilla can have a bad effect in great quantity.  Drink Mexican beer or wine instead.
<p>
<li>Avoid dairy products, unpeeled raw vegetables and fruits, raw seafood and raw  meat.
<p>
<li>Avoid buying food from street vendors.
<p>
<li>Make sure all foods are served steaming hot.  Be extra careful of poultry and seafood in hot beach climates.
<p>
<li>Do not overindulge; Mexican food is very rich.
<p>
<li>Digestive problems have long been blamed on the MexicoÕs water.  In the last several years a concerted effort has been made to bring bottled purified water to everyone-- visitors and Mexicans, alike.  Bottled water is available everywhere from the tiniest store to the largest supermarket.  Hotels have begun to put it in all their rooms, even if they have purified water systems.
<p>
<li>All new hotels in Mexico are required to have purified water systems.  With the advances in technology, more and more are finding it good business to have their water purified.  When in doubt, ask.
<p>
<li>If drinking the water may be a problem (or using ice thatÕs made from unpurified water), drink the many varieties of ice cold carbonated  beverages, fruit juices, beer and wine or hot coffee or tea.
<p>
<li>If ÒtravelerÕs diarrheaÓ does strike, eat lightly and drink plenty of fluids.  To keep the symptoms from getting worse, take Pepto Bismol or Immodium A-D.  If symptoms still persist, see a doctor.  In any event, it is best to let travelerÕs diarrhea run its course, which should be a couple of days.

BACKGROUNDER
<p>
<center><font size=+2>FROM VERACRUZ TO PUEBLA --
TRACING THE ROUTE OF CORTES</font></center>
<p>
Where the rough Sierra Madre mountain range turns abruptly into lush coastal plains, and the waters of the Bay of Campeche rush up to meet rocky beaches and sandy dunes, the Old World first met the New with the arrival of Hernan Cortez on Good Friday, April 21, 1519.
<p>
There, some 250 miles east of what is now Mexico City, in a land rich with Mesoamerican Indian tribal culture, Cortez planted a cross and called it La Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz (the rich village of the true cross). In time, this naturally beautiful Gulf Coast stretch of land would become a principal point of entry for trade and commerce in the New World.
  <p>
Today, Veracruz City, Mexico's oldest colonial city, is also its principal port city,  and is much like pre-Castro Havana. Hot and sultry from lots of rain, the humidity can be overpowering any time of year. November to March is the best time to visit.
 <p>
The thriving city of Veracruz is a maze of old colonial-style buildings with balconies and iron grills lining its palm-treed, cobblestone streets. But while Veracruz's colonial setting harkens back to the days of early Spain, the personality of the city reflects its diverse population. Veracruz has seen its share of Spanish invaders, pirates, slave traders, armies from France and the United States, who mixed with the pre-hispanic indigenous peoples.
<p>
Although Veracruz is a popular destination for foreign tourists, visitors to this commercial center of almost half a million people are more likely to meet Mexican vacationers who are attracted to the sandy beaches, heaps of fresh grilled shrimp, the moderately priced accommodations that welcome families with children and the bustling life of the streets. Day and night the streets of Veracruz (hometown of the popular la bamba dance) are filled with the musical rhythms of marimbas and guitar-strumming trios that make it the ideal place to sample what "real" Mexico is like.
<p>
Cafe life here is the best in Mexico, since Veracruz is the entry point for many European immigrants. Each evening the 16th-century zocalo is alive with marimba bands playing to the crowds sitting at the dozens of cafes that line the perimeter. People come here to eat the local seafood--huachinango a las Veracruzana (red snapper in a rich tomato sauce), sopa de mariscos (seafood soup), and sopa de pescado (fish soup)--all originate from Veracruz and are now favorite dishes throughout the country.  
<p>
Some play dominos, while others munch on tropical fruit, sip rich coffee, and watch the people. The Palacio Municipal, or Town Hall, has an arched Moorish facade and a beautiful patio, while the 18th century colonial Nuestra Se–ora de la Asuncion church, known to locals as the Catedral La Parroquia, or the parish church, sits quietly opposite. For the best coffee in town, the Cafe la Parroquia is known throughout Mexico.
<p>
The 19th-century Aduana Maritima (Customs House) contains part of the wall from the old walled city and the tiny Baluarte de Santiago(Santiago's Fort) is the only remaining bulwark of the old wall.
<p>
In the Plaza Gutierrez Zamora, located about six blocks from the zocalo, is the church of Santo Christo del Buen Viaje, said to be one of the oldest churches in the New World. Nearby is the Mercado Hidalgo, where the butchers beat their knives on chopping blocks to Latin tunes and the witchcraft stalls are filled with potions. The Museo de Arte e Historia Veracruzana features excellent collections of archaeological material and art from the Olmec, Totonac and Huaxtec cultures.
<p>
A walk along Veracruz's malecon is worthwhile to watch the activity of the harbor. Here is the Museo Constitucionalista Venustiano Carranza, which houses a lighthouse and museum dedicated to former Mexican President Carranza. It was here at his residence that he met with fellow statesmen to hammer out the post-revolutionary Mexican Constitution. Across the street boats depart for harbor cruises, which include a running commentary on port sights sung out by the guide like a sailor's chant. 
<p>
Here, also, boats go to Castillo de San Juan de Ulua, a large island fortress and one of the town's landmarks. Begun by the Spaniards in 1528 to protect the town from attack by sea, it was later converted into a prison. Its bastions and parapets have helped shield the town against pirates, French invaders and American troops, and offer great views of the port. It is filled with eroded stairs, dungeonlike rooms, cobbled plazas and arched breezeways. 
<p>
Veracruz is also the centerpiece of a state that boasts some of Mexico's richest archeological sites, including the recently discovered El Pital, an ancient city made up of hundreds of pre-Columbian buildings, such as temples, ball courts and pyramids.
<p>
El Pital has been called the most significant find of the last two centuries. Buried under centuries-old forest vegetation, just 60 miles northwest of Veracruz City, El Pital is believed to have been one of the largest seaport cities and a key political, cultural and trade center 1,500 years ago. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>ACCOMMODATIONS IN VERACRUZ</b></font>
<p>
As Veracruz has grown in popularity, the number and quality of attractive and luxurious hotels has increased. 
<p>
The Emporio, a large centrally-located hotel on the malecon and facing the harbor, offers 201 rooms and some suites with jacuzzis. It has an indoor and an outdoor pool, two restaurants, two tennis courts, a piano bar and a disco. For information,  call INT-52-29-32-00-20.
  <p>
The Mocambo Resort Hotel, built in 1932, was one of the first beach resorts in Mexico, and is still famous for its sprawling grounds. Set on the side of a hill overlooking Veracruz's best beach, the hotel features a terrace facing the ocean, 128 spacious rooms, two restaurants, a piano bar, a tennis court, one outdoor and two indoor pools, a jacuzzi and a sauna.   For information, call INT-52-29-22-02-02.
<p>
Only five minutes from the beach and located conveniently next to the Veracruz Convention Center, the newly opened 235-room Continental Plaza Veracruz features a wide variety of modern amenities, including health club, pool, business center and two bars. For information, call INT-52-29-89-05-05.
<p>
Exclusive and comfortable, the smaller Playa Paraiso, located between the Mocambo and Emporio hotels, is every bit as beautiful. It features a group of sparkling-white, three-story buildings with 41 villas and 34 suites, complete with a restaurant, beach club and pool. For information, call INT-52-29-21-86-00.
<p>
Called the "pride of Veracruz," the Torremar is a modern resort on the edge of Mocambo Beach in Boca del Rio. This 176-room hotel offers a pool, tennis courts, a restaurant and lounge with live music, and meeting facilities. For information, call 
INT-52-29-21-34-75.
<p>
<font size=+1><b>TOWNS ALONG THE WAY</b></font>
<p>
<b>Fortin de las Flores</b>
<p>
West from Veracruz, just past the colonial town of Cordoba, (famous for the signing of the Treaty of Cordoba, which finalized Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821), is Fortin de las Flores (Small Fort of Flowers), whose endless fields of fruit orchards, azaleas, orchids, gardenias and other Mexican flowers provide a feast for the eyes. Many of the fresh flowers that line market stalls across the country are grown here.
<p>
Worth a night's stay is the charming Hotel Fortin de las Flores, formerly the Hacienda de las Animas and retreat of Emperor Maximilian and Empress Carlota from 1864 to 1867. The restful two-story peach-colored hotel offers guests elegant gardens, a pool, tennis courts, a boutique, wonderful service and 86 rooms and suites (some with kitchenettes) each with cable television. For information, call INT-52-271-3-00-55.
<p>
<b>Coatepec</b>
<p>
Surrounded by citrus orchards, coffee and banana plantations is the charming 18th-century colonial town of Coatepec. Winding inlaid stone streets with balconies overhanging the sidewalks are the hallmark of this small town of 10,000 people. Coatepec also is known for its talabarteria saddlery leather crafts, including furniture, fine saddles and hand-tooled leather portraits, as well as its cafeto handicrafts such as knives, letter openers, figurines and even elaborate clocks, all carved from the blond wood of coffee roots.
<p>
Blending traditional colonial architecture with an Andalusian-style layout, the Posada Coatepec remains one of Mexico's most beautiful country inns. Converted from a coffee-processing plant in the 1800's, this exquisite inn has a lobby furnished with local antiques, a flower-filled garden, a courtyard and talavera-tile swimming pool. There are 18 suites and 5 luxurious double rooms, and the new Villa Coatepec two-story suite, in its own expansive garden.  The inn, located two blocks from the main square called Parque Hidalgo, also features individual jacuzzis, a spa room with sauna, and the Maria Enriqueta restaurant, which serves superb Mexican gourmet dishes. For information, call INT-52-281-6-00-40.
<p>
<b>Jalapa</b>
<p>
Ten minutes north of Coatepec and surrounded by coffee plantations, Jalapa (or Xalapa), the capital of Veracruz State, is home to one of Mexico's finest public universities. On a clear day this hill town offers a dramatic view of Mexico's highest mountain, snowcapped Orizaba. Just north of downtown, past sloping streets and hidden alleys, sits one of Mexico's most impressive museums. The Museo de Antropologia, which houses one of the most complete collections of the history of regional culture, including the famous 22-ton, stone-carved heads of the 3,000-year-old Olmec culture, is a feast for the eyes and a contemporary architectural marvel.
<p>
<b>Papantla and El Tajin</b>
<p>
The center of Mexico's vanilla industry, Papantla is most famous for its voladores, who perform a breathtaking religious ritual hundreds of years old. A group of five men climb a 100-foot pole to a tiny platform, tie their waists to colorful ropes wrapped around the pole, and hurl themselves off in a spiralling downward motion to the rhythm of traditional drumbeats.   
<p>
Eight miles west of Papantla, immersed in the dark-green jungle, lies El Tajin, one of Mexico's most important but often-overlooked archeological sites. Once thought to have been Mexico's most influential religious and commercial center a thousand years ago, El Tajin sits half-buried in the first foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental. Housing the spectacular six-level Pyramid of the Niches, El Tajin also is home to 11 ball courts, on which an ancient and sacred game was played. The courts are adorned with intricate bas-relief stone carvings, a tribute to the cultures that flourished there more than 1200 years ago.
<p>
<b>Tehuacan</b>
<p>
An hour and a half from Puebla, Tehuacan gives its name to its spring water, which is bottled and distributed throughout the country.  The Hotel Spa Pe–afiel is a fully equipped resort with pools of spring water that refresh the body and spirit.  The hotel also offers a variety of sports activities, and is about 30 miles from the superhighway that leads from Mexico City to Veracruz.
<p>
<b>Cholula</b>
<p>
On the western outskirts of Puebla, following the Avenida Reforma, is the town of Cholula, which is said to have a different church for each day of the year. Once a leading spiritual center in medieval central Mexico, Cholula is home to the Great Pyramid(the largest in Mexico), on top of which sits the exquisite blue and white Templo de Nuestra Senora de los Remedios. Just south of Cholula are the villages of San Francisco Acatepec and Santa Maria Tonantzintla, where visitors will find two of the most ornate and well-preserved churches in Mexico -- the San Francisco and the Santa Maria, respectively. 
<p>
<b>Tlaxcala</b>
<p>
The capital of Mexico's smallest state of the same name, the highland community of Tlaxcala is a colorful Indian town famed for its handloomed serapes and beautiful textiles. Located only an hour east of Mexico City, it is especially interesting to Church lovers. 
<p>
Tlaxcala became the home of the Tlaxcala Indians after they defeated the Aztecs at Lake Texcoco. An alliance with the Otomi Indians provided the military protection which allowed the Tlaxcalans time to advance their civilization. Their leaders were the second to ally with Cortez against the Aztecs.
<p>
The Convento de San Francisco, one block from the main square and just off the highway to Puebla, maybe the oldest church in North America. Services were held here before Cortez captured what is now Mexico City. Of interest in the present church dating from 1521 are the paintings, impressive altars, the decorated wood ceiling beams, which are carved and gilded after the Moorish fashion, and the font where the Tlaxcalan king, Xictencatl, was baptized a Christian. 
<p>
On a hill, about one mile away is the Basilica de Nuestra Senora de Ocotlan, erected on the site where the Virgin appeared in 1541 and promised to end a drought. Constructed in the 18th century, the interior of the church has an octagonal shrine to the Virgin. It took an Indian artist, Francisco Miguel, 20 years to execute the Baroque decorations.
<p>
About 20 miles southwest of Tlaxcala, is the Cacaxtla archaeology site which dates back from 700 AD. The site contains well-preserved frescoes showing colorfully attired figures of different ethnic groups. The largest mural depicts a battle of which 17 of the original 42 figures remain intact. 
<p>
<font size=+1><b>PUEBLA</b></font>
<p>
At one time, Puebla, the capital of the State of Puebla, was the most Spanish city in Mexico. Unlike most of the colonial towns built in the century after the fall of the Aztecs on the ruins of their cities and ceremonial centers, Puebla was established on virgin territory about 80 miles west of Mexico City.
<p>
Founded in 1531 by Cortez as a fortress town midway between the defeated Aztec capital and the east coast, it possesses some of the most important colonial art and architecture in Mexico.  Throughout the city's grid-shaped layout of streets and avenues there are a wide variety of churches and colorful mansions made of red brick, grey stone, white stucco and the city's famous blue and white Talavera tiles. The town was settled entirely by the Spanish, particularly by immigrants from Spain's Talavara region. Unlike the conquistadors before them, they brought their families and came to stay and make their fortunes in the New World.
<p>
The poblanos, as Puebla's residents are called, were very Spanish and the city became a pro-Spanish city during the colonial period and consequently a stronghold of the Catholic church. The city has more than 60 churches, most notable of which is the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, an elegant rendering of Herreriano architecture, built from 1562 to 1649. However, the most lavishly decorated church in the city is the Church of Santo Domingo, famous for its Rosary Chapel and the carvings on its walls. <p>
<p>
Besides its Talavera tiles, Puebla also is known for its ceramics and plaster decorations, and is a great place for household shopping. The area also is associated with camotes, a sweet-potato candy prepared with fruit and sugar; spicy mole a la poblana sauce, served over chicken and made of chile, spices and chocolate; rompope, a thick, delicious eggnog-type rum drink that doesn't need refrigeration; and china poblana, a style of women's dress that has almost become a national identity symbol.
<p>
Puebla's strategic position between Mexico City and Veracruz has influenced its history. Its moment of greatest drama occurred on May 5, 1862, when a makeshift Mexican army repulsed the first French contingent sent to Mexico by Napoleon III. Today, Cinco de Mayo is a national holiday.
<p>
<b>ACCOMMODATIONS IN PUEBLA</b>
<p>
El Meson del Angel is a luxury hotel with landscaped grounds on the edge of the city.  The hotel's 192 rooms offer balconies, refrigerators; some even have views of volcanoes. It also has pools and a tennis court, two restaurants and a bar. For information, call INT-52-22-203-0275 or 800/2-23-33.
<p>
 For the urban-oriented, the downtown Mision Park Plaza Puebla consists of three modern six-story towers with 225 rooms. Amenities include a gym, pool, jacuzzi, tennis court, garden, restaurants and three bars, one with live music. For information, call INT-52-22-48-96-00.
<p>
Also located in the heart of downtown Puebla is the charming colonial-style Posada San Pedro, which boasts 80 lovely rooms, a restaurant, bar and pool. For information, call 
INT-52-22-46-50-77.   

<b>GETTING TO VERACRUZ</b>
<p>
The Veracruz airport is located four miles from downtown Veracruz.  Reasonably priced van transportation is available into downtown Veracruz. The airport features several car-rental agencies, a small restaurant/bar and a shop. 
<p>
Both Aeromexico and Mexicana offer frequent flights between Mexico City and Veracruz, with convenient connections from their U.S. gateways. Connections are also available on other carriers serving Mexico City. Continental operates nonstop flights from Houston to Veracruz with connections from throughout the United States.  
<p>
Ultra-deluxe bus service on the UNO line has frequent service day and night from Mexico City to both Veracruz and Jalapa. Passengers must reserve seating and tickets can be purchased at travel agencies in Mexico City.  
<p>
<b>GETTING TO PUEBLA</b>
<p>
If you are driving to Puebla from Mexico City, the road east is a continuation of the Calzada Ignacio Zaragoza avenue after which you have the option of two roads. Highway 150D, the toll road which continues on to Veracruz, heads east from Mexico City, offering some fantastic vistas along the way. The older Highway 190, also quite scenic, is slower-going. Both will take approximately two to three hours. Buses and trains are also available from Mexico City.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<p>
<p>
<center><font size=+2>Christmas in Mexico:
 Spectacular Pageantry and Value</font></center>
<p>
Mexico, December 1995--As holiday joy echoes throughout the nation during the celebrated month of December, it is an appropriate time to raise awareness about celebrations in other countries.  Mexico, a country so close to the United States and Canada geographically, is remarkably distinct in its celebration of holidays, especially Christmas.
<p>
The year-end holiday season in Mexico offers unique pageantry and merriment.  The month of December in Mexico is magical.  More than the giving and receiving of gifts on one special day, Christmas in Mexico lasts the entire month.  A sampling of celebrations include:
<p>
<center><b>December 12 - Virgin of Guadalupe</b></center>
<p>
The first festival falls on December 12th and honors the patroness of Mexico, the Virgin of Guadalupe. The Feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe is MexicoÕs most religious holiday,  upon which millions of pilgrims from the entire nation converge at the Basilica shrine in Mexico City to pay tribute to this ultimate symbol of the country.  The shrine of Guadalupe is where the Virgin made her appearance before a humble peasant.  On the eve of the 11th, the square in front of the Basilica acts as a stage for a myriad of songs and dances.  In addition to the massive celebration in Mexico City, churches throughout the country engage in festivities.
<p>
<center><b>December 16-24 - Posadas</b></center>
<p>
Next to occur during the advent of Christmas are the posadas, which are processions and parties that reenact Joseph and MaryÕs journey to Bethlehem.  These processions on the evenings of December 16-24 pass through the streets with candles and stop at a designated house to ask for lodging.  At first the group is rejected, but alas, the door is opened and the joyous wanderers enter.   The ensuing party features the breaking of the traditional pi–ata.
<p>
<center><b>December 24 - Nochebuena</b></center>
<p>
On the eve of December 25th, Mexicans celebrate Nochebuena as a family, usually in the close and intimate confines of the home.  The celebration includes a large evening meal replete with traditional Mexican holiday foods and, in some homes, the North American favorite, a turkey, is served.  The exchange of gifts between family members also occurs on Nochebuena.  The following morning, Christmas Day, children in some states of Mexico receive gifts from either Santa Claus or the Holy Child, El Ni–o Dios.
<p>
<center><b>January 6 - Three Kings Day</b></center>
<p>
January 6th, the Feast of the Epiphany, or Three Kings Day (Dia de los Reyes), is the day of traditional gift-giving for children in the central and southern regions of Mexico.  Children flock to the plazas of the towns to have their pictures taken upon the laps of  boys dressed up as the Kings in long robes, crowns, and beards.  Parties are thrown which are known for the special cake with a tiny doll inside.  The individual who receives the piece including the figure must host the next party on Candlemas Day, February 2nd.
<p>
As Director General of Promotion for North America and Asia, Carlos Fernandez, explains, ÒThe variety that Mexico offers is the premier reason to visit Mexico at this sacred time of the year.  Supplementing this is the beautiful weather and the terrific value that Mexico offers American and Canadian tourists.Ó
<p>
As a result of the pesoÕs devaluation last December, travelers receive more pesos for their dollars, a holiday gift everyone can enjoy.  For more information, please call 1-800-44-MEXICO or visit the Mexico Ministry of TourismÕs website at http://mexico-travel.com/.

<center><h1>About this Health, Healing & Wellness site</h1></center></a>
Allopathic (western) medicine is well marketed:  its virtues are well publicized while its flaws rarely receive attention.  As practiced in the United States and other western nations, "medical science" is akin to a religion:  the faithful masses blindly entrust their health and lives to a belief system taken completely on faith; doctors are high priests whose words are seldom questioned by parishioners; pharmaceutical companies write the sacred texts from which the doctors read; the faith is evangelized to the "unenlightened".
<p> 
This site is an eclectic repository of information relating to Health and Healing drawn from many different systems of medical knowledge, including "western medicine".  We feel the value of "western medicine" has been over stated by those with commercial and political agendas, and that other systems of healing have not been given the credit they are due.  Reading the information herein may make you more critical of your current health care system and show you alternatives which may prove to be very beneficial.  Knowledge is power; we seek to empower individuals.
<p> <STRONG>Important:</STRONG>  The information you read herein is <STRONG>not</STRONG> professional medical advice nor is it tailored to your particular situation, condition or needs.  While we encourage individuals to take responsibility for their own health and well being, it is perfectly reasonable and prudent to seek professional advice when the situation is serious, you are unable to resolve the situation yourself, or you lack adequate information to make an informed decision.  The reader is further cautioned that the information and ideas herein may be controversial and scientifically unproven.  We encourage critical evaluation of any information relating to your health, and that includes the information contained in our repository as well as traditional medical dogma.  We cannot and do not assume responsibility for your health or well being.  
<p>
This database contains much interesting and eclectic information on topics related to Health, Healing and Medicine.  The intent of this database is to stimulate your thinking, expose you to new ideas and, hopefully, inspire you to regain control of your health.  
<p>
Since you are technologically able to read this online text, it is likely that your system of health care is based on allopathic medicine (Western Medicine).  While allopathic medicine has many achievements to be proud of, it is not as successful as we have been lead to believe.  It also fails to help millions of people.  The problems of allopathic medicine go far beyond the cost of the technology and the delivery of care.  Allopathic medicine simply fails to heal many people, and in many instances can actually cause harm, disease and death.  We shall examine the reasons for these failures and learn how to not become a victim of modern medicine.  We will also learn how to promote health.
<p>
We encourage everyone to take an active role in their own health care.  This means educating yourself in proper nutrition and healthy lifestyles to stay healthy and disease free.  If you have any ailments, it means understanding your illness and treatment options.  Whether or not you choose to consult a health care professional should depend upon the seriousness of your condition and your knowledge of the disease and treatment.  In other words, we are advocating common sense.  We are writers and editors, not health care professionals.  The information contained herein should not be construed as a medical prescription or advice.  The reason we say this is because each situation is different.  Though you may read about something which sounds very similar to your condition, there may be differences from your case.<img src="../zines/graphics/hyacinth.gif" align=right vspace=6 hspace=20 border=0>   It is perfectly reasonable and prudent to seek professional advice when the situation is serious or you are unable to resolve the situation yourself.  Delaying adequate treatment of a serious condition can cause permanent physical handicaps, including death.
<p>
The other side of this coin, however, is that certification by a government or an educational institution does not guarantee that the professional you seek advice from will be able to help you, or that they will not give you the wrong advice or cause you harm.  Official sanction of a particular medical paradigm does not make it true.  The best way to ensure this doesn't happen is to be as knowledgeable as you can yourself, ask lots of questions, and make an informed decision.
<p>
In this database, you will find information from the fields of allopathic medicine, naturopathic medicine, ayurvedic medicine, herbal medicine and more.  We will examine the psychological component of health and the mind-body link.  We will also examine the problems of various medical disciplines, especially allopathic medicine.  Our focus on the difficulties of western medicine is due to the fact that so many people blindly trust their lives and health to a system which has some serious flaws.

<p><center><h1>John Dobson of The Sidewalk Astronomers</h1></center>
John Dobson is a co-founder of The Sidewalk Astronomers, a pioneering builder of telescopes, and a teacher.  His theories in physics and cosmology boldly break new ground and significantly challenge the scientific orthodoxy.  John Dobson's scientific musings are very thought provoking and, like Einstein's Relativity, require us to re-examine our view of many things.
<p>
Like many scientists, Dobson is not a materialist.  He believes that it is a mistake, encouraged by our genetics, to view the Universe as material.  In his view, the Universe is apparitional.  He also makes convincing arguments against the existence of the photon (using Einstein's theory of relativity) and debunks the Big Bang theory.  In place of the Big Bang, Dobson presents a Steady State model which more accurately and more simply describes observed cosmological phenomena.
<p>
John Dobson, who recently celebrated his 80th birthday, is a man of humble means who finances his work by conducting Cosmology and Telescope Making classes.  His work is not supported by any large research organization.  This grassroots approach frees John from the scientific orthodoxy which handicaps many scientists today.  
<p>
<strong>Webmaster's note:</strong> Most of John's writings exist only in paper form and are not currently in computer readable form.  We are in the process of scanning and OCR'ing his writings, but this will take some time to complete.  We are working to bring them online as soon as possible.  This web site is constructed and maintained as a public service by MagicPubs at no cost to John Dobson or The Sidewalk Astronomers.

<center><h1>About The Sidewalk Astronomers</h1></center>
The Sidewalk Astronomers are a group of amateur astronomers who build telescopes and take them to public places beckoning passersby to come have a look at the heavens.  They do this with no profit motive in mind; it is purely for the satisfaction of sharing the wonders of the heavens with others.  If you want to know more about the The Sidewalk Astronomers, you may wish to visit their web sites: <a href="http://members.aol.com/raycash/sidewalk.htm" target="extern">San Francisco</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/6389/" target="extern">Los Angeles</a>.  On our site here, there are two papers by John Dobson, "<a href="WatchersOfSkies.html">Watchers of the Skies</a>" and "<a href="DeathValleyDeadStars.html">Dying Stars Viewed From Death Valley</a>", which will give you some insight into what motivated John to become involved with the Sidewalk Astronomers.

<center><h1>About John Dobson</h1></center>
John Dobson, co-founder of the Sidewalk Astronomers and builder of telescopes, is a groundbreaking thinker and teacher.  He was featured in the PBS television series "The Astronomers", has been written up several times in "Sky and Telescope" magazine, twice appeared on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, and has been interviewed many times for radio programs on stations such as Oregon Public Broadcasting.  His theories in physics and cosmology boldly break new ground and significantly challenge the scientific orthodoxy.  John Dobson is perhaps best known for his work in the design and construction of telescopes, however, as most telescopes made today use what is known as a "Dobsonian" mount. 
<p>
John Dobson's scientific musings are very thought provoking and, like Einstein's Relativity, require us to re-examine many of our long-held views.  While many leading scientists accept the Big Band model without question, Dobson does not.  After examining the theory, Dobson concluded it was fatally flawed and has been debunking the Big Bang ever since.  He predicts that the Big Bang will fall out of favor within this decade.  In place of the Big Bang, Dobson presents a Steady State model which more accurately describes observed cosmological phenomena.  His model does not suffer the flaws of its Steady State predecessors which were popular before the Big Bang theories.  The Dobson Steady State model is simple and elegant.  It is simpler than the various Big Bang theories and if we apply the Law of Parsimony (aka Occam's Razor), the Dobson model clearly wins due to its greater simplicity.
<p>
Like many scientists, Dobson is not a materialist.  He admits that our desire to view the world as made up of indestructible matter, tiny billiard balls at the subatomic level, is very strongly instilled in us.  But he believes that it is a mistake, encouraged by our genetics, to view the world this way.  In his view and words, the "Universe is apparitional."  For those familiar with the television series <cite>Star Trek:  The Next Generation, </cite> Dobson's view is that the Universe is similar to a holographic projection on the Holodeck.  Objects and people on the Holodeck are seemingly made of solid matter, but that is only an illusion.  It is important to note that Dobson himself does not make this Holodeck analogy; he watches very little television and is unfamiliar with the newer Star Trek series.
<p>
No brief biography of John Dobson would be complete without mentioning the fact that he spent 27 years in a Vedanta monastery.  Since leaving the monastery, he continues to live a spartan, unpretentious lifestyle.  He is compelled to share the beauty of the universe with others, expecting nothing in return save the joy of sharing, and does so by setting up telescopes in public places beckoning passersby to come look through the telescope, and by conducting classes and public lectures.

<center><h1>Complexifications</h1></center></a>
Is the apparent trend toward complexity in nature directed by a divinity, or an inevitable consequence inherent in the structure of the cosmos?  In this paper, John Dobson explains how this trend could be a natural process which does not require a divine hand, however in so doing he has laid the groundwork supporting the notion that the cosmos itself may be divine.  In this paper, Dobson discusses the apparitional nature of the universe, the creation of living organisms and ego, and genetic programming.

In this paper, John Dobson discusses the apparitional nature of the universe and why we are fooled into viewing it in a Newtonian-mechanistic way.  This paper is multidisciplinary and should be of interest to anyone interested in the subjects of anthropology, cosmology, genetic programming, relativity theory, sociology, quantum mechanics, or religion.  Of this paper, Dobson wrote the following abstract:
<blockquote>
Modern  cosmologists usually take non-existence for granted and hope to get the Universe out of nothing. But must we assume that in the absence of the Universe and  in the absence of space and time there would be nothing? Or can we, without so  rash an assumption, find clues  to what might remain if instead we take existence for granted but leave out space  and time? Could what remains, through apparition or "maya," appear  as this Universe? Can we, from what remains, get a Universe of gravity, electricity  and inertia?

This paper is John Dobson's response to a Questionnaire from the 1993 Parliament of Religions.  In it he discusses the origin of the universe, life, and homo sapiens.  He also discusses the relationship between religion and science.  Topics deal with cosmological, biological and philosophical issues:  Steady State vs. Big Bang theory, the Cosmic Expansion and the Background Radiation, the Origin of Life, Sentiency, Intelligence, Homo Sapiens, Tools, Language, Science and Religion.

In this paper John Dobson briefly discusses the nature of light.  He begins with a brief history of the scientific quest to understand light starting with Newton.  Dobson discusses why Einstein's relativity theory, in effect, says that photons do not exist.  He concludes by suggesting an anti-existentialist view of existence.  This paper is very brief and Dobson does not fully develop his ideas on the nature of photons nor his anti-existentialist views.

Science is searching for its soul; spirituality is seeking its intellect.  In ages past, each has delivered a lonely monolog.  At times, these two voices have been discordant.  Now both pursue what the other already offers.  This is the play unfolding on humanity's stage.   Quanta-Gaia is science, spirituality, and the cosmic unity embracing them both.

<a href="#TOC"><img src="../graphics/buttons/upToTOC.gif" align="right" border=0></a>
<center><h1>What is this site all about?  <br> What is Quanta-Gaia?</h1></center>
Welcome to Quanta-Gaia.  You are probably asking yourself:  What is Quanta-Gaia all about?  Well, i'm not sure there's a quick answer to that, but i know you are trying to quickly determine if this site is worthy of your time, so i will be as succinct as possible.  
<p>
This site is about science, it is about spirit and spirituality, it is about philosophy, and it is about how these are all inextricably tied together.  Now right away i have no doubt turned off some of you by mentioning the words "science", "spirituality", and "philosophy" all in the same sentence.  These disciplines have been at war long enough.  More can be learned by uniting them than by continuing the schism.  No doubt that the word "science" is the line of demarcation for most.  After all, it is not "scientific" to talk about spirit or soul, now is it?  And if you are into spirituality, philosophy, or perhaps even the paranormal, you probably take a jaundiced view of anyone talking about science -- those "ignorant", "negative", "skeptical" types.
<p>
Well it's time for this petty bickering to stop.  No matter which side of the fence you are on, there is something to be learned from the other side.  Each side is at an impasse, though neither side really sees it.  I came from the "science" side myself.  I used to deride the "nuts" on the other side.  But a funny thing happened to me on my scientifically self-righteous journey:  i stopped and listened to what science was telling me, and to my surprise it said:  "Hey bud, this world is a lot different than you think.  In fact, nothing is really what it seems."  I then realized that many of today's leading physicists were sounding like mystics, and like the shamans of certain "primitive" societies.
<p>
With this realization, i began to ask the bigger question:  What does this all mean?  And:  How did this come about?  This site is about shedding some light on those questions and coming up with a few answers.  It is partly about laying a scientific basis for spirituality, philosophy, and even the paranormal.  It is also about understanding what science really is, the role it currently plays in our society, and about tempering "scientific" fanaticism.  Not every paper of Quanta-Gaia deals with these issues directly, nor with science.  Some papers are included simply because they are consistent in their overall scope with Quanta-Gaia's ideology.  Examples of this are Mark Twain's essays, and some of the papers in the John Dobson site.
<p>
Science, Spirituality, Philosophy, and even the Paranormal are all complementary disciplines.  Unfortunately, there are charlatans in each who discredit their field.  The paranormal charlatans give it such bad press that i hesitate to even mention it, but i think that there are proportionately as many scientific charlatans in our society.  Unfortunately, the scientific charlatans are socially acceptable so they actually get good press rather than bad.  Being in positions of importance in our society, they may inflict greater social harm than the paranormal charlatans.  Every society has its witch doctors; ours is no different.
<p>
Quanta-Gaia, in summary, is a place where science and spirituality meet and play.  Science alone is not enough for humanity, but any spirituality in opposition to science is nearing the end of its life.  Quanta-Gaia is science, spirituality, and the cosmic wholeness which embraces them both.  It is where mind and matter blend -- where dreams become real and reality is but a dream.

<center><h1>What does "Quanta-Gaia" mean?</h1></center>
Quanta-Gaia's etymology is straightforward:  Quanta is from "Quantum Mechanics", a branch of physics dealing with subatomic particles.  Gaia -- also spelled Gaea -- is the Greek goddess of the earth.  In modern usage it refers to the "Gaia Hypothesis" -- the view of the Earth as a living organism.  Quanta-Gaia, while firmly rooted in science, is tempered by a holistic and spiritual view of the Earth and the Cosmos.  (Quanta-Gaia is pronounced:  kwon-tuh gay-uh.)

"The Journal of Small Business Technology" is an electronic newsletter devoted to addressing the problems faced by small businesses and folks with home offices, but much of it is also relevant to home computer users as well.  Many articles are about computers and software, but this newsletter also deals with issues beyond computers.  While the editors prefer the Macintosh, many articles apply to either the Mac or "Wintel" (Windows/Intel) platforms.
<p>
The editors invite your contributions to The Journal of Small Business Technology.  If you have information which may be of interest to our readers, suggestions for articles, are interested in writing an article, or have royalty free graphics, please send eMail to the editor.

<center><h1>About this Health, Healing & Wellness site</h1></center></a>
Allopathic (western) medicine is well marketed:  its virtues are well publicized while its flaws rarely receive attention.  As practiced in the United States and other western nations, "medical science" is akin to a religion:  the faithful masses blindly entrust their health and lives to a belief system taken completely on faith; doctors are high priests whose words are seldom questioned by parishioners; pharmaceutical companies write the sacred texts from which the doctors read; the faith is evangelized to the "unenlightened".
<p> 
This site is an eclectic repository of information relating to Health and Healing drawn from many different systems of medical knowledge, including "western medicine".  We feel the value of "western medicine" has been over stated by those with commercial and political agendas, and that other systems of healing have not been given the credit they are due.  Reading the information herein may make you more critical of your current health care system and show you alternatives which may prove to be very beneficial.  Knowledge is power; we seek to empower individuals.
<p> <STRONG>Important:</STRONG>  The information you read herein is <STRONG>not</STRONG> professional medical advice nor is it tailored to your particular situation, condition or needs.  While we encourage individuals to take responsibility for their own health and well being, it is perfectly reasonable and prudent to seek professional advice when the situation is serious, you are unable to resolve the situation yourself, or you lack adequate information to make an informed decision.  The reader is further cautioned that the information and ideas herein may be controversial and scientifically unproven.  We encourage critical evaluation of any information relating to your health, and that includes the information contained in our repository as well as traditional medical dogma.  We cannot and do not assume responsibility for your health or well being.  
<p>
This database contains much interesting and eclectic information on topics related to Health, Healing and Medicine.  The intent of this database is to stimulate your thinking, expose you to new ideas and, hopefully, inspire you to regain control of your health.  
<p>
Since you are technologically able to read this online text, it is likely that your system of health care is based on allopathic medicine (Western Medicine).  While allopathic medicine has many achievements to be proud of, it is not as successful as we have been lead to believe.  It also fails to help millions of people.  The problems of allopathic medicine go far beyond the cost of the technology and the delivery of care.  Allopathic medicine simply fails to heal many people, and in many instances can actually cause harm, disease and death.  We shall examine the reasons for these failures and learn how to not become a victim of modern medicine.  We will also learn how to promote health.
<p>
We encourage everyone to take an active role in their own health care.  This means educating yourself in proper nutrition and healthy lifestyles to stay healthy and disease free.  If you have any ailments, it means understanding your illness and treatment options.  Whether or not you choose to consult a health care professional should depend upon the seriousness of your condition and your knowledge of the disease and treatment.  In other words, we are advocating common sense.  We are writers and editors, not health care professionals.  The information contained herein should not be construed as a medical prescription or advice.  The reason we say this is because each situation is different.  Though you may read about something which sounds very similar to your condition, there may be differences from your case.<img src="../zines/graphics/hyacinth.gif" align=right vspace=6 hspace=20 border=0>   It is perfectly reasonable and prudent to seek professional advice when the situation is serious or you are unable to resolve the situation yourself.  Delaying adequate treatment of a serious condition can cause permanent physical handicaps, including death.
<p>
The other side of this coin, however, is that certification by a government or an educational institution does not guarantee that the professional you seek advice from will be able to help you, or that they will not give you the wrong advice or cause you harm.  Official sanction of a particular medical paradigm does not make it true.  The best way to ensure this doesn't happen is to be as knowledgeable as you can yourself, ask lots of questions, and make an informed decision.
<p>
In this database, you will find information from the fields of allopathic medicine, naturopathic medicine, ayurvedic medicine, herbal medicine and more.  We will examine the psychological component of health and the mind-body link.  We will also examine the problems of various medical disciplines, especially allopathic medicine.  Our focus on the difficulties of western medicine is due to the fact that so many people blindly trust their lives and health to a system which has some serious flaws.

<strong>by Sydney Stephenson</strong>
<p>

Just like a growing plant, the human body needs water to survive.  Lots of water.  
<p>
The concept is nothing new.  But one medical researcher has a new twist on  the idea that eight to 10 glasses of water each day helps keep the doctor away.
<p>
Iranian-born  Dr. Fereydoon  Batmanghelidj (pronounced Batman-gel-edge), says water not only keeps people  healthy, but when "prescribed" correctly, can cure common ailments  such as asthma, allergies, high cholesterol, hypertension, chronic fatigue syndrome,  morning sickness and ulcers.  Drinking two eight-ounce glasses of water  before each meal can also help people control their weight.
<p>
"People  know water is good for them but they don't know why," says Batmanghelidj,  of Falls Church, Virginia.  "People  don't know what happens to the body if it doesn't receive enough water.   Even doctors do not know enough about the critical role water plays in the  physiology of the human body."
<p>
Like the plant that begins to wilt  and eventually die without enough water, so too our bodies begin to severely dehydrate  for lack of moisture.
<p>
"If your body indicates that it's thirsty  by way of 'dry mouth'," you're already dehydrated," says Batmanghelidj.   The dehydration process  only becomes more severe as the body ages, he says, because people lose their  thirst sensation as they get older and stop drinking water -- yet the body still  needs liquid.
<p>
Why is water so important? According to Batmanghelidj,  water regulates all body functions.  Cells in the body need water to efficiently  transport proteins and enzymes to nerve endings.  But that's not all.  The flow  of water in the body also acts as an important adhesive material between cells  and transports sugars for energy.
<p>
When  there's not enough water in the body, a sort of water rationing  process kicks in, says Batmanghelidj.  The brain is first in line to receive  available water, followed by the kidney and liver.  After that, it's every organ  for itself.
<p>
"If there isn't enough water in the body, certain parts  such as the glands or joints become dehydrated," says Batmanghelidj.   "Those areas are then more susceptible to problems and that's how people get  arthritis or become injured."
<p>
For  example, in the case of an ulcer, excess acid has built up in  the lining of the stomach because there hasn't been enough water to flush the  acid out through the kidneys in the form of urine.  For asthmatics, a lack of water  in the body means less water evaporation into the lungs and breathing becomes  even more difficult.
<p>
Dr. Batmanghelidj, known simply as Dr. Batman to  his friends, received his medical training at London's St.  Mary's Hospital Medical  School.  After his education,  he returned to Iran to practice medicine, build hospitals and construct youth  sports facilities.
<p>
Batmanghelidj's first foray into the world of water  as a pain killer came during his incarceration as an Iranian political prisoner  after the fall of the shah in 1979.
<p>
"Late one night, a man suffering  from an untreated ulcer came to me with excruciating abdominal pain,"  remembers Batmanghelidj, who rarely talks about his days inside Iran's notorious  Evin prison.  "The man  had swallowed an entire bottle of antacid," to no avail.
<p>
After determining  that the man's ulcer had not caused an abdominal perforation, Batmanghelidj  gave the man two glasses of water -- the only "medicine" available  at the time, he says.
<p>
"Within 15 minutes the man's pain began to  recede," says Batmanghelidj.  "After drinking two glasses of water  every three hours for several days," the patient's abdominal pain permanently  subsided."
<p>
Batmanghelidj's  discovery proved to be his salvation.  By submitting an article on  the medical uses of water to a prison trial judge, he was able to successfully  defend 32 charges leveled against him.  Any single guilty verdict carried the death  penalty.  His life was spared and he was given a three-year sentence.  During  that time he was allowed to continue his research among the confines of the  prison.  In all, Batmanghelidj treated more than 3,000 people with ulcers.  He  also claims to have treated hypertension  and a number of other stress-related conditions, the prison being a  "most ideal stress laboratory."
<p>
Batmanghelidj's research into  water metabolism continued after his release from prison and his eventual escape  from Iran in 1982.  He's been advocating water as a cure to everyone from scientists  at international conferences where he's been a guest lecturer to neighbors  and friends.
<p>
"When I first started on [Dr. Batmanghelidj's] program  I was overweight with high  blood pressure and suffering from asthma and allergies," says Michael Peck  of Austin, Texas.
<p>
"Today I have my weight and blood pressure under  control.  The program reduced the frequency of asthma and allergy-related problems  to the point of practical nonexistence.  I also experienced fewer colds and  flus and generally with less severity."
<p>
Inspired by testimonials  such as these, Batmanghelidj recently compiled his clinical observations and research  into a book "Your  Body's Many Cries for Water," which details the problem of dehydration and  its impact on the body.  His theories have also been published in scholarly publications  like Anticancer Research and the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology.
<p>
"If  people begin to correct their water habits we could reduce health  care costs in the U.S.  by 50 percent," states Batmanghelidj.  "Hypertension  alone is a $100 billion disorder.  Back pain costs the nation $80  billion annually."
<p>
For  most ailments, water takes several days to take effect as the cells in the  body soak up water like a sponge, says Batmanghelidj.  Headaches, however, may  disappear in a few minutes after two glasses of water.  With water, arthritis  pain may subside in a few hours.
<p>
Most people who hear Batmanghelidj's ideas  immediately worry that they'll spend more time in the bathrooms.  But, he says,  the kidneys eventually get used to the extra water and visits to the restroom  are no more frequent than usual.
<p>
"It's  important to remember that coffee, tea, soda and alcohol  do not count as 'water' simply because they contain water," says Batmanghelidj.   "All of these products are diuretics and can actually encourage dehydration."
<p>
But  despite his confidence in the medical properties of  water, Batmanghelidj still recommends people continue to visit the family physician.
<p>
"A  doctor is needed to guide the individual," says Batmanghelidj.   "Not all diseases  can be cured by water such as infections and broken bones."
<p>
Doctors  themselves, however, have been slow to embrace Batmanghelidj's less-than-mainstream  theories.
<p>
"I know of no evidence that the average person  does not get enough water," says Dr. Walter Mertz, a medical doctor who specializes  in nutrition at the U.S.  Department of Agriculture.
<p>
While water  is the "second most important nutrient after oxygen," says Mertz,  "I have seen no evidence  that not drinking eight glasses of water each day has a significant harmful effect  on the health of the average American."
<p>
Such skepticism has been  difficult for Batmanghelidj to understand, particularly since the advice he's  giving -- and the treatment he's advocating -- come free.
<p>
"I have abandoned  tremendous personal fortune to bring this information to the West,"  he says with a shrug of indifference.  "I no longer wish anyone would come  to me and say 'here's this money'.   I have conducted my research and seen its results firsthand.  Now, I want  to share my knowledge with society." He is also looking for his research  to become widely accepted and utilized by physicians treating certain conditions.
<p>
Batmanghelidj's  research is currently being examined by medical researchers  at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  One of the groups interested  in his theories is housed in the Office of Alternative Medicine.  Joe Jacobs,  the office's director, calls  the water theory "intriguing in terms of the enhanced clinical benefit that  may be derived from drinking water." Jacobs would like to see Batmanghelidj  test the hypothesis further with other clinicians.
<p>
"The U.S.   medical community's reliance on the pharmaceutical industry amounts to large-scale  and egregious fraud and misinformation," says Batmanghelidj.  "The  exorbitant rise in the cost of this nation's health care makes it critical to  look for responsible options to  traditional health care practices."
<p>
Even though he may have to wait  for more Americans to take notice of his and other nontraditional medical research,  at least the 62-year old doctor has his health -- thanks, he says, to water.
<p>
"I  don't get sick," says Batmanghelidj.  "In the past  ten years, I've never had occasion to use the U.S.  health care system."
<p>
That's  something to drink a glass of water to.

Alternative and non-alternative medical practices can complement  each other.  At least that's the view of the National Institutes of Health  (NIH), which recently set up an "Office of Alternative Medicine" to  examine the merits of unorthodox research -- everything from homeopathy to hypnosis,  from acupuncture to ozone therapy.
<p>
For the consumer, alternative medicine  is already an effective route to recovery.  A study published last January  in the New England Journal of  Medicine found that as many as one in three Americans are trying alternative  remedies -- a total of $14 billion each year.
<p>
"Alternative practitioners  may be less invasive, cheaper, and they may take a more realistic approach  (to treatment)," says Dr. Joseph J.  Jacobs, the director of the NIH's new  office.  "Our job is to clarify how effective these treatments are."
<p>
One  of the most promising new alternative therapies, according to the  NIH, is shark cartilage.  Because  studies on sharks have demonstrated the ocean predator's natural resistance  to cancer, scientists may be able to use their cartilage to stunt tumor growth  in human cancer victims.
<p>
Other untried but apparently true therapies: Bee  pollen as a possible treatment for asthma and allergies; and ozone gas, which  if introduced into the bloodstream can help fight disease.
<p>
Jacobs, whose  mother was a full-blooded Mohawk and whose father was part Cherokee, is no stranger  to the world of alternative  healing.
<p>
He'll no doubt draw on that knowledge when making decisions  about how to distribute the office's $2 million budget.  One-quarter of the budget  will be doled out to "collaboration-minded" alternative medicine  researchers this month (September 30) in the form of small seed grants.
<p>
Pressure  to perform is hitting Jacobs from all corners.  As a result, Jacobs is  taking great care to insure that the office isn't pushed into any action without  some rational basis.
<p>
"I'm  turned off by the idea of cures immediately," says Jacobs.  "When  I hear that word, my defenses go up.  Our challenge is to get people in  the alternative medicine community away from the panacea notion and to be more  realistic about what they're trying to say."
<p>
Health policy watchers  say the efforts put forth by Jacobs' under the auspices of the NIH's new office  represent an ongoing paradigm shift in health care.  "In a couple of years,  the word alternative will  have a different meaning," notes Janet Smith, president of the National Wellness  Coalition, "because alternative [medicine] is becoming mainstream."

<center> <h2>New Ideas on AIDS</h2> </center>
<p>
In this section,  I am sharing with you the result of many years of my own research into the physiological  reasons and relationships of AIDS to metabolism disturbance that can  be caused by severe emotional  and physical stress. I hold the idea that the AIDS is not a viral disease, but  is a metabolic disorder precipitated by an exaggerated way of life. It can equally  be caused by severe malnutrition in poorer and famine stricken societies. I  <cite>know this view is completely against the current beliefs forced by media  presentation of a social problem, but it is the responsibility of dedicated scientists  to take into consideration and explore all aspects to this problem. </cite>&nbsp;We  are only now beginning  to understand what AIDS may be. We know one thing it is not, a virus produced disease!   At the end of this section, you will be introduced to some of the unfolding  events around AIDS research. I will also show you that I have been in the  middle of the controversy.
<p>
At this point, and through the perspective of a  stress-induced metabolic system disturbance, a more accurate understanding of AIDS  may also become possible. We should not close our eyes to new information just  because we are sold the idea  that this condition is caused by a class of viruses conveniently called HIV.
<p>
For  some time now it has been scientifically shown and recognized that those  suffering from AIDS demonstrate a marked variation in the amino acid pool of their  body. <cite>They are consistently and drastically short of methionine, cystine  and cysteine--very important amino acids. They also have a manyfold rise in  the levels of arginine and glutamate. </cite>&nbsp;This state of a very drastic amino  acid imbalance seems to last  for some time before the patient becomes very sick. It seems in clinically obvious  and recognizable AIDS suffering people, this pattern for amino acid composition  of the body is dominant. In the section on tryptophan, it was explained that  the amino acid pool composition of the body can change and become depleted if  some of them are used up more than others.
<p>
In a series of other experiments,  when IL-6 and another similar substance (TNF -tumor necrosis factor) are added  to a cell culture medium that  contains cells with the ability to produce the virus, particles labeled HIV are extruded. If before the addition of IL-6 or TNF cysteine is added to the same  culture medium, the HIV particles are not produced. Thus, there is a direct correlation  between HIV production in AIDS and amino acid content of the virus growing  cell. It seems on the face of it that AIDS patients are a victim of an imbalance  in their bodies' amino acid composition. If they could correct their protein metabolism, they might be  able to survive and their bodies might be able to produce sufficient resistance  to fight other acute infections. After all, even for the manufacture of antibodies to other bacteria, the body needs the basic amino acid ingredients in their  correct proportions.
<p>
It is unfortunate that we are looking at the virus  and not seeing the physiological imbalance in AIDS patients. It is also unfortunate  that we do not understand the subordinate metabolic roles of IL-6 to cortisone-releasing  mechanism and IL-1  production. These agents, and others in their pack, are produced to mobilize  the primary raw materials from body reserves to fight stress and repair the possible  damages caused by having confronted any particular stressor. Their function  is designed around the mechanism of breaking down proteins held in the muscles  of the body and converting them to their basic amino acids for their use in  the liver. So, the general direction in severe stress-damage is to mobilize the  essential ingredients for emergency  re-use--a process of feeding off the body itself.
<p>
A bruised boxer or a  person traumatized in an accident or after repeated surgery will depend on these  physiological processes to clear the ineffective and nonviable tissue and repair  and remodel the site of damage. If the reconstruction is extensive and IL-6  and its companion TNF are involved, breakdown of DNA or RNA of the damaged and  dying cells will produce exact fragments to clear the debris, very much like  having to dismember the steel structure  of a large building that can not be "bulldozed away" and has to be carried  off the site a piece at a time. This is a recognized process in the research  of surgical wound.
<p>
It is most unfortunate that virologists are presenting  the "site clearance action" of these two agents in the body as steps in the production  of HIV in cell culture media. On this fragment of unconnected information  is placed the whole argument that AIDS is a virus-caused disease. Why? Because  a test has been designed that  marks and shows the particular fragments produced by IL-6 or TNF. It seems that  some of these DNA or RNA particles are labeled as HIV--and that is why there  are several types. It is more unfortunate that the amino acid composition of HIV  itself very much resembles that of <cite>vasopressin. </cite>&nbsp;A vaccine that  would arrest the HIV activity will most probably arrest the activity of vasopressin.  This reason seems to be why a workable vaccine against HIV has not yet been  produced. Unfortunate to the  extreme is the "commercialization of the idea" that everyone that shows positive  HIV test will soon die from AIDS, whereas <cite>the anxiety of having an incurable  disease could become a killer by itself.</cite>&nbsp;
<p>
Without  getting into the emotional side of this issue, and sticking strictly to a scientific  understanding of the human body, we have to become aware of a simple fact.  The tissues of the vagina and the anus and rectum are designed for different  purposes. It is true both have  a similar sensory systems attached to a single central mechanism for the registration  of pain and pleasure, but structurally they are not the same. The vagina  has a thick multilayered cell lining that, while not easily absorbing the semen  from inside, is designed to withstand friction and sheering force. Even here,  there is a mechanism for secretion of lubricating mucus to withstand these forces.  Furthermore, semen has chemical properties that will increase the thickness  and resistance of the lining  membrane in the vagina.
<p>
The seminal fluid secreted with the sperms is a very  complex composition. It contains a chemical substance called <cite>trans-glutamin-ase  </cite>&nbsp;(TGE). In certain circumstances, TGE binds some proteins to other  proteins. It also causes some cells to die in a special way--to shrivel and not  disintegrate, thus its power to produce a thickening of the vaginal wall to cope  with normal male-female sex relationships. The semen also contains proteins  with extremely strong immune suppressive  properties.
<p>
It is the immune suppressive property of semen that will  facilitate the passage of sperm all the way up into the uterus and its tubes  to fertilize the female egg. To the body, the millions of sperms that enter the  uterus are the invading foreign "objects" and highly reactionary for the uterine  wall and its tubes, had they not been protected by the immune repressive properties  of proteins from the semen that bathe the sperms. To survive during nine  months of pregnancy, the sperm  that has different antigenic properties to the mother's tissue, the mother's  immune system has to be suppressed for the duration. It seems that something  in the semen (possibly a uteroglobin-like protein that is called SV-IV) <cite>codes  for the mother's immune suppression. </cite>&nbsp;It is this immune-suppressive  property of semen that ensures the survival of initially the sperm, and ultimately  the fetus during full-term pregnancy until the production of a living offspring.
<p>
The  semen in the female  vagina is not absorbed. Because of the anatomical design and position of the  vagina, the semen is drained. On the other hand, the rectum is lined with very  thin and delicate cells. In the rectum, the semen is retained and its extremely  potent physiological properties are allowed freedom of action. Within the constituents  of semen, there are substances that are designed to over take the host's  immune system and force them to shut down the same way that a radar jamming  device is used on board warplanes  to enter the enemy air-space and deliver their bombs. Thus, semen has independent  ability to shut down the immune system of its host tissue if its agents are  allowed entry into the recipient's system.
<p>
<cite>With repeated secretion  of semen into a male or a female rectum, immune system suppression is unavoidable--not  because of a "virus," but because of the chemical properties of the semen  itself. Women, who participate in anal sex to avoid becoming pregnant, should  be aware of this  immune suppressive property of semen.</cite>&nbsp;
<p>
In addition to all  of the above, the intestinal wall is not capable of withstanding the forces involved  in rectal manipulation for sexual purposes. The reason why such sexual manipulations  become possible is because of one single fact: The intestinal tract  does not have an acute pain sensory system if damaged from inside and without  the damage affecting the peritoneum. Peritoneum is the thin outside cover of the  gastrointestinal tract. It is  amply supplied with nerves that will register pain. It is a type of "non-adhesive"  that permits the various segments of the intestinal tract to glide over one  another in their movements and adaptation to the passage of food. The rectum  is not completely covered by peritoneum.
<p>
Thus, the inside lining of the rectum  can become damaged from being pumped against, or otherwise manipulated, without  registering the damage in the same way the skin would sound the alarm when  its resistance is broken. The  rectum is the end part of an anatomical structure whose activity has to be performed  silently. However, this does not mean the damage is not recognized physiologically,  and it does not mean the physiological steps for repair of the local  damage will be less vigorous.
<p>
As part and parcel of the repair mechanisms,  the chemical agents TNF, IL-l, IL-6, and others in their pack will be secreted  to commence the process of crisis management. If the damage is such that the resident  bacteria could also break  barriers and begin increased local activity, the production of these agents for  crisis management will increase. (It has been shown experimentally that AIDS  patients have markedly increased levels of IL-6 and TNF in their blood.)
<p>
These  agents function very much like a team of specialist salvage workers that go  to a site after an earthquake. One group would clear the debris, others would  bring survival supplies for those caught in the area who cannot be relocated; another  would begin to restore power,  water, and telephone services, and so on. In the everyday life of a city,  all these processes take place, and they are carried out by people and machines.  In the human body, the same processes take place and the agents that perform  these necessary functions are hormones and their subordinate enzyme systems. The  principle is the same. Each cell has a personality and needs to survive on the  spot if it can be repaired. Only the dead or irreparably damaged cells will  have to be dismembered and cleared  away.
<p>
In rectal manipulation, should there be more than routine wear and  tear, these same agents become operatives for its repair. It will take time to  reproduce the original "blueprint" and fully restore the local tissues. Should  there be a recurrence of the injury, on top of a tissue that is already weak,  more forceful presence of these local repair agents will be called for. There may  come a time that these hormones and their subordinate operators will be <cite>permanently  </cite>&nbsp;commissioned  and their presence in the blood circulation will become measurable. Since the  relationship and significance of their increased presence for the repair of the  "unsensed" local damage in the rectum is not appreciated--and furthermore, the  rationale of their activity not recognized--part of their mechanism of function  is highlighted and labeled as the causative factor for the physiological upheaval  that is conveniently labeled as "AIDS" for public consumption.
<p>
In laboratory  research, it has been shown  that cysteine will vent the production of HIV in cultured cells. In other laboratory  research, it has been shown that AIDS patients are short of cysteine and  its precursor cystine. In two simple-to-understand experiments, a metabolic  basis to the development of the disease has been clearly demonstrated. If the cells  that are sufficiently abnormal to produce HIV are given <cite>cysteine, </cite>&nbsp;their  abnormality is corrected and they do not produce the HIV. All we needed  to know now is how did these  AIDS patients become cysteine-deficient? We should commence the research of this  phenomenon and not sidetrack AIDS research into a dead end by making a jump  of faith and assuming it to be virus produced.
<p>
In my opinion, it seems the  "HIV test" highlights the presence of a fragment of DNA or RNA of a damaged cell--it  indicates a process of cell nucleus breakdown. It could be produced by many  other factors, one of them <cite>cysteine and zinc </cite>&nbsp;deficiency, particularly  in underdeveloped and poorer  countries. It is also possible that it is caused as a result of persistent  and increasingly severe local damage in the rectum, producing a long-term run on  the body's protein reserves. This test by itself is not an accurate indicator  of the presence of an agent that causes the disease. <cite>The HIV itself produced  by a more severe imbalance in the make up of the amino acid pool of the body.  It is this devastating amino acid pool imbalance that kills the patients, and  not the HIV particle.</cite>&nbsp;
<p>
As  soon as this statement is made, many questions will pop up in the minds  of people who have been made to focus on HIV spread through blood. It <cite>is  true the blood may contain the released HIV particle; however, this blood also  contains many other hormones and transmitters-- Some not yet even known. One cannot  assume AIDS to be caused by HIV unless the physiological effects of the various  components in the serum or blood are known.</cite>&nbsp;
<p>
In  a series of very significant  experiments, scientists Brodish and Lymangrove(1) have shown that "stressed  intestines" produce a local hormone that has a very strong and long-lasting  activity. It acts as a very potent cortisone-releasing agent. This hormone could  be transfused in serum from one animal to another. It stays in the new animal  for some time and has exactly the same cortisone-releasing activity.
<p>
Cortisone  release mechanisms, at certain levels, will result in the production of some  nucleus breakdown and similar  DNA fragmentation to HIV particle formation. Again, this is a metabolic disorder  even if the tests are perceived to represent HIV particles formation.
<p>
We  should remember, all manufacturing processes in the cells of the body are taking  place in a fluid medium, parts can float away unless an anchoring system is  in place: A very important point that needs clarification is the fact that many  units of cysteine are involved in the formation of a type of anchoring "rope"  that has at some specific points  <cite>zinc hooks </cite>&nbsp;attached to a number of cysteines that keep DNA assembly  line in position and prevents the drift of its segments. The sex hormone receptor's  structure, formation, and function in men and women depend very strongly  on the presence of this zinc and cysteine "fingers." Thus, the deficiency of  cysteine in the body of those with AIDS could have a far greater significance  than may be apparent at first. Could the loss of sexual dominance in either sex  be initially caused by changes  in the amino acid pool composition of the body, with <cite>"comparative"</cite>&nbsp;  cysteine, and possibly zinc, deficiency at the top of the list? I personally  think this to be a strong possibility.
<p>
Another question that might be asked  is the relationship of intravenous morphine and heroin use to the production of  AIDS. The answer may possibly be found in the chemical properties of these substances  on body physiology. Morphine-like substances register their effect through  the nerve system, which sends  messages around by the use of serotonin as its neurotransmitter agent. This  nerve system and morphine-like substances are able to alter the metabolic pattern  of the body. Endorphins, the natural morphines of the body, not only suppress  the pain sensation and produce euphoria, they also alter the level of hunger  sensation. People who use morphine and heroin lose their appetite and do not seem  to eat properly.
<p>
Furthermore, those who use these drugs on a regular basis  are highly stressed people, either  by the initial reason that forced them to take drugs, or by the difficulty  of getting a regular supply. In any event, the stress physiology sets in, and  because of altered metabolism, not enough of the body's daily needs will be available.  When morphine or heroin is used, the sensations of hunger and thirst are  also suppressed and the body begins to feed off itself. In countries where people  used to smoke opium, a great number of these people eventually died of lung  infections--exactly what is <cite>now  blamed on the virus and contaminated needles.</cite>&nbsp;
<p>
It  is also important to know that there is a time gap of many years between the  recognition of HIV in the body and the production of clinical symptoms of immune  suppression. I <cite>can assure you, the amino acid imbalance during this time  gap becomes a far more potent killer than the "virus of AIDS." </cite>&nbsp;At the  beginning, the body begins to produce antibodies to the virus. It is only after  some time that the production  of all antibodies becomes insufficient and ineffective. <cite>We should not forget  that a balanced and well-pro portioned amino acid pool composition in the body  is absolutely essential for antibody production.</cite>&nbsp;
<p>
One  terrible aspect of AIDS is the cruelty with which it affects babies born to mothers  who are HIV positive. It should be clear, if the mother is deficient in certain  amino acids in her body, she is not able to provide the baby with the correct  range of amino acids for  its normal development. Should the mother be even minimally deficient in her methionine,  cystine, cysteine, tryptophan and others, the baby is bound to be short  of these same elements that will possibly predispose to DNA fragmentation in  the process of cell development, particularly in the breast feeding phase of the  child's development.
<p> <br>
<center> <h2>The Unfolding of Events in AIDS Research</h2> </center>
<p>
As  this book is being written, a group of scientists in AIDS research from Europe  and America are gathering in  Holland in May of 1992 to begin a movement against the established and protected  thinking on AIDS as a viral disease. As reported in the <cite>London Sunday  Times </cite>&nbsp;of 26-April-1992, two of the most interesting members of this group  will be Professor Luc Montagnier from France and Professor Duesberg from America.
<p>
Professor  Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute is the original discoverer  of the virus that was later labeled as HIV. This French professor isolated  the claimed virus that was supposed  to have inhibited the immune system. He sent samples of the virus to Robert  Gallo in America, who was also working on a method for isolation and testing  of an AIDS virus in the body. Dr. Gallo later applied for a patent on a test  kit. The French government started legal proceedings to claim its rights for the  discovery of the virus. Eventually and after much legal hassle, the two parties  agreed to share a portion of the proceeds from the marketing of the test kit.  The rest of the proceeds go to  further research of AIDS.
<p>
Professor Montagnier seems to have reversed his  original views and now claims the virus not to be of primary importance in AIDS.  The newspaper interview indicates that the Professor now accepts the possibility  of AIDS having other causes. He seems to acknowledge the possible existence  of AIDS even without the presence of HIV. The Professor must have come across  compelling arguments that deny HIV as he culprit and the single cause of all the  group of diseases classified  under AIDS. A drastic change has taken place in Professor Montagnier's thinking.
<p>
Professor  Duesberg, who had researched the actual composition of the virus--at  the same time as others were believing in its disease producing properties,  had announced the virus incapable of causing AIDS. There were many debates, but  his arguments did not cut any ice with the established group busy with AIDS viral  research in America and in Europe. He could not offer an alternative scientific  explanation on the etiology  of the diseases grouped together under AIDS other than saying the disease is  not caused by a virus. The researchers in this field were looking for plausible  scientific ideas to find a solution to the problem. A statement to the effect  that AIDS is not a viral disease was not enough. Scientific reasons to point in  another direction should have accompanied the negation of HIV as the cause of  the disease.
<p>
I wrote to Dr. Manfred Eigen, a most eminent DNA research scientist  from Max-Planck Institute  in Germany, on 25 September 1989, and in defense of Duesberg sent him two of my  articles presenting most of the views that were published in the Foundation's  Special AIDS Issue. Dr. Eigen had published an account of discussions between  AIDS virus advocates and Duesberg in <cite>Natur Weissenschafen. </cite>&nbsp;It seems  Dr. Eigen was not convinced by professor Duesberg's views and had taken the side  of the opposition. A few months later, Dr. Eigen sent me a letter that showed  he now realized another plausible  scientific view on the cause of AIDS does exist.
<p>
Now, all of a sudden  in 1992, a new surge of activity with an alternative view of AIDS seems to gather  momentum with both Professors Montagnier and Duesberg as the leaders in the  field.
<p>
In 1989, I had sent these researchers a copy of our Special AIDS Issue  of <cite>Science In Medicine Simplified (SMS) </cite>&nbsp;from the Foundation for  the Simple in Medicine (references 74 and 75), in the same way the Foundation freely  shares its views with most  top researchers (a copy of the letter to Manfred Eigen was also sent to Professor  Duesberg). This special AIDS volume was also sent to many medical libraries  at universities engaged in AIDS research. The detailed articles in this volume  presented scientific explanations from which a synopsis has been given in the  preceding paragraphs.
<p>
In my article on the neurotransmitter histamine, first  presented briefly at the 3rd Interscience World Conference on Inflammation in  1989, and later published in 1990,  I also explained the immune suppressive actions of many of the chemical agents  that are generated as a result of stress in the human body. In this extensively  distributed article, I discussed some aspects of AIDS as a severe stress-induced  "system disturbance," opposing the current view that it is caused by a  single virus.
<p>
This issue of <cite>SMS </cite>&nbsp;was also extensively distributed.  Copies of the 1989 Special AIDS Issue and 1990 issue of <cite>SMS </cite>&nbsp;were  also sent to Professor Philippe  Lazar, the Director General of <cite>INSERM </cite>&nbsp;in France. INSERM is the  French equivalent of NIH in America. He was asked to make the information contained  in these issues of <cite>SMS </cite>&nbsp;available to other interested scientists  at INSERM.
<p>
As my research was progressing, at the same time as new information  on the critical roles of cysteine in the manufacture of some DNA materials  became available and published, it now became completely clear and obvious to  me that AIDS was a metabolic disorder,  and the DNA/RNA fragments classified as the different viruses of AIDS  were themselves a product of cysteine shortage in the body. With infinitely more  detail than has been presented in this section, my most recent article, "AIDS:  The Dead-End of Virus Etiology" was published in the 1991 issue of <cite>SMS  </cite>&nbsp;and distributed to many other scientists engaged in this field of research.
<p>
It  is a moral obligation of any dedicated scientist to share his or her  new information with others engaged  in the research of a common topic, even before the subject is presented in  scientific journals. It is also a moral obligation of those who receive the information  to give credit to the person who has generated and shared the information.
<p>
A  news headline in <cite>Le Monde </cite>&nbsp;of 9-August-1991 reflected a  heated fight between Bruno Durieux, the Minister of Health of France and Professor  Albert German, President of the National Academy of Pharmacy of France. The  Minister had demanded the dismissal  of the good Professor. The Professor, in one of his addresses, had given  the opinion that AIDS is caused as a result of a particular life style. The opinion  of the Professor had become a hot issue for debate among the different social  groups. For this reason, the Professor had incurred the wrath of the Minister  and caused the demand for his dismissal. No occasion lends itself better to  the introduction of an explosive opinion than adding it as fuel to an already established  quarrel. The letter  printed in the next page was sent to M. Bruno Durieux, the Minister of Health of  France, with a copy to Professor German (see page 120).
<p>
I sincerely hope that  the free sharing of my researched views on AIDS has in some way been instrumental  in getting others to think about the relationship of this disease condition  with an abnormal physiology that becomes ultimately established as a result  of "stresses associated with a particular lifestyle," or "severe malnutrition  in less fortunate societies." The  children in Romania that were the subject of many television programs most probably  did not get AIDS from blood contamination, they more than likely developed  AIDS as a result of malnutrition.
<p>
Another point that needs to be discussed  is the value of the AIDS test as an indicator of a disease in the process of  development. This is what everyone is led to believe. This in my opinion is an  erroneous representation of a different truth. All this test shows is that the  body has come across this antigenic  particle and has registered its structure. It also means that the body has  kept the existence of this particle/virus in its memory-bank to manufacture a  defense mechanism against the "foreign particle," not necessarily a particle from  outside, but a particle that the body itself should not make--a form of quality  control at the "DNA assembly line." This test is ultimately an indicator of  a body's amino acid metabolism disturbance, and not an indicator of a loose killer virus in the body.
<p>
It has  been shown in laboratory experiments that if cysteine is added to a culture  medium that is growing cells for virus production, these cells will not manufacture  the "virus." In a medium with sufficient cysteine, it will not be possible  to harvest the virus. This test presents the most clear conclusion that the AIDS  test is only an indicator of an on-going amino acid imbalance in the body. It  is important to remember that if one amino acid in the body is not enough, then  a drastic imbalance in the percentage  composition of the other amino acids also exists.
<p>
These new ideas  on AIDS are presented to the readers of this book to indicate that a metabolic  approach to dealing with this social problem will produce more satisfactory and  quicker results. An easy way to stop muscle breakdown is by an intelligent adjustment  to the daily water intake and eating a balanced high protein diet. Enhancing  daily exercise and physical activity at the same time would force the body  into a physiological program  to build up its muscles, instead of breaking them into their amino acid components  to feed the rest of the body. You also need to realize the human body is designed  to defend itself against all types of infections. It survived fast acting  viruses such as small pox, measles, polio, and others during its development.  It generally takes the body about nine days to mount an effective defense against  even fast viruses. If the body can survive fast viruses, surely it is more  than capable of defending itself  against slowly growing viruses.
<p>
All that we need to understand is how to make  the body stronger and stop actions that would make it vulnerable.
<p>
Let us  remember, if the camel had a back breaking-point to the weight of the last straw,  surely the human body must also have a breaking-point to being life-stylishly  overloaded. The question is, do we continue to measure the straw or the inherent  structural and physiological limitations? Do we pay attention to the limitations  of the body, or do we in  carefree abandon blame an ineffective slow virus for the ills that befall some  members of our society?

<strong>by Gary Null </strong>

<p>
For more than a decade now, we've been told that the human immunodeficiency virus  causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which in turn causes death. Those in  the scientific community who have questioned this dogma -- the three-part equation  of HIV = AIDS = death -- have been suppressed. But they will be heard. In the war  on AIDS, it's only a matter of time.
<p>
The AIDS issue may well become America's Vietnam of the 90s. Think back to the  mid-60s, if you're old enough. You'll remember that as the United States got  increasingly involved in the Vietnam War, the government was adamant about the  correctness of its official line: We had to fight Communism in Southeast Asia  because if we didn't, the world's nations would fall like dominoes under Soviet  sway. The war was in our national interest. The war was winnable. Along with  these constantly repeated "facts" came the denigration of anyone who looked at  things differently, anyone who had the temerity to question or protest what  administration officials were telling us.
<p>
Fast forward about 30 years. One of the chief architects of America's Vietnam  involvement, ex-Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, has revealed that he and  other top administration officials, including President Johnson, had their doubts  about the official doctrines relatively early into the war. But nobody said  anything publicly. Nor did they admit that the protesters might have a point. On the contrary, they continued to vilify them. The administrators had already  invested so much in their flawed policy that they'd lose face by admitting that  their assumptions had been wrong. So they simply continued having Americans march  headlong into the Vietnam quagmire for years, at a devastating cost in American  and Asian lives, suffering, and expense. Ultimately, of course, there was the  expense of governmental credibility, as well.
<p>
It's almost uncanny how the AIDS war parallels our Vietnam experience. In this  case, it's not a matter of whether we should be engaged in the fight, but of  whether our underlying assumptions about the cause of AIDS, and our approach to  it, are correct. Increasingly today, members of the scientific community give us  reasons to challenge these assumptions. So one can't help but wonder, this time,  is it going to take decades before the protesters' valid points are acknowledged?  Or will those in power, this time, have the courage to come out and publicly  admit where they've been wrong? <h3>The AIDS Dogma and Its Problems</h3> <p>Since 1984, the mainstream media have been giving us only one side of the AIDS  story -- the officially approved side. When Dr. Robert Gallo and then Secretary of  Health Margaret Heckler announced that the probable cause of AIDS had been  discovered, H.I.V. became the sole cause of AIDS and the case was closed.  "Overnight, the word 'probable' ceased to exist and it became dogma... engraved  in stone," says investigative journalist John Lauritsen.
<p>
From that time on, a campaign has been conducted to program us into believing  that the human immunodeficiency virus is a deadly, infectious virus that  inevitably results in AIDS, and death. And we have been continually told that  while no cure exists, antiviral drugs, including A.Z.T., D.D.I., and D.D.C., will  slow down the progression of the disease. Despite evidence to the contrary, the  general public continues to buy these ideas. They are the only ones reported.
<p>
The fact is, there have always been people questioning or disagreeing with the official theory and treatment approach, but they have been silenced. Early on, the theory was challenged by a world-renowned retrovirologist, Peter Duesberg, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of California at Berkeley; and by Nobel Prize-winning scientist Walter Gilbert. But instead of  being urged on in their attempt to help mankind, they were ridiculed and their  funding was stopped.
<p>
The resistance to new evidence and exploration continues. Just last year, I  sponsored a conference featuring 100 AIDS survivors who beat the odds using  alternative therapies. Although press releases were issued on three occasions,  not a single member of the mainstream media attended. Similarly, Professor  Charles Geshekter, who was chair of the history of science for the American  Association for the Advancement of Science, Pacific Division, was thwarted by  elements in the A.A.A.S. in his efforts to organize a symposium to discuss  problems with the H.I.V.-equals-AIDS hypothesis.
<p>
Others report comparable experiences. Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D., former  clinical director of Kingsboro Psychiatric Center, in Brooklyn, New York, reports  that in June 1991, a committee of 40 scientists sent a simple letter to the five  leading scientific publications in the English-speaking world. The letter said,  basically, that the H.I.V.-equals-AIDS hypothesis wasn't getting anywhere, and  suggested that other avenues be explored. Says Lehrman, "None of these five  leading scientific publications -- <cite>Nature, Science, The Journal of the American  Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine,</cite>&nbsp; and <cite>The  Lancet</cite>&nbsp; -- would even publish this letter. This is called suppression."
<p>
Frank Buianouckas, Ph.D., believes outspoken scientists are scapegoated as a  warning to others in the science world, where the threat of losing grants always  looms as a very real possibility. "Look what happened to one of the great  scientific geniuses, Peter Duesberg," Buianouckas says. "What has he gained from  his courageous stand? I think lesser scientists see that and will keep their  mouths shut."
<p>
Nonetheless, a lot is happening behind the scenes. Journalist Neville  Hodgkinson writes in <cite>The Sunday Times</cite>&nbsp; of London that challengers of the  original hypothesis are growing in number because after 11 years of work on  H.I.V., AIDS researchers have failed to show how the virus could be doing the  damage attributed to it. The link between H.I.V. and AIDS is not as close as once  believed, and doomsday predictions about its spread have collapsed.
<p>
At the same time, the orthodoxy holds to its original beliefs more strongly  than ever, and continues to belittle the opposition. Their credibility is at  stake. As biochemist Charles A. Thomas, Jr., Nobel Prize-winning chemist  Kary B. Mullis, and law professor Phillip E. Johnson write, "If the theory is  mistaken, billions of dollars have been wasted -- and immense harm has been done to  persons who have tested positive for antibodies to H.I.V., and therefore have  been told to expect an early and painful death.

<h3>What's Wrong With H.I.V. Equals AIDS?</h3>
<p>
"In a nutshell, the idea of AIDS is a phony construct," states Lauritsen. "It  ties together 29 old diseases along with the presumption of H.I.V. infection.... This is not caused by H.I.V., the retrovirus."
<p>
"As applied, the H.I.V. theory is ... useless as a medical hypothesis,"  asserts Mullis, winner of the 1993 Nobel prize in chemistry for inventing the  polymerase-chain-reaction test for detecting the human immunodeficiency virus.
<p>
"I am well convinced that H.I.V. is harmless," states Dr. Fabio Franchi, a  specialist in infectious diseases and preventive medicine.
<p>
Why do these scientists and hundreds of others doubt the official story on AIDS? Thomas, Mullis, and Johnson offer three reasons:
<p>
"First, after spending billions of dollars, H.I.V. researchers are still  unable to explain how H.I.V., a conventional retrovirus with a very simple  genetic organization, damages the immune system, much less how to stop it. The  present stalemate contrasts dramatically with the confidence expressed in 1984.  At that time Gallo thought the virus killed cells directly by infecting them, and  the U.S. government officials predicted a vaccine would be available in two  years. [Eleven] years later, no vaccine is in sight, and the certainty about how  the virus destroys the immune system has dissolved in confusion.
<p>
"Second, in the absence of any agreement about how H.I.V. causes AIDS, the  only evidence that H.I.V. does cause AIDS is correlation. The correlation is  imperfect at best, however. There are many cases of persons with all the symptoms  of AIDS who do not have any H.I.V. infection. There are also many cases of  persons who have been infected by H.I.V. for more than a decade and show no signs  of illness.
<p>
"Third, predictions based on the H.I.V. theory have failed spectacularly.  AIDS in the United States and Europe has not spread through the general  population. Rather, it remains almost entirely confined to the original risk  groups -- mainly sexually promiscuous gay men and drug abusers. The [rate] of  H.I.V.-infected Americans has [increased more slowly] instead of increasing  rapidly as predicted, which suggests that H.I.V. is an old virus that has been  with us for centuries without causing an epidemic."
<p>
You wouldn't know it from the mainstream media, but the H.I.V. virus has  proven to be a weak one. As Duesberg explains, "Most viruses kill cells, but  certainly not the so-called AIDS virus. It rarely infects even one cell, and  even if it is in a cell, that cell doesn't die. One in a thousand cells, at most,  is infected. If you infect one in a thousand cells with a virus that doesn't kill  it in the first place, you cannot explain a fatal disease, namely AIDS, or a  collection of fatal diseases that is said to be due to the complete loss of T  cells."
<p>
The immune system appears to respond to H.I.V. in a typical fashion.  Initially, a newly infected person will experience mild flu-like symptoms. Then  the immune system will attack the virus and reduce its numbers to insignificant  amounts. If H.I.V. destroys the immune system, argue Thomas, Mullis, and Johnson,  it must do so years later, after the immune system has already destroyed the  virus.
<p>
But a long latency period is not possible, according to Duesberg. He argues  that if H.I.V. were deadly, it would attack immunity right away. "We have an  encyclopedic knowledge of retroviruses accumulated in the last 20 or 30 years.  We know about hundreds and thousands of them, better than any other type of  virus. And not one of them does that.
<p>
"When you contract any virus," Duesberg continues, "like measles from your  friend or your sister or brother, or herpes from a sexual contact, within a  week, or two or three at the latest, you will have caught it from that  contact.... The first cell gets infected. Then the infection spreads a day later  to a hundred cells, then to a hundred times a hundred cells, and so on. Within a  week or two, you either get infected and get a disease, or you reject it and  don't get one. At no time do you get infected today and then ten years later get  dementia, diarrhea, Kaposi's sarcoma, or pneumonia, all of which are called AIDS  now. There's no such thing."
<p>
In light of this knowledge, why does the scientific community still  officially consider H.I.V. the sole cause of 29 deadly and unique diseases? "[In  1984]," Duesberg explains, "the AIDS epidemic was just starting, Reagan was to be  re-elected, and the vocal gay community was requesting some actions against AIDS.  The preferred answer to a new disease was the hope for a fast career, and the  prevention of a microbe, virus, or bacteria. If you claim a virus or a microbe,  everybody knows what to do. A company starts making vaccines or test kits or  drugs. Everything looks promising....
<p>
"That's exactly what happened," Duesberg continues. "Gallo stood up and said,  I have a virus; Margaret Heckler, secretary of Health and Human Services, said,  we have found the probable cause of AIDS. They opened the floodgates of the  political and federal money to study AIDS and to confront AIDS only in the name  of this one hypothesis. They created an instant orthodoxy, mostly of virologists  who [had been] looking for viruses for over 30 years."
<p>
Duesberg proposes a simple, cost-effective study to determine, once and for  all, whether H.I.V. leads to AIDS. "Why don't we look at H.I.V.-infected people  who have no other reasons to get AIDS -- no lifestyle, drug, or disease factors -- and  who are not hemophiliacs?" He says that U.S. Army and blood-donor tests detect  thousands of such cases, and asks, "Why don't AIDS epidemiologists ever look at  those people and check them every week, or month, or year, for disease? This  study can distinguish between these alternatives -- is it H.I.V. or is it drugs or  is it transfusions? It would be so easy to do; it would be the cheapest study of  them all."
<p>
While H.I.V. and AIDS are indeed correlated, the causative link has not been  proven. One reason to doubt that H.I.V. causes AIDS is that many people who have  been diagnosed as H.I.V.-positive never become sick. The editors of the  newsletter "Rethinking AIDS" (now renamed "Reappraising AIDS") point out that  approximately 75 percent of American hemophiliacs have had H.I.V. for more than  seven years, yet only two percent annually develop AIDS-indicator diseases.  According to predictions, about 50 percent should have developed AIDS. There are  also incidences of H.I.V.-positive homosexual men who have remained healthy for  more than a decade.
<p>
Further, in experiments, chimpanzees repeatedly inoculated with H.I.V. never  develop the syndrome. As Charles A. Thomas, molecular biologist and former  Harvard and Johns Hopkins professor, explains, "The H.I.V. infects these animals,  multiplies, elicits the information of antibody, and then disappears, just like  in humans. Even after many years, not one chimp has come down with AIDS diseases.  This means we have an animal model for H.I.V., and it does not seem to cause  AIDS." 
<p>
The possibility of being H.I.V.-positive without developing AIDS does not  discount causation as much as the reverse scenario, of which there is ample  evidence. Numerous cases of AIDS without H.I.V. have always existed and were  even discussed at the Eighth International Conference on AIDS, in Amsterdam.  "[There are] an approximate 5,000 cases of AIDS without H.I.V. in groups  considered to be at risk of developing the syndrome," Duesberg reports. "There  may be many more, as in the U.S. only 50 percent of all cases of AIDS are  confirmed H.I.V.-positive; the rest are presumptive diagnoses. In science the  exception does not prove the rule; it disproves the hypothesis. Such findings  also conclude that H.I.V. is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce an immune  deficiency and AIDS-defining illnesses."
<p>
AIDS minus H.I.V. is especially prevalent in Africa, where being  H.I.V.-positive is not even a factor in diagnosis. According to Geshekter, "the  definition of AIDS in Africa is ... fundamentally different than the definition  of AIDS that is used in industrialized countries. If an African in a supposedly  highly infected country like Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire, is diagnosed with the  following clinical symptoms -- a persistent cough, a high fever, chronic diarrhea,  a ten-percent weight loss in the last two months -- and lives in one of these  countries, that person has AIDS." Nevertheless, Western scientists claim that  85 percent of the African population is positive for H.I.V. antibodies, when  tests are rarely, if ever, performed to determine this.
<p>
When AIDS was first declared an epidemic, government agencies confidently  predicted that before long, H.I.V. would spread from the initial risk groups,  i.e., homosexual men, intravenous-drug users, and hemophiliacs, to the  population at large. After all, that is what normally happens when people have  not yet developed an immunity to a new virus. Contrary to this forecast, though,  AIDS has remained within specific high-risk groups, and the incidence of H.I.V.  has decreased. Johnson says that according to Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention statistics "the figures have been going down. They still like to  claim that one million Americans are H.I.V.-positive, but professionals know  that the numbers are from 600,000 to 800,000. It's just for public-relations  reasons that this isn't acknowledged, because it's totally inconsistent with  the idea that H.I.V. infection is ravaging whole new populations and spreading  like wildfire."
<p>
The concept of AIDS as a sexually transmitted disease is another part of the  establishment picture that doesn't quite hold up. There is, in fact, no support  for the idea that AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease anywhere in the world.  Duesberg uses discordant couples as an example -- people who are diagnosed as  having AIDS but whose partners remain uninfected. "There are thousands of those,"  he says. "One of the most famous examples is Arthur Ashe. He had H.I.V. for ten  years and died of AIDS, but his wife and daughter are both H.I.V.-negative....  There are 15,000 American hemophiliacs who are H.I.V.-positive, and there isn't  one study that shows that the wives of hemophiliacs get AIDS from their  partners."
<p>
We should note, too, that AIDS has not spread to those who have intimate  contact with the virus -- scientists and health-care workers. Normally these  people are at high risk for contracting an infectious disease. For example,  1,500 cases of hepatitis are reported each year from accidental needle pricks.  Yet this has never been documented to happen on a statistically significant  scale among health-care workers or scientists who work with blood from  H.I.V.-positive and AIDS patients.

<h3>The Real Causes of AIDS</h3>
<p>
In December 1994, Richard Horton, then North American editor, now editor, of  <cite>The Lancet,</cite>&nbsp; stated, "It's been a year when there's been a painful  reassessment of all the assumptions that have been the foundation of AIDS science  during the past decade. People have been forced to admit uncertainties they were  unwilling to admit before."
<p>
Today, scientists are looking increasingly to cofactors -- non-H.I.V.  immunosuppressive factors that, when combined with the presence of the virus  (although not always), cause what we call AIDS. These factors became more  prevalent just as AIDS was being recognized as a "new" entity. But the thing is,  most of the dissidents say, AIDS is not really a new phenomenon. The  opportunistic infections satisfying the C.D.C. criteria for AIDS, such as  Kaposi's sarcoma and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, have been  around for decades.
<p>
It has long been established that the chemistry of the body of most people  with AIDS, and those considered to be living at risk, does not look like any  typical response to a single viral agent. In terms of chemical interactions, AIDS  is far closer to resembling a "stress response." This situation is characterized  by an increase in the production of certain chemical "messengers" called  cytokines that coordinate the immune system. The overproduction of cytokines can  cause a persistent suppression of immunity that impairs the body's immune  response.
<p>
Four factors that are major causes of oxidative stress and overproduction of  inflammatory cytokines are chemical toxicity, from both recreational and  medicinal drug use, as well as environmental sources; microbial activity, from  multiple and concurrent infections that may be viral, bacterial, fungal, or  protozoal; nutritional deficiencies, a diet deficient in antioxidants, coupled  with other nutritional deficiencies; and psychological stresses, e.g., fear,  anxiety, or sustained stress. All of these factors, in differing combinations  and to varying degrees, are found in people with AIDS and many of those  considered to be living at risk.
<p>
<b>Drugs.</b> In Duesberg's view, the strongest cofactor tie-in to AIDS is  that of chemical toxicity. "[Drug use] explains why it's in the 22- to  45-year-olds and not in the kids or the old people. This explains why it's  mostly in males, because ... males consume 80 percent of the hard psychoactive  drugs. And this explains why the infants of 70 percent of junkie mothers have  AIDS. This explains why homosexuals who inhale poppers to facilitate anal  intercourse get Kaposi's sarcoma. This explains absolutely everything about  AIDS."
<p>
<b>Infective agents.</b> Microbial cofactors in AIDS are held to be just as  important as drugs by many in the field. Christopher Calapai, D.O., explains the  role of sexually transmitted organisms. "Since Dr. [Luc] Montagnier in Paris has  said that mycoplasma is a very common cofactor and will allow the disease to  progress," Calapai says, "we're looking at various other viruses, fungal  organisms, and bacteria as cofactors in this syndrome. We know that those  individuals who are H.I.V.-positive and those who have AIDS frequently have  infections such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes virus I, II,  and VI, hepatitis B virus, and T.B. We also know that those individuals who  are hemophiliacs that are H.I.V.-positive have a fourfold chance of developing  AIDS if they are cytomegalovirus-positive."
<p>
Researchers at Columbia University now believe that human herpes virus VI  plays a major part in Kaposi's sarcoma. Investigative journalist Nina Ostrum  reports that "researchers all over the country are discovering that what H.H.-VI  [Type A] does to the immune system is much more devastating than anything that  H.I.V. is able to do. No one has put forth a convincing argument about how  H.I.V. causes AIDS, and no one has been able to use H.I.V. in an animal model  to create an AIDS-like illness. On the other hand, we know exactly what H.H.-VI  does. It goes right in and it destroys T cells, B cells, and a very important  immune-system cell called the natural-killer cell. It's been associated with a  number of cancers, including oral cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma. It's the real  heavyweight virus. All of the research shows this to be the case."
<p>
Marjorie Siebert, D.O., states that "herpes is found in almost every case of  full-blown AIDS. The herpes virus, like Epstein-Barr, has immune-suppressive  properties of its own and increases the replication of the H.I.V. virus." She  adds that the immunosuppressive action of certain viruses is already known,  saying, "Epstein-Barr virus, in its own right, is an immunosuppressive agent,  and when combined with H.I.V. increases the penetration of white blood cells  by the H.I.V. virus.... When herpes lesions or lesions of syphilis, molluscum,  or papilloma virus are present, H.I.V. spreads much more quickly during  intimate contact."
<p>
One sexually transmitted disease in particular has a strong association with  AIDS. In 1989 the Los Angeles Health Department said that epidemiological  studies showed a history of syphilis to be the most common predictor of the  development of AIDS, in the absence of all other factors. And there is a high  correlation between those most at risk of developing AIDS and those most at risk  of contracting syphilis. For example, if you are gay in the United States,  statistically you are 14 times more likely to have had syphilis than if you  are heterosexual (and therefore 14 times more likely to have had antibiotic  treatment, another cofactor). Between 1981 and 1989 the recorded number of  cases of syphilis in the United States increased by a significant 34 percent. 
<p>
An additional risk factor to consider is parasites, which readily accompany a  fast-track lifestyle. Cocaine, for instance, has been shown to reduce resistance  to intestinal parasites.
<p>
<b>Nutrition.</b> Many studies have shown that people with AIDS, and those  considered to be living at risk, suffer from wide-ranging nutritional  deficiencies. Specific nutrient abnormalities that have been found include  vitamins A, E, B2, B6, and B12, and the minerals copper, zinc, and selenium. In  addition to these nutrients, the amino-acid-related substance glutathione has  also been found typically deficient.
<p>
It must be stressed here that a diet high in processed and refined foods, and  low in whole and "live" foods, has become the staple diet for the majority of  people living in the West. Western food products are further corrupted by the  use of pesticides and herbicides, and almost all meat products contain  antibiotics, hormones, and steroids. Such a diet not only leads to vitamin and  mineral deficiencies, but will also cause annihilation of the bowel flora  ("friendly" bacteria essential for suppressing yeast overgrowth and synthesizing  certain vitamins), toxic overload in the body, and a weakened immune system.
<p>
<b>Psychological factors.</b> Part of the AIDS myth is the idea that this is  an incurable disease. Thus, most people who are newly diagnosed as being  H.I.V.-positive have been led to believe that they have just been condemned to  die. Now, literally hundreds of studies in the field of psychoneuroimmunology  have shown that what a person thinks -- in either a positive or a negative  vein -- has definite and immediate biochemical effects on the immune system. So  to put someone into such an acutely negative state of mind is a good way to  substantially exacerbate the progress of whatever disease they have. This is  part of what prompts immunologist Dr. Alfred Hassig to state, "The sentences  of death accompanying the medical diagnosis of AIDS should be abolished." And  Nick Siano, author of <cite>No Time to Wait,</cite>&nbsp; says, "The things that we're  feeding people emotionally about this disease are much more deadly than H.I.V.  itself. The emotional content of H.I.V. infection is 75 percent of the battle.

<h3>A.Z.T. and the Economics of AIDS</h3>
<p>
A.Z.T. has long been the medical orthodoxy's choice treatment for AIDS and  people who are H.I.V.-positive. But has this drug been proven safe and  effective? Researchers are now saying some disturbing things. For instance,  Duesberg claims that A.Z.T. "is AIDS by prescription. Nothing could cause AIDS  more directly than a substance that is doing only one thing -- killing cells,  particularly the cells in the bone marrow, which are the immune system. You are  killing off your immune system every six hours with A.Z.T." Geneticist Richard  Strohman states, "There's every reason to think that A.Z.T. will kill you faster  than an AIDS-related disease ... because it's a D.N.A.-chain terminator. It will  kill every cell in your body that's making D.N.A."
<p>
Why are these sorts of conclusions being suppressed and ridiculed? To answer  this question, we need to understand the lengths to which powerful business  interests will go in order to protect their products and themselves.
<p>
A.Z.T. was originally developed as a chemotherapy agent in the late 60s for  the treatment of leukemia, but was soon found to be too toxic for human use, and  thus was shelved. In the early 80s, the drug was revived as a treatment for AIDS  on the theory that it would inhibit the replication of the H.I.V. virus. There is  no denying that AIDS creates a lucrative business for A.Z.T.'s manufacturers.  Ralph W. Moss, Ph.D., adviser to the Office of Alternative Medicine of the  National Institutes of Health, says that "these things happen as a matter of  course in the search for the highest possible profits out of the medical system."  Frank Buianouckas elaborates on how keeping the H.I.V. theory alive supports  business interests. "I am suspect about everything involved in this AIDS  epidemic," he explaines, "because if H.I.V. causes anything, it certainly causes  fund-raisers. It sells stocks. It supports dances. It sells condoms. And it keeps  the AIDS establishment going...."
<p>
One reason to be skeptical about the quality of the information we're getting  is that the so-called AIDS authorities are the same people who were the so-called  cancer experts. As Dr. Bruce Halstead explains, "Many cancer authorities have  shifted over to AIDS for the simple reason that it is where a lot of the money is  available, and it is where you have more opportunity." Moss further explains the  link between AIDS, cancer, and business, saying, "The paradigm that was laid  down for how to milk the cancer problem is basically the same paradigm which  is being followed in milking the AIDS problem. Here's how it breaks down. The  largest producer of chemotherapy in the world is Bristol-Myers Squibb. They make  between 40 and 50 percent of all the chemotherapy. They also make the AIDS drug  D.D.I. [And members] of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering board [have also been] high  officials of Bristol-Myers Squibb."
<p>
Allowing the same people to run the show doesn't bode all that well for the  possibility of finding a cure. Look at these statistics quoted by Dr. Seymour  Brenner: "In 1950, the year I started in my practice, 50.6 percent of all people  diagnosed as having cancer died. In 1990, 40 years later, after approximately $40  billion has been spent in research, 49.7 percent of all people diagnosed as  having cancer die. Nine-tenths of one percent improvement."
<p>
While AIDS is actually a complex of approximately 25 different diseases, one  drug is put forth as an all-encompassing AIDS weapon. This presents vast  economic opportunities for those who are in on the profits. Halstead states  that "you have a single drug that can be patented, and with this patent, you  essentially have a drug monopoly."  But the desire for a profit from a patentable  product excludes research into safe, natural substances. As Robert Cathcart, M.D.,  explains, "It has been estimated that it takes anywhere from 15 to 50 million  dollars to get a drug through the F.D.A. If a drug is not patentable, it does not  pay for the drug company to do the double-blind studies and the toxicity studies  on animals, or whatever is required by the F.D.A. to prove it. So we have this  interesting situation where nutritional substances, which are not patentable, are  excluded from being looked at by the F.D.A."

<h3>Our Uninquisitive Press</h3>
<p>
The media have not been quick on the uptake concerning challenges to A.Z.T. In  fact, the mainstream media, always attuned to the quick and easy in the way of  explanations, has not been much help in asking any of the difficult questions  about AIDS. Ostrum points out that simplistic government propaganda is easier to  report than more complex perspectives. "If they only have one microbe to warn you  about, if there's one virus to produce disease, and there's one thing that you  should do to prevent it, and that is to have safe sex or not share needles ...  that's a very easy message for the press to pick up on."
<p>
In addition, reporters believe that science and medicine are too sacrosanct to  question. Tom Bethel feels that "the interesting thing is that the media has not  been going after this story at all. They regard very deferentially what the  government press releases say. This is exactly the opposite of the attitude  20-odd years ago. If you remember at the time of Watergate, Woodward and  Bernstein's method was, don't accept government handouts. Dig behind the  scenes, ask questions, don't accept that what they tell you is true...." Today,  Bethel says, while the media are sometimes still willing to dig behind the  scenes in fields like foreign or domestic policy, "when it comes to health  and science, they say, 'Uh-oh, I'm not qualified to question this.' They just  go along with the official version." 
<p>
Occasionally stories of A.Z.T. hazards slip into conventional newspapers,  but they are carefully hidden. The <cite>New York Times</cite>&nbsp; recently printed a  story on the dangers of A.Z.T. use with children. The article reported that  federal health officials determined A.Z.T. to have "unexpectedly high rates  of adverse side effects in children, like bleeding and biochemical  abnormalities," but this important information was buried on page C13.
<p>
But whatever page it's on, the news will come out eventually -- especially if  it's big enough and if it involves lawsuits. This is, in fact, what's starting  to happen with A.Z.T. NBC's "Today" covered the first lawsuit involving A.Z.T.  by featuring Susan Threakall, who is suing Burroughs Wellcome over the A.Z.T.  poisoning of her husband. The idea of going beyond the virus-only causality of  AIDS is one whose time has clearly come. We'll be hearing a lot more about it in  the future.

<strong>By Andrew Weil, M.D. </strong>

<p>


<center> <h2>Long-Term HIV Infection</h2> </center>
<p>
Mark  M. knows exactly when he got infected with the AIDS virus and from  whom he got it. It was in 1983 from a male sexual partner; the man's previous partner  died shortly afterward. One month after this contact Mark became very sick  with a skin rash and a mysterious  pneumonia that was never identified. He remained very sick for three months,  then recovered and has been healthy ever since. In 1985 he tested positive  for HIV. At that time his helper T cell count was over 1,000. (Helper T cells are  the targets of HIV; as their numbers decline, people become more susceptible  to opportunistic infections.) In 1989 his T cell count had dropped to 700.
<p>
Since  his recovery from the initial infection, Mark has been very conscientious  about his health, especially about  his diet and mental state. He eats a lot of raw garlic--one head a day, chopped  and mixed with food--because he read about garlic's beneficial effects on the  immune system. He also eats a lot of hot chile peppers and buys only organically  produced food, including some meat and chicken and a substantial quantity  of fruits, fruit juice, and vegetables. He takes vitamins, drinks purified water,  and walks, swims, and gardens regularly. He lives in a monogamous relationship,  works as director of a program  that provides counseling for persons with HIV, and creates art objects that  he uses in healing rituals. In 1991, Mark's T cell Count was up to 1,300; and  when he was last tested, in 1994, it was still 1,300, which is in the normal range.
<p>
"The  medical professionals gave me six to eighteen months to live when  I was first diagnosed," Mark told me when I met him. "Since 1985 I can't tell you  how many doctors have shown me the Curve -- that is, the graph showing the percentage  of people per year who  develop AIDS after infection. They all try to tell me I'm somewhere along it,  headed for destruction. This is really Western medicine's fascination with illness.  Here I am with normal T cells, in great health, and they have the audacity  to tell me I'm on this curve heading for death. When I see doctors now, I tell  them right at the start: 'Look, I don't even want to hear about your curve. Just  check me out, answer my questions, and keep your opinions to yourself!' They  have also all tried to get me  to take AZT [the antiviral drug that is conventional medicine's current treatment  of choice for HIV], but all of the people I've known who have used it are dead,  so I've refused. And none of them have been interested to hear what I'm doing  to stay healthy. They pat me on the head and say, 'Whatever you're doing, just  keep it up!'
<p>
"I have developed an ability not to buy into the medical system  and a willingness to accept that I have control over what happens to me with  HIV. I am also committed to not  being afraid. I use visualization every day to neutralize fear; I've been doing  it since I was a kid, because I came from a disastrous family and was subjected  to incest and a lot of verbal and physical abuse. Things come up everyday--like  a funny spot on my arm recently. I visualized it going away, and it did. It  was nothing. I'm also in ongoing psychotherapy. For the past seven years I've  used it to keep centered. In my work I act as a healthy role model for persons  newly diagnosed with HIV. I counsel  them and don't reveal that I'm HIV-positive till later. It's an effective  technique. Many of these people, especially as a result of their inter actions  with doctors, think they'll die within two years. I'm here to show them it doesn't  have to be that way."
<p>
I did not have much to tell Mark except to make him  aware of some of the Chinese herbal tonics that look promising for keeping HIV  in remission.
<p>
<cite>Comment: </cite>&nbsp;With a life-threatening illness for which  conventional medicine has  no effective treatment, it takes conscious effort to get needed services from doctors  (like monitoring of T cell counts) with out taking on their pessimism. One  of the most interesting and encouraging features of HIV infection is its tendency  to go into a long latent period before it begins to compromise immunity.  Conventional therapy centers on chemical weapons against the virus, but these drugs  are all toxic and may select for strains of HIV that are less inclined to  live in balance with their human  hosts. For many years, medical doctors paid no attention to long-term survivors  of HIV infection like Mark. Now enough cases have surfaced that researchers  are beginning to study them. One possibility is that some of these people are infected  with less virulent strains of HIV and may have developed immunity to them  (which could help scientists develop an effective vaccine). Many long-term survivors  have relied on healthy lifestyles and therapies to support the healing  system, such as Chinese herbal  remedies. If the latent period of HIV infection could be extended to twenty-five  or thirty years, people with the virus might live out relatively normal lives.  (They could, of course, still infect others.) 
<p>

<br>
THESE CASE EXAMPLES show  how correct decisions about treatment, particularly about whether and how to  use conventional medicine, can allow the healing system to resolve a variety of  serious health problems. Once you establish the right relationship with the conventional  system, your next task  is to make wise choices from among the great variety of alternative therapies  now available. 
<p>

<br>
<center> <h2>Astragalus</h2> </center>
<p>
If you are Chinese you will recognize  this tonic herb at once. Under the name <cite>huangqi </cite>&nbsp;it is widely sold  both singly and in many combination formulas for the treatment of colds and  flus. <cite>Astragalus is </cite>&nbsp;a large genus in the pea family, some species  of which are toxic to live stock. (Locoweed of the American Southwest is an astragalus.)  But the toxins are only  in the above-ground parts, never in the roots, and it is the root of a nontoxic  Chinese species, <cite>Astragalus membranaceous, </cite>&nbsp;that provides the herbal  medicine. The plant is a perennial herb with long, fibrous roots, native  to northern China and Inner Mongolia. Both wild and cultivated plants are sources  of commercial astragalus, which is sold in bundles of thin slices that resemble  wooden tongue depressors and have a sweet taste. Chinese herbalists recommend  adding these slices to soups  and removing them before serving because they are too tough to chew. You can buy  dried astragalus in Chinese herb stores, or you can buy astragalus tinctures  and capsules in health food stores. You will also find in health food stores many  Chinese herbal products that contain astragalus as a principal ingredient.
<p>
Traditional  Chinese doctors consider this plant a true tonic that can strengthen  debilitated patients and increase resistance to disease in general. They also  use it as a promoter of other  herbs known to increase energy, aid digestion, and stimulate the production  and circulation of blood. In contemporary Chinese medicine astragalus is also a  chief component of <cite>fu zheng </cite>&nbsp;therapy, a combination herbal  treatment to restore immune function in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy  and radiation. Research in China has demonstrated increased survival in  patients receiving both herbal and Western therapies, as well as moderation of  the immunosuppressive effects of  the latter.
<p>
Pharmacological studies in the West confirm that astragalus enhances  immune function. It increases activity of several kinds of white blood cells  as well as production of antibodies and interferon. These properties have  to do with the root's content of polysaccharides, large molecules composed of chains  of sugar subunits. Polysaccharides are structural components of many organisms;  until recently they did not excite much interest among Western pharmacologists,  because they are not the  types of molecules that act as magic bullets and because conventional wisdom holds that they cannot even be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. But polysaccharides  are a common feature of many herbal medicines that enhance immunity,  so we must not yet understand their properties.
<p>
I recommend astragalus to  many patients, since I find it to be safe and effective. In particular, I suggest  it for people with chronic infectious diseases, such as bronchitis, sinusitis,  and AIDS. I also recommend  it to many cancer patients, both those undergoing conventional treatment and those  who have completed treatment. And I think taking astragalus regularly is beneficial  for people who are debilitated, lacking in energy or vitality, or feeling  vulnerable to stress. It is easy to find astragalus products in health food  stores; follow dosages specified on the labels.
<p>

<br>
<center> <h2>Maitake</h2> </center>

<p>
Maitake  is the Japanese name for an edible and delicious mushroom, <cite>Grifola frondosa,  </cite>&nbsp;known to mushroom hunters  in America as "hen of-the-woods," because it grows in big clusters on the  ground at the bases of trees or stumps, clusters that resemble the fluffed tailfeathers  of a nesting hen. The Japanese name means "dancing mushroom," possibly  because people danced with joy on finding this rare and prized species. Finding  a big hen-of-the-woods--they can weigh up to a hundred pounds--can indeed be  cause for celebration, not only because it is a huge quantity of a choice wild  mushroom but also because it is  an eminently salable commodity worth twenty dollars a pound or more. Italians  love to cook it in sauces for pasta or pickle it in olive oil and vinegar marinades  after parboiling. Unfortunately, maitake in the wild is uncommon, even though  it will fruit in the same spot for many years.
<p>
In 1965 a master Japanese  mushroom hunter wrote: "Top rank hunters are those who seek maitake. They go out  to their own secret grounds to spend several days looking for maitake with a  dream of for tune at a stroke.  Maitake hunters are not supposed to let others know their secret spot. If he finds  a spot where he can crop more than 10 kg (7'' lbs) of maitake, he found a  'treasure island.' He would never tell anyone his secret location until he dies.  He would only indicate the location in his will to his eldest son just before  he dies. Some hunters are even willing to die without telling their own sons or  families...."
<p>
All this changed in the early 1980'S, when Japanese scientists  dis covered how to cultivate  maitake on sawdust; the cultivated form is now sold at reasonable prices in supermarkets  throughout Japan. 
<p>
Mushroom growers in this country are just beginning  to experiment with it. In cultivation the mushroom looks like a floral bouquet  in shades of gray and gray-brown, except, instead of flowers, it is made  up of many overlapping, fan-shaped mushroom caps. The undersides are white, with  tiny pores instead of gills. <cite>Grifola </cite>&nbsp;belongs to a family of mushrooms  called polypores, distinguished  by that kind of spore bearing tissue. In general polypores are nontoxic,  but only a few are edible; most are tough and woody, growing as brackets or shelves  on dead or living trees. In the West, polypore mushrooms have mainly been  of interest to forest pathologists, because they are important causes of heart  rot in living trees and important decomposers of dead and dying trees; but in  the Far East, many of them are highly esteemed as medicinal herbs, especially in  the class of superior drugs,  the tonics and panaceas that increase resistance and promote longevity.
<p>
Traditional  Chinese doctors did not use maitake, but they did use many of its relatives,  including a very close relative, <cite>Polyporus umbellatus, </cite>&nbsp;or zhu  ling. Modern testing has shown zhu ling to have anti cancer and immune-enhancing  properties related to its content of polysaccharides. Now Japanese researchers  have tested maitake for similar effects, with impressive results. In fact,  extracts of maitake turn out to  be more powerful anticancer and immune-enhancing agents than any of the other  medicinal mushrooms tested so far. In combination with chemotherapy, they increase  the effectiveness of lower doses of Western drugs, while protecting the immune  system from toxic dam age. Perhaps Chinese doctors will begin including this  mushroom in their fu zheng therapy. Maitake extracts also show activity against  HIV and hepatitis as well as an antihypertensive effect.
<p>
Until cultivated  maitake turns up in supermarkets  here a likely prospect, because the mushroom is not difficult to grow, retains  its freshness extremely well, and has a firm texture and good flavor-- you will  have to buy tablets and capsules of maitake extracts in health food stores.  Several firms are now marketing these products, using material imported from Japan.  Prices are high but should come down once cultivation catches on here.
<p>
I  recommend supplements of maitake to people with cancer, AIDS, and other immune  system problems as well as to  those with chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic hepatitis, and environmental illnesses  that may represent toxic overloads. As soon as fresh maitake becomes available,  I will make it a regular addition to my diet.

<h4>DESPERATE CANCER  VICTIMS SAY JIMMY KELLER IS A MIRACLE WORKER.<br> THE GOVERNMENT SAYS HE'S A CON MAN.</H4>
<p>
<strong>By Paul Ciotti</strong> (Paul Ciotti is a Los Angeles Times Magazine staff writer).</center>
<p>
The first time patients  saw St. Jude's International  Cancer  Clinic in Tijuana, it was a wonder they  didn't turn around and leave.  The clinic was in a decrepit two-story building in a desolate hillside neighborhood.  The finish stucco had fallen off the facade in places, and some of the windows  were covered with plastic and tape. To reach the clinic offices, you went  down a long, dark-paneled hallway opening into a small, four-room suite. And nearly  anytime between 9 a.m. and dusk, that's where you'd find the director, Jimmy  Keller, a small, slightly-stooped man with longish gray hair, a salt-and-pepper  beard and thick glasses that  always hung at a precarious angle across his face. 
<p>
That was a result of  his  cancer.  Twenty-three years ago, he lost his left ear, part of his neck and  his major facial nerves to radical  cancer  surgery. The left side of his face  sagged. His eyeglasses had nothing to hook onto -- the spot where his ear used  to be was a round, gray traumatic scar, the size of a saucer, with a little black  hole in the middle for his ear canal. 
<p>
But none of this mattered to the  people who drove up the steep,  potholed streets to St. Jude's, lining the curb with their cars and vans and U.S.  license plates. Once their oncologists had pronounced the death sentence --  "I'm sorry. There's nothing more I can do" -- they went to Keller. And Keller  was unique. He had a presence. His easy southern drawl inspired trust. "You feel  intensely cared about," said one Redondo Beach family therapist treated by Keller  for  cancer  of the stomach, cervix and breast. 
<p>
People would walk in the  front door and see a long hall  lined with people sitting in chairs under amino-acid IV drips, laughing, talking  and welcoming the newcomers. "You have  cancer? " they'd burble. "Oh, really?  What kind?" 
<p>
It was Keller who set the tone. He was always touching people,  putting his arms around them, telling them he loved them. 
<p>
"Is this part  of the treatment?" a woman asked him once. 
<p>
"Yes," Keller said. 
<p>
He gave  everyone hugs and kisses. Men, too. People would come to his clinic and wonder  what they were getting into --  his clinic was full of  cancer patients singing songs. 
<p>
Then on March 18, 1991,  the singing stopped.  At 9 in the morning, while Keller was examining patients,  men with guns burst into the clinic. "Who are they?" asked Keller, looking  up in surprise. That's when they pulled him out the door to a waiting van. 
<p>
"Jimmy  has just been kidnaped by four thugs," a patient screamed into the telephone.  "My God! What are we going to do?" 
<p>
There was nothing they could do.  The men were from Mexican immigration.  After taking Keller back to their office, they disappeared, and six other  men in dungarees and blue work shirts, who declined to identify themselves,  entered the room, seized him and walked him across the border to San Ysidro. 
<p>
There  he was arrested by the FBI and arraigned on 12 counts of conspiracy to  commit wire fraud (specifically that he or someone working for him made telephone  calls across interstate lines to attract people to his Mexican clinic). Keller  was flown to Brownsville, Tex.,  where bail was set at $5 million cash. Then, in August, the judge moved the  proceedings 50 miles up the Rio Grande to McAllen, Tex. 
<p>
Keller's trial had  begun. 
<p>
Although his friends were shocked and appalled at this dramatic turn  of events, Keller himself was not totally surprised. People had been trying  to put him in jail for the past 15 years. As he saw it, there was too much money  at stake for the " cancer  industry" to sit idly by while "alternative practitioners"  increasingly took their  clients away. "I had the most successful clinic that's ever been run," he maintained.  "They didn't punish me for being unsuccessful but for being too successful."  
<p>
Ridiculous, responded William Jarvis, head of the Loma Linda-based National  Council Against Health Fraud. What people like Keller do, Jarvis says,  is exploit desperate, alienated and guilt-ridden  cancer  victims, infusing them  with their own paranoia until these people start to believe that "the FDA is  the enemy and that the National   Cancer  Institute is involved in this giant conspiracy to withhold these wonderful  cures." Keller wasn't a healer, Jarvis contended -- he was a transparent  fraud who dispensed worthless secret serums and misdiagnosed  cancer  victims with  pseudo-scientific machines. "Those are so fraudulent on their face it's hard  not to judge Keller as a pathological liar." 
<p>
McAllen, Tex., a flat, languid  farm town of 90,000 people (16% unemployed), is not an ideal place to spend  the summer. Cloudbursts hit without  warning in the middle of the afternoon, and at night warm winds rattle the  palm fronds, bang screen doors and otherwise fray the nerves. The federal marshals  in U.S. District Court Judge Filemon Vela's courtroom were on edge in August  for reasons that went beyond the weather. Seventy-five friends, relatives and  former patients had shown up in McAllen for Keller's trial, and the marshals  at first thought they were dealing with some health-fanatic religious cult. 
<p>
The  prosecutors, too, were confounded  by the intensity of support for Keller. Because they started with the assumption  that Keller was the worst and most obvious kind of fraud, they couldn't  explain the fierce loyalty of Keller's patients except by postulating that he  had a charismatic hold on them -- which to Keller's patients was absurd. Far  from being some kind of cult leader, Keller was actually rather shy. He was deferential,  easily moved to tears and, as one man put it, so "profoundly self-effacing"  that he found it difficult  to ask patients to pay their bills. It wasn't Keller's alleged charisma that  made him so beloved by his former patients, said Redondo Beach family therapist  Ruth Kerhart; it was his care. "We are dying when we come to him. We have given  up. We are headed for death, and all of a sudden we're going in the other direction."  
<p>
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mervyn Mosbacker didn't see it that way.  A graduate of the University of Texas Law School, he was 37 years old, with a pale,  smooth face, a dogged manner  and, most important, perhaps, a righteous conviction that Keller belonged behind  bars. 
<p>
As Mosbacker painted Keller, he was a quack, a con man who'd treated  people with an expensive and allegedly potent wonder drug, Tumorex, which  he'd claimed was a "live-cell polypeptide" smuggled out of West Germany. In fact,  it was mainly water and L-Arginine -- a common, everyday amino acid that, Mosbacker  said, had no efficacy whatsoever in the treatment of  cancer.  Although  Keller claimed he'd had an 80%  to 90% success rate with people whose immune systems had not been compromised  by surgery, radiation or chemotherapy, his alleged cures, Mosbacker said, were  nothing but delusion, fantasy and outright fraud. The FBI did a study of the 135  or so patients Keller had treated during the nine months covered by the indictment  (from March though December, 1983). Of the 103 the FBI was able to locate,  91 were dead, nine were alive but still had  cancer,  and three were  cancer  -free. 
<p>
The case, as the prosecutor  hammered it home to the jury, was really very simple: Keller claimed he  could cure  cancer  and had the chutzpah to charge  cancer  patients $3,000 for  three weeks' treatment with a watered-down amino acid, and, in the end, his patients  all died anyway. 
<p>
As Jimmy Keller sat in the courtroom day after day,the  story of his life that the prosecutor told seemed so alien and twisted that  when old friends drove out to see him at the Hildago County Jail, he'd seize  their hands and burst into tears.  There was far more to his story than the judge or prosecution ever dreamed,  he said. "If they knew what I knew (about how to stop  cancer) , they'd dismiss  the case." 
<p>
I am, on this warm Saturday night in late summer, talking to Keller  in one of the jail's small administrative offices at the end of a long corridor  next to an unlocked outside door. If Keller had wanted to, he could have  taken three steps, turned left and fled unnoticed into the humid, bug-filled night.  Instead, he leaned back and  began his story in his low-key, casual way, the same way he always tells it,  starting with that fateful summer of 1968 when he developed a black  mole,  as  big as a golf ball, in his left ear, pressing on his earlobe. "My doctor said if  I had immediate radical surgery, I had a 50-50 chance of living. This mutilation  was the price I had to pay to get rid of my tumor." 
<p>
Although the operation  was successful, it left Keller bitter and depressed. He owned a thriving water-softener  business in Baton  Rouge, but with his left ear gone and left-side facial nerves severed, he felt  "hideous," "a monster." "I was scaring people," he recalls. On top of everything  else, within two months,  cancer  nodules grew back in his neck, arms and groin.  This time, his doctors recommended the same kind of radiation treatment they  had previously told him wouldn't work.  Unwilling to undergo radiation or further  surgery, Keller fell into despair. He began to drink. By December, 1968, he  was "in real bad condition. I  had lumps all over me. I was in pain. I had no appetite. My parents were making  novenas to St. Jude." 
<p>
Then one day his parents got an unsigned letter about  an alternative  cancer clinic in Dallas. "And so to please my mom and dad, I  went to Dallas and started on (an herbal anti- cancer)  treatment." 
<p>
To Keller's  amazement, after three months his tumors softened and disappeared, his weight  returned to normal and he became an alternative-treatment zealot. "I was on  fire to tell people about other  treatments. I was going into the hospitals to tell other people but no one was  listening." 
<p>
It was just as well. The government closed the clinic in 1969,  leaving Keller and the others with no place to go for treatment, so Keller's  modest house in Baton Rouge became by default the center of an informal self-help  society where patients gave each other Laetrile shots and chelation therapy.  For the next seven years, Keller openly practiced medicine without a license,  giving injections and megavitamin  IV drips, hanging the bottles on clothes hooks, treating as many as 20 people  a day from all over the country. 
<p>
In the process, Keller also became an outspoken  advocate for alternative health care, giving talks and TV interviews,  running letter-writing campaigns and, as state chairman of the Committee for Freedom  of Choice in  Cancer, lobbying the Louisiana Legislature for three straight  weeks in the mid-'70s to legalize Laetrile (an anti- cancer  drug derived from  apricot pits). The bill passed  91 to 1 in the House, 34 to 0 in the Senate, and got the governor's fast-track  signature in only three days. 
<p>
When the Georgia Legislature decided to hold  hearings on a similar bill, Keller showed up to announce that he was "going  to commit suicide before the Georgia House of Representatives." This was in response  to early medical testimony that eating six apricot kernels and half-a-dozen  500-milligram Laetrile tablets could cause a person to die from cyanide poisoning.  When it was Keller's turn  to speak, he first ate half-a-dozen apricot kernels and Laetrile tablets. "It  took me five minutes to chew them up. I was chewing and chewing." There was total  silence in the packed galleries. 
<p>
When it became clear that Keller wasn't  going to drop dead, pandemonium broke out. Members of the audience started shouting:  "They've been lying to us!" "The enemy is the FDA! That's the real enemy!"  Keller said that before he left, every member of the committee approached him  to thank him for exposing the  federal government's bias. 
<p>
Such tactics didn't endear him to the Louisiana  State Board of Medical Examiners, which had been trying without success to shut  him down for the previous three years. In those days, Keller used to walk around  with a .357 magnum on his hip and let it be known that "if anyone tried to  stop us I would take that as a threat on my life." More significant, there were  by then lots of important people among Keller's clients, including the executive  secretary to the governor of  Louisiana (who used to show up at Keller's clinic in an official state car) as  well as several friends of the district attorney of East Baton Rouge parish.  "The D.A. wouldn't prosecute me," Keller said. "I was appearing on TV. I was just  as arrogant as ever." 
<p>
Then in March, 1983, the State Board of Medical Examiners,  having failed to get anywhere with a criminal case, finally reversed field  and filed a civil suit against him for practicing medicine without a license.  A judge issued an injunction  and shut Keller down. It was the end of the line in Louisiana, and, organizing  a caravan of  cancer  patients, Keller moved his operation down to Matamoros,  Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Tex. 
<p>
For people used to traditional  medical care,Keller's operation came as quite a shock. Because he believed  that poor eating habits weakened the immune system's ability to fight  cancer,   he put all his patients on a strict diet of foods such as whole grains, fresh  vegetables, fish, fertile eggs  and chicken breasts. He urged patients to avoid aluminum pots, red meat, canned  goods, alcohol, coffee, white flour and salt. Not only was he suspicious of  the radiation used in  cancer  treatment, but he also avoided computer screens,  microwave ovens and even battery-powered watches, which, he said, upset the body's  natural energy flow. 
<p>
Keller deliberately tried to keep his clinic looking  as little like a hospital as possible. "I always wore just plain old clothes,"  he said. He didn't merely give  injections; he would hold people's hands and pray with them. A firm believer  in the power of positive imagery, he put a plaque above the mantel: "I do not  have  cancer.  Therefore I am going to live." At the end of the day, he'd call  everyone in to say the words together. 
<p>
Not surprisingly, some people were  put off by Keller. They'd come to Mexico to be cured of  cancer  by cutting-edge  medical science unavailable in overcautious U.S. clinics and instead found themselves  being treated by a one-eared  shaman with a southern drawl who was dressed in casual old clothes, praying,  hugging his patients and telling them he loved them. 
<p>
"He doesn't look  like a doctor," one woman told her son the first time she saw Keller. 
<p>
"Mom,  he isn't a doctor," her son said. "He's a healer. That's why we're here." 
<p>
But  even healers have their failures, and in 1981, Keller's biggest failure was  with himself. A tumor on his neck had began to grow and get hard again. But this  time, his regular remedies seemed  powerless to control it. Then at the annual meeting of the National Health  Federation in Dallas, he bought a supply of Tumorex. When he injected the amino  acid solution intravenously, he was astonished. "I felt a tingling in my tumor  areas. They got softer. It was phenomenal." 
<p>
Keller became a believer. The  instant he gave an injection, people would start feeling heat in their tumors  (a thermometer placed on the tumor, Keller said, showed a temperature rise of  one to two degrees). There was  a pulling, tingling, grabbing sensation. One patient said it felt like a thousand  little fingers pulling at her tumors. People with brain tumors heard popping  and cracking sounds as if fireworks were going off in their heads. Tumorex didn't  always work with everyone, but when it did, Keller said, the results could  be spectacular. Within hours, patients reported, tumors began to soften and shrink,  and within days they began to disappear. "On open tumors," Keller said, "you  could actually see bubbles."  
<p>
Visitors to the Keller clinic were astounded. They'd come back and tell stories  about having seen people who would come to the clinic near death, and who,  after a few days or few weeks of treatment, would be back on their feet again,  walking, shopping and ready to resume their normal lives. Dr. George Eisberg,  an Albuquerque family physician who testified at Keller's trial, told of escorting  a dying friend to Keller's clinic. "I wheeled him in in a wheelchair. He couldn't  swallow." But as soon as  Keller put him on the IV drip, the patient's chest pain subsided so much that  for dinner that night he went out and ordered a lobster and a pina colada. 
<p>
Dr.  David Steenblock, an El Toro osteopath, testified that he saw dozens of patients  with metastasized  cancer  make the trip to Keller's clinic -- and when  they came back, no  cancer  was visible on the bone scan. "He has a lot more success  with  cancer  patients than I have," Steenblock said. 
<p>
Joel Wallach, a  comparative pathologist from San  Ysidro, testified that Keller worked wonders with people's immune systems. "They  come home, gain weight, their T-cell level comes back up to normal and they  go back to work." 
<p>
But the best advertisements of all for Keller were his  former patients, people like Bonnie Cayer of Huntington Beach, Olga Quijano of  Torrance, Eleanor Dominquez of Culver City, Libby Hodges of Newport Beach, Rosaline  Raz of Tustin, Maxine Bachich from Malibu and Ruth Kerhart of Redondo Beach  -- all of whom testified that  when they first went to see Keller they were suffering variously from  cancer   of the breast, brain, stomach, cervix or  uterus.  Keller, they claimed, had stopped  their pain, shrunk their tumors and kept them alive and well for as long  as eight years. "I have talked to people who spent $150,000 on doctors and been  told to go home and die," Hodges said. "I spent $5,000, and he saved my life."  
<p>
Although much of what Keller did (administering injections, ordering transfusions  and prescribing vitamins  and diets) fell well within the realm of conventional medical practice, his  use of the Digitron D Spectrometer to diagnose and treat  cancer  dwelt in another  realm entirely. This was a kind of automated biofeedback machine (common in  Europe) that, according to Keller, operated on the body's "energy field." As he  explained it, "Every disease has its particular frequency." By having the patient  hold an electric coil and dialing in the right numbers, he could, he asserted,  diagnose  cancer  without  the need for biopsies, blood tests, CAT scans or X-rays. 
<p>
Not that it was any  simple matter. Operating the Digitron was a calling that required a kind of intuitive  skill, a sixth sense, even a kind of grace. "Truly, he is a born healer,"  said Quijano, a Torrance grandmother. "There are times I have felt such healing  energy." 
<p>
And that was another thing Keller's patients liked about him.  He didn't simply dispense serums and vitamins on some predetermined schedule;  he used the Digitron to test every  person every day to determine what kind of therapy or serums were needed at  that moment and in what amounts. He would make the diagnosis even if the patient  wasn't physically present. A mere Polaroid photo would suffice. Nor was the  Digitron limited only to the treatment of  cancer. Keller also used it to test  Tumorex and even five-gallon jugs of bottled drinking water. If he got a bad reading,  he'd send them right back. 
<p>
Keller wished he could do as much with the  FBI, which, on Dec. 7, 1983,  sent agent Claude Hildreth and Texas attorney general investigator Nora Dominguez  to Keller's Matamoros clinic with a hidden tape recorder. The two claimed claiming  to be the parents of a sick boy. But Keller got suspicious when they specifically  asked him how he "cured" leukemia, and he refused to be drawn into a  discussion. 
<p>
The FBI wasn't the only institution with an interest in Keller's  alleged ability to successfully treat  cancer.  On Dec. 14, 1983, the Brownsville  Herald ran a major investigative  piece on Keller's clinic, prompting the Matamoros Health Department to temporarily  seal the front door (flexible, as always, Mexican authorities left the  back door open). Frantic, Keller called his U.S. patient representative and  contact person, Maxine Lowder. 
<p>
"Have you seen anything in the newspapers about  us up there?" 
<p>
"No, why?" 
<p>
"It's in the newspapers and on TV that we  have a quack clinic and we're robbing people." 
<p>
That wasn't the half of it.  The Brownsville Herald story (based  in part on confidential investigative reports provided by state authorities)  concluded that Keller's clinic was an out-and-out fraud that robbed terminal  patients of both their money and their dignity. It described Keller's sales pitch  as "so ridiculous" as to be "funny" and reported that the Baton Rouge district  attorney who protected Keller all those years was under investigation by a  federal grand jury for taking bribes. 
<p>
As soon as Maxine Lowder got off the  telephone with Keller, she called  a CIA agent who had been treated at the clinic. 
<p>
The agent, who lived in  Florida, urged that Keller be sent to him immediately. "I'll get him out of the  country," he said. 
<p>
Keller left that day for Florida, slumped down in the back  seat of car. But by the time he got to Baton Rouge, Keller had a change of  heart. You couldn't just start patients on Tumorex and suddenly leave them high  and dry. 
<p>
"Jimmy, you got to get out of there," Lowder told him. 
<p>
"I can't.  I can't." 
<p>
"Jimmy, you can't  help them if you are in jail." 
<p>
It was no use. Keller flew back to Texas,  where he finished his patients' treatment in a Brownsville motel. 
<p>
"It was  a mistake to go to Matamoros," Keller said after closing the clinic. "People  weren't used to us. We were sitting ducks." 
<p>
By early 1984, Keller was back  in operation again,this time on the water at Rosarito Beach. According to Keller,  the U.S. attorney in Brownsville wanted to extradite him, but it was impossible  under Mexican law -- nothing  Keller was doing was illegal in Mexico (officially, Keller was simply the director  of a clinic that employed Mexican doctors). 
<p>
Then, over the Easter weekend,  1984, two FBI agents, Scott Weigmann and Walter Lamar, in the company of  Mexican police officials, showed up at his clinic in flowered shirts, straw hats  and sunglasses. While the FBI raided his clinic, Keller hid in a cottage nearby.  Knowing that it was just a matter of time until someone found him there, Keller  and his nurse casually walked  out the door, past the clinic and up the beach, laughing and cutting up, as  if they were lovers. Keller later heard that the FBI had been hunting for him  all over Baja. 
<p>
Although Keller decided to stay in Mexico, the rest of 1984  turned out to be a disaster. He was forced to abandon his clinic. Maxine Lowder  was convicted of failure to report a felony (she subsequently spent 19 months  in the federal prison at Pleasanton, Calif.), and without his contact in the United  States, Keller lost track  of all his patients. 
<p>
In late 1984, Keller set up his clinic again. This time  he located it in a poor hillside neighborhood in Tijuana. Although temporarily  beyond the reach of the FBI (one senior Mexican police official had, according  to Keller, warned the FBI that if he caught agents harassing Keller in Mexico  again, he'd throw them into jail), Keller was hardly home free. Because of the  now well-advertised indictment against him, and the fact that his clinic generated  large amounts of cash, he  had become a walking target of opportunity. 
<p>
In the fall of 1985, two Mexican  policemen picked up Keller and his nurse, Junie Douglas, and literally tried  to push them across the border (Keller gave them $2,500 to let them go). Two years  later, he was attacked by men carrying a machete and a nightstick. There was  so much blood on the walls that a rumor went around that he had been beheaded.  And in 1989, Keller was kidnaped and robbed by two Mexican police officers, one  of whom carried a pistol and  the other a sawed-off shotgun. Finally, on March 18, 1991, Keller was dragged  out of his office by Mexican immigration and turned over to the FBI to stand trial  on the wire fraud charges. 
<p>
To head his defense team, Keller hired Gerald  Goldstein, a highly esteemed, curly-haired San Antonio attorney who, only days  before the start of the trial, had been named Lawyer of the Year by the National  Assn. of Criminal Defense Lawyers. A virtuoso when it came to illegal-search  cases, he had recently persuaded  a Colorado judge to dismiss five felony counts of sexual assault and drug and  weapons possession against gonzo journalist Hunter Thompson. Afterward, a grateful  Thompson described him in Rolling Stone as a "maestro of motions." 
<p>
The  easiest part of Keller's defense was disproving the government's contention  that the L-Arginine serum used by Keller was "ineffective as a  cancer  treatment."  To refute that assertion, one of Keller's attorneys (he had five) put several  health researchers on the stand.  They testified that computer searches of the standard medical databases showed  some 20 to 25 articles, several of which were done at the National  Cancer   Institute itself, demonstrating that L-Arginine either prevented cancerous tumors  in the first place or, in the case of existing tumors, made them significantly  shrink or disappear entirely. The papers ranged from a 1943 study showing  that in 83% of the animals tested, rat tumors disappeared within two to three  weeks when injected with L-Arginine,  to a 1991 Lancet study showing that when human volunteers were injected with  large doses of L-Arginine over a three-day period, their "natural killer-cell  activity rose a mean of 91%."  If L-Arginine is so good for treating  cancer,   asked the judge, why don't more doctors use it? 
<p>
It was a good question,  and one answer, suggested Bryan Smith Finkle, a pharmacologist-toxicologist from  the University of Utah Medical Center who led the successful development of human  growth hormone, was one of  economics. FDA approval of a new  cancer  drug traditionally took seven to 10  years and cost the manufacturer $80 million to $120 million. 
<p>
This is why the  drug companies don't want to have anything to do with L-Arginine, Keller later  said. "They have to make a profit for their stockholders. So they go after the  things that are profitable." No drug company is going to jump the hurdles of  FDA approval for a common amino acid you couldn't even get a patent on. 
<p>
Before  the trial started, Keller supporters  had been alarmed by Judge Vela, a heavy-set, round-faced man with thinning,  slicked-back hair and large Lyndon Johnson ears that gave him the look of  an unreconstructed south-Texas cracker. In fact, he was a genial, grandfatherly  Latino with an open, fair attitude and unabashed curiosity. As the trial progressed,  he became so interested in alternative-health-care issues that at times  he would interrupt the attorneys and question the witnesses himself. 
<p>
Assistant  U.S. Attorney Mosbacker was  fuming. The defense put on a Stanford professor of engineering to testify that  the Digitron machine was a "radionics" device that worked like "instrumented  prayer" in "another dimension" using "subtle energy" at the "level of the mind."  And yet when Mosbacker objected to letting what he regarded as drivel into the  trial record, the judge hushed him with a wave and leaned over his bench to  chat with the professor in a friendly, informal way, the two of them talking like  a couple of old codgers sipping  root beer on a wooden bench outside the general store. 
<p>
Bill Moore, an longtime  Savannah lawyer who handled the examination of the witnesses regarding  L-Arginine and radionics, was elated. "This judge lets in triple hearsay. We've  got a golden window of opportunity." 
<p>
Other people were not so sure. The prosecution  was careful to keep the focus of the trial narrow and limited to specific  charges of fraud: Keller promised people a  cancer  cure, took their money  and then failed to deliver ("All  his patients died"). 
<p>
And the defense had to admit that the great majority  of Keller's patients from those early Matamoros days had, in fact, died by the  summer of 1991. Not that anyone (except, maybe, Mosbacker) really blamed Keller.  By Keller's reckoning, perhaps as many as 95% of the patients were terminal  by the time they first walked in the door. That's the reason they had gone to  Mexico in the first place. Their own doctors had given up on them. They'd had so  much radiation and toxic chemotherapy  that their immune systems were shot, their inner organs destroyed. Of  course, Keller couldn't save such people; no one could. What he could do was reduce  their tumors, relieve their pain and, as in the case of Brenda Laughlin, make  their remaining days more rewarding. 
<p>
Laughlin had originally come to see  Keller expecting to live just another few weeks. In fact, she lived 2 1/2 years,  and had a baby in the interim. When she did die, it was from pneumonia, not   cancer.  Most people would have  gladly paid thousands of dollars for a chance to bear a child and live an extra  2 1/2 years. "I never charged her anything," said Keller. Although Mosbacker  portrayed him as a money-grubbing fraud, perhaps as many as one-third of his  patients never paid anything at all, Keller said, and many more paid less than  the standard charge of $3,000 for three weeks. Keller gave food to some patients  and even allowed people to stay in his apartment so they wouldn't have to rent  a motel room. Once, when he accidentally  overcharged a woman, he mailed her a refund. "Let's face it," Goldstein  told the jury. "Do con artists send money back? When was the last time you  got a refund from a doctor?" 
<p>
As for the notion that all Keller's patients  died, the evidence presented by Mosbacker appeared to the defense as, at the very  least, highly selective. Among the 20 people whose death certificates were introduced  into evidence were people who died from a gunshot wound, a stroke and  chickenpox. Besides, these were  people Keller had treated eight years ago, some of them elderly people who might  have been expected to die even without  cancer.  "In conventional medicine,"  Goldstein said, "if you have a patient live five years, they call it a cure.  Yet his patients are expected to live forever." 
<p>
The toughest defense issue,  however, was whether Keller had promised a cure. The prosecution had put on a  dozen witnesses who said Keller had told them (or their now-deceased relatives)  they were "cured" or " cancer   free" or that "the poison has left your body." 
<p>
In response, the defense put  on nearly two dozen other vigorous, healthy former patients, mostly from Keller's  Tijuana years, all of whom stoutly denied that Keller ever used the word cure,  as well as Keller himself who said: "I bless (the prosecution witnesses),  and I hope God blesses them. I sure tried to help them. I didn't say cure. I said  the (Digitron) machine had 'zeroed out.' " 
<p>
Well, what about all the witnesses  who said you had promised  them a cure? Mosbacker asked. "All these people are lying?" 
<p>
"No," said Keller,  "they are good people." It was just that when people are desperate, they tend  to hear what they want to hear. 
<p>
As prosecutor, Mosbacker got the final  word at the trial. And on this occasion he made the most of it. He readily conceded  that many patients felt better for a brief period after they went to Keller,  but that had nothing to do with Keller's ability to do anything about their   cancer.  Keller, Mosbacker said,  was simply giving them blood transfusions to invigorate them, medicine to mask  their pain and diuretics to shrink their tumors. 
<p>
"If Keller has treated  thousands of persons, why can't he bring you in one person he has cured?" Mosbacker  asked. Then he answered his own question: "There aren't any." 
<p>
Forget all  the extraneous stuff about Digitron mind machines, subtle waves and the alleged  ability of L-Arginine to shrink tumors in rats, Mosbacker told the jurors,  and instead take a last, hard look  at Keller's numbers. "Out of 103 patients, 91 are dead, three claim to be cured,  and the rest have  cancer.  (The defense) didn't even bring in a single person  who was cured." 
<p>
Sitting at the defense table, Keller was practically  apoplectic. How could the prosecutor get away saying that he couldn't produce anyone  who was ever cured when the witness room was full of them? The prosecutor  had contended that they didn't count, that they hadn't had biopsies to prove they  were better. But no doctor  did biopsies on obviously healthy patients, Keller said. And besides, Keller's  son, Jimmy Jr., would later say, in many cases the tumors had disappeared. "What  are you going to biopsy? The place the tumor used to be before it went down?"  
<p>
The case went to the jury at noon Sept. 2. The judge's instructions to the  jurors, mostly young Latinas, were stunningly favorable to the defense ("awesome,"  actually, Goldstein would later say). Among other things, the judge told them,  it didn't matter if Keller's  treatment didn't actually help anyone. If he merely believed he was helping  people, he wasn't guilty of fraud. 
<p>
Even so, it was hard to predict what the  jury would do. Frequent peals of laughter spilled from the jury deliberation room  as Keller's friends and family waited anxiously in the courtroom nearby. No  one knew what the laughter meant; there was no way to interpret it. 
<p>
After  three hours, to everyone's astonishment, the jury announced that it had reached  a verdict. Goldstein was hopeful  as the individual jurors filed into the courtroom. Many were smiling, and some  even looked him in the eye. Then the clerk started to read the verdicts -- "Count  number one -- guilty! Count number two -- guilty! Count number . . . ." 
<p>
"Oh  no!" gasped one of Keller's former patients. Jimmy Jr. and his wife, Suzanne,  fell weeping into each other arms, and Guy Keller, Jimmy's frail and elderly  father, stumbled out of the courtroom in a daze: "Something is radically wrong."  
<p>
The jurors left the courtroom  immediately after delivering the verdict, ran to their cars and -- tires  squealing -- shot out of the parking lot. The one juror I was able to catch  said she'd based her decision on the "uniformity" of the testimony. One after another,  the prosecution witnesses all said Keller had promised to cure them, she  said. "Where would they all get that," she asked, "if he hadn't told them?" 
<p>
Later,  back at their hotel, Keller's family and friends stood around in small  stunned knots wondering why not  even a single juror found any merit to Jimmy's side of the story. "The jury  doesn't know what they've done," said one patient. "They've condemned hundreds  of people to death." 
<p>
For his part, Keller assigned most of the blame to his  attorney, Gerald Goldstein: He didn't attack the prosecution witnesses; he delivered  a far less impressive summation than his reputation might have warranted;  he wasn't familiar enough with the facts to effectively counter the prosecution's  case. "If I had defended myself,  I would have done a lot better," Keller said. "I couldn't have done worse."  
<p>
Goldstein would later take strong exception to the notion that he hadn't  done his homework or otherwise earned his fee (The total bills for all five defense  lawyers, plus expenses, ran to $500,000 -- Keller's life savings plus a  defense fund). The real problem, Goldstein said, was that the jury "never got on  board. They were watching a different movie." Then there was the near insurmountable  problem of having to explain  the Digitron machine. "Two weeks is not enough time to convince a south Texas  jury that you can cure  cancer  at a distance with a Polaroid photograph."  
<p>
Keller's sentencing was scheduled for last Thursday, Dec. 12. He was looking  at 55 years -- five years apiece on each of 11 counts -- a fact that appalled  former patients such as Olga Quijano. The people who went to St. Jude's weren't  duped, she said. They'd had conventional therapy and it hadn't worked. They  went to Keller of their own free  will. "We have freedom of choice in abortion," said Quijano, whose own therapy  had been cut off by Keller's arrest. "Why can't we have freedom of choice in   cancer  therapy, too?" 
<p>
"Choice is only half the story," answered quackbuster  William Jarvis a few weeks after the trial. "What about accountability? Practicing  medicine is not a right. It's a privilege. To allow incompetent or untrustworthy  people to practice medicine would be irresponsible. We don't do it with  plumbers or auto mechanics or  anybody else. Why should we do it with health care?" 
<p>
It was a reasonable question,  and perhaps the most eloquent response came from another of Keller's former  patients, Selma Meyers, one morning at a breakfast table in the deserted  lobby of McAllen's Compri Hotel. 
<p>
Meyers is a regal-looking woman of 68 with  smooth, pink skin, a sharp aquiline nose and a slow, dignified way of moving her  head that is reminiscent either of a great stage actress or someone who is in  very deep pain. 
<p>
"Five years  ago," she said, "I came down with inoperable breast  cancer. " Her doctor had  scheduled her for a double mastectomy at Kaiser, Woodland Hills only to change  her mind at the last minute. She'd taken Meyers' case to two different  cancer   review panels, and they both agreed: The  cancer  had metastasized; surgery  wouldn't help. Let the woman die in peace. 
<p>
Having nothing to lose, Meyers went  St. Jude's in Tijuana. After three weeks' treatment, the tumor disappeared  completely and stayed in remission  for four years. Then, two years ago, the  cancer  came back on the other side:  a purple, bleeding tumor, seeping pus. It was more difficult this time, but  Keller slowly shrunk that one till it disappeared as well. But last February,  for the third time, a tumor came back. Meyers called his clinic to make arrangements  for additional treatment, but it was too late. Four thugs, Olga Quijano told  her, had just dragged Keller out the door. 
<p>
All the time Meyers and I were  talking, she had been holding  herself perfectly still. Suddenly she stiffened -- head erect, eyes closed. It  was then that I noticed a small, red stain spreading on her blouse above her  left breast. 
<p>
Meyers' husband, Sam, was sitting with us. "This is too important  to be modest about," he told her. 
<p>
Slowly, Selma unbuttoned the top of her  blouse and carefully pulled the corner back. There on the chest wall above her  left breast was a big red and yellow, cracked and pus-encrusted mass. The technical name was infiltrating intraductal  carcinoma -- but it looked as though someone had just taken a pound  of raw hamburger, made a crude ball and pressed it against her chest. Even as I  stared, a trickle of blood began seeping from a fissure in the top and running  down the side. 
<p>
As the tears welled up in her eyes, Selma Meyers gingerly covered  the tumor with a napkin and rebuttoned her blouse. There was nothing the  doctors could do, she said. "We've been told we are dying. Jimmy is our only hope."

<TITLE>PinochlePoker.html</TITLE>Pinochle-Poker<BR>Pinochle-Poker
 is a poker
 game in the spirit of the game of Pinochle.  It is played with a regular poker
 deck (without jokers).<BR>The Game:  7-card stud poker, High-Low, English style.
  Each player is dealt two cards face down and one card face up.  There is
 a round of betting.  Two more face-up cards are dealt with a round of betting
 after each one.  Each active player may elect to discard <CITE>one</CITE> card
 and replace it from the deck, as
 in draw poker.  The drawn card is dealt face up or down according to the discarded
 card.  There is then a fourth betting round, after which each player may
 discard and draw one more card as before.  With each player still having only five
 cards, there is a final betting round before the showdown.  Betting limit doubles
 after the first draw.<BR>Wildcards:  Queen of spades  and Jack of diamonds
  are wild for determining the <CITE>high hand only</CITE>.  <BR>Special Hand:
  Queen of spades  and Jack of
 diamonds (a Pinochle) is a special hand that ranks under a full house but beats
 a flush for <CITE>high hands only</CITE>.<BR>Low hand:  The low hand pot goes
 to the &quot;lowest&quot;  of spades  in the hole, if there is one, else it goes
 to the lowest hand.  Aces count as high or low; straights and flushes swing
 (<CITE>may</CITE> be used as low).  Note that the lowest  of spades  in the hole
 excludes 2 of spades  through 8 of spades, which are not found in a Pinochle
 deck, and that the 10 of spades
  does not follow the 9 of spades  since Pinochle ranks cards differently than
 Poker.  The low spades, in ascending order, are exactly as follows:  9 of spades,
 Jack of spades, Queen of spades, King of spades, 10 of spades, Ace of spades.<BR><BR><BR>Straight
 Flush - Five cards of the same suit in sequence (e.g. 6 of
 spades, 7 of spades, 8 of spades, 9 of spades, 10 of spades )<BR>Four of a kind
 <BR>Full House - Three cards of one rank, two of another (e.g. 8-8-8-4-4)<BR>Flush
 - Five cards of the same
 suit, but not in sequence<BR>Straight - Five cards in sequence, but not all of
 the same suit<BR>Three of a kind<BR>Two pairs<BR>One Pair<BR>

<a href="#TOC"><IMG SRC="graphics/M100Med.gif" align=left hspace=5 border=0></a>
<p><center><h1>John Dobson of The Sidewalk Astronomers</h1></center>
John Dobson is a co-founder of The Sidewalk Astronomers, a pioneering builder of telescopes, and a teacher.  His theories in physics and cosmology boldly break new ground and significantly challenge the scientific orthodoxy.  John Dobson's scientific musings are very thought provoking and, like Einstein's Relativity, require us to re-examine our view of many things.
<p>
Like many scientists, Dobson is not a materialist.  He believes that it is a mistake, encouraged by our genetics, to view the Universe as material.  In his view, the Universe is apparitional.  He also makes convincing arguments against the existence of the photon (using Einstein's theory of relativity) and debunks the Big Bang theory.  In place of the Big Bang, Dobson presents a Steady State model which more accurately and more simply describes observed cosmological phenomena.
<p>
John Dobson, who recently celebrated his 80th birthday, is a man of humble means who finances his work by conducting Cosmology and Telescope Making classes.  His work is not supported by any large research organization.  This grassroots approach frees John from the scientific orthodoxy which handicaps many scientists today.  
<p>
<strong>Webmaster's note:</strong> Most of John's writings exist only in paper form and are not currently in computer readable form.  We are in the process of scanning and OCR'ing his writings, but this will take some time to complete.  We are working to bring them online as soon as possible.  This web site is constructed and maintained as a public service by MagicPubs at no cost to John Dobson or The Sidewalk Astronomers.

<center><h1>About The Sidewalk Astronomers</h1></center>
The Sidewalk Astronomers are a group of amateur astronomers who build telescopes and take them to public places beckoning passersby to come have a look at the heavens.  They do this with no profit motive in mind; it is purely for the satisfaction of sharing the wonders of the heavens with others.  If you want to know more about the The Sidewalk Astronomers, you may wish to visit their web sites: <a href="http://members.aol.com/raycash/sidewalk.htm" target="extern">San Francisco</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/6389/" target="extern">Los Angeles</a>.  On our site here, there are two papers by John Dobson, "<a href="WatchersOfSkies.html">Watchers of the Skies</a>" and "<a href="DeathValleyDeadStars.html">Dying Stars Viewed From Death Valley</a>", which will give you some insight into what motivated John to become involved with the Sidewalk Astronomers.

<center><h1>About John Dobson</h1></center>
John Dobson, co-founder of the Sidewalk Astronomers and builder of telescopes, is a groundbreaking thinker and teacher.  He was featured in the PBS television series "The Astronomers", has been written up several times in "Sky and Telescope" magazine, twice appeared on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, and has been interviewed many times for radio programs on stations such as Oregon Public Broadcasting.  His theories in physics and cosmology boldly break new ground and significantly challenge the scientific orthodoxy.  John Dobson is perhaps best known for his work in the design and construction of telescopes, however, as most telescopes made today use what is known as a "Dobsonian" mount. 
<p>
John Dobson's scientific musings are very thought provoking and, like Einstein's Relativity, require us to re-examine many of our long-held views.  While many leading scientists accept the Big Band model without question, Dobson does not.  After examining the theory, Dobson concluded it was fatally flawed and has been debunking the Big Bang ever since.  He predicts that the Big Bang will fall out of favor within this decade.  In place of the Big Bang, Dobson presents a Steady State model which more accurately describes observed cosmological phenomena.  His model does not suffer the flaws of its Steady State predecessors which were popular before the Big Bang theories.  The Dobson Steady State model is simple and elegant.  It is simpler than the various Big Bang theories and if we apply the Law of Parsimony (aka Occam's Razor), the Dobson model clearly wins due to its greater simplicity.
<p>
Like many scientists, Dobson is not a materialist.  He admits that our desire to view the world as made up of indestructible matter, tiny billiard balls at the subatomic level, is very strongly instilled in us.  But he believes that it is a mistake, encouraged by our genetics, to view the world this way.  In his view and words, the "Universe is apparitional."  For those familiar with the television series <cite>Star Trek:  The Next Generation, </cite> Dobson's view is that the Universe is similar to a holographic projection on the Holodeck.  Objects and people on the Holodeck are seemingly made of solid matter, but that is only an illusion.  It is important to note that Dobson himself does not make this Holodeck analogy; he watches very little television and is unfamiliar with the newer Star Trek series.
<p>
No brief biography of John Dobson would be complete without mentioning the fact that he spent 27 years in a Vedanta monastery.  Since leaving the monastery, he continues to live a spartan, unpretentious lifestyle.  He is compelled to share the beauty of the universe with others, expecting nothing in return save the joy of sharing, and does so by setting up telescopes in public places beckoning passersby to come look through the telescope, and by conducting classes and public lectures.

<center><h1>Complexifications</h1></center></a>
Is the apparent trend toward complexity in nature directed by a divinity, or an inevitable consequence inherent in the structure of the cosmos?  In this paper, John Dobson explains how this trend could be a natural process which does not require a divine hand, however in so doing he has laid the groundwork supporting the notion that the cosmos itself may be divine.  In this paper, Dobson discusses the apparitional nature of the universe, the creation of living organisms and ego, and genetic programming.

In this paper, John Dobson discusses the apparitional nature of the universe and why we are fooled into viewing it in a Newtonian-mechanistic way.  This paper is multidisciplinary and should be of interest to anyone interested in the subjects of anthropology, cosmology, genetic programming, relativity theory, sociology, quantum mechanics, or religion.  Of this paper, Dobson wrote the following abstract:
<blockquote>
Modern  cosmologists usually take non-existence for granted and hope to get the Universe out of nothing. But must we assume that in the absence of the Universe and  in the absence of space and time there would be nothing? Or can we, without so  rash an assumption, find clues  to what might remain if instead we take existence for granted but leave out space  and time? Could what remains, through apparition or "maya," appear  as this Universe? Can we, from what remains, get a Universe of gravity, electricity  and inertia?

This paper is John Dobson's response to a Questionnaire from the 1993 Parliament of Religions.  In it he discusses the origin of the universe, life, and homo sapiens.  He also discusses the relationship between religion and science.  Topics deal with cosmological, biological and philosophical issues:  Steady State vs. Big Bang theory, the Cosmic Expansion and the Background Radiation, the Origin of Life, Sentiency, Intelligence, Homo Sapiens, Tools, Language, Science and Religion.

In this paper John Dobson briefly discusses the nature of light.  He begins with a brief history of the scientific quest to understand light starting with Newton.  Dobson discusses why Einstein's relativity theory, in effect, says that photons do not exist.  He concludes by suggesting an anti-existentialist view of existence.  This paper is very brief and Dobson does not fully develop his ideas on the nature of photons nor his anti-existentialist views.

<br>
On a warm, spring day in 1974 I planned a visit to the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. But I never made it inside because a collection of telescopes set up on its front portico caught my attention. All had strange but simple altazimuth mountings, and all were pointed at the Sun. In their midst stood a few amateur astronomers led by a frail-looking man in his late 50s, who was explaining the miracle of sunspots to a watching crowd. Then I realized that this shirtless man with a ponytail was none other than the telescope-making wizard John Dobson.
<p>
Since there were more telescopes than people to run them, I offered to help. The next two hours were a revelation, as I watched Dobson and his San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers in action. "Our only reason for being is to show the sky to the people," Dobson told me. "Let other clubs do research with fancy telescopes. We want to share the sky with everyone."
<p>
Dobson religiously believes in making telescopes with the simplest materials and by the simplest procedures. He is like the 19th-century American naturalist and author Henry David Thoreau, who opened his masterpiece, <cite> Walden,</cite> &nbsp by borrowing an axe so he could begin work on his pondside home. But Dobson takes the <cite> Walden </cite> &nbsp concept a step further, because he uses his simple creation to show the universe to as many people as care to look.
<p>
"I want a telescope in every driveway, on every sidewalk!" he trumpets. "We don't make telescopes for us to use in our backyards and then go to bed," he snaps. "We make simple scopes for the people to use."
<p>
And that is the heart of the Dobson Revolution.
<p>
<h3> THE MAN AND HIS PHILOSOPHY </h3>
<p>
Eighty years ago this September 14th, Dobson was born in Beijing, China. His father was then teaching zoology at Beijing University. In 1927 the Dobson family, including his parents and three brothers, moved to the United States. They stopped briefly in San Francisco, intending to move on, but because of lack of funds  --  a circumstance that would become Dobson's lifelong badge of pride -- the family stayed there.
<p>
In the fertile environment of Golden Gate Park, Dobson's parents provided their children with most of their schooling. In 1934 Dobson enrolled at the University of California in Berkeley. In his book <cite> How and Why To Make a User-Friendly Sidewalk Telescope,</cite> &nbsp Dobson reveals that he did this "for the sole purpose of finding out how to keep Einstein alive." From those early days, Dobson became interested in cosmology, and he believed that Einstein was our best hope to "get the cosmos figured out."
<p>
After several interruptions in his schooling -- which included joining the Carol Beals dance group, which specialized in politically motivated dramatizations -- Dobson graduated in 1943 with a degree in chemistry and mathematics. He quickly found jobs in war-related fields at Caltech and at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory.
<p>
On May 8, 1944, his life utterly changed course. On that day Dobson entered a Vedanta monastery, part of the Ramakrishna religious order. Located near the San Francisco marina, the monastery ran a strict daily schedule that began with rising at 4:45 a.m. for worship, study, and meditation. During his stay, Dobson increased his efforts to understand how the universe ticked. He believed that contemplating the universe would not be complete without seeing it in detail. The question "Why do we see what we see?" has occupied Dobson's mind since his youth. By the early 1950s Dobson decided to make a telescope so he could at least see more of the universe for himself.
<p>
His first telescope combined an achromalic lens of 14-inch focal length with an eyepiece scrounged from an old pair of binoculars. The 37x telescope was a start, but by 1956 Dobson wanted something bigger. He remembered a 12-inchwide porthole glass lying on a friend's tabletop -- maybe used as a trivet --  and offered lo turn it into a telescope.
<p>
With the help of Allyn Thompson's book <cite> Making Your Own Telescope,</cite> &nbsp Dobson soon completed the instrument and turned it on the last-quarter Moon. Our neighbor in space looked so close he felt he was about to land on it. He immediately formed a principle that would guide him for the next four decades: If you own a telescope, it is your duty to share it with people who don't.
<p>
Despite the rigors of monastic life, Dobson began making telescopes for others. He'd use whatever materials he could find -- even the bottom of a gallon jug was good raw material for a mirror. For abrasive, he'd collect sand and separate it by size -- just as William Herschel had -- with mesh screens he designed himself. And from available gardening supplies he made polishing rouge. Two years later Dobson was transferred to another monastery, in Sacramento, where he continued building telescopes.
<p>
On some clear evenings Dobson would sneak out of the monastery and roam the nearby streets with his 12-inch 1/7 telescope perched atop a station wagon, to offer passersby a glimpse of the heavens. If a youngster showed serious interest in the sky, Dobson would speak to the child's parents and offer to lend them the telescope free for a month. Eventually he helped some of these people make their own telescopes  -- all while AWOL from the monastery. He knew he was jeopardizing his career doing this. "Either I could tell these kids to go to hell," he figured, "or risk getting thrown out of the monastery. I wasn't going to tell them to go to hell."
<p>
By the time he had finished fifteen 12-inch and two IX-inch telescopes for various households, the monastery, which had grown suspicious of his frequent absences, discovered his nocturnal activities. Dobson was warned to give up telescope making or face expulsion. He desperately wanted to stay, but eventually he was asked to leave (S&T: November 1989, page 530).
<p>
Dobson never lost his monastic spirit; in fact, he continued to live the spartan way in the outside world. He slept on a friend's rug, ate sparsely, and every clear night set up his 12-inch telescope he named Stellatrope at the corner of Jackson and Broderick Streets. Soon he began giving lectures on telescope making, first at a local Jewish Community Center and later at various places in the Bay Area.
<p>
The first telescope Dobson made didn' t fare well. Rumor has it that the monastery's abbot, Swami Ashokananda, ordered the telescope disposed of and allegedly had it tossed into San Francisco Bay. That was a tragic night for amateur astronomy.
<p>
<h3> THE SIDEWALK ASTRONOMERS </h3>
<p>
In 1968 Dobson and Bay Area amateurs Bruce Sams and Jeff Roloff started a new kind of astronomy club. The San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers, as it was called, would do no research and hold no formal meetings -- its sole purpose was to share the sky with the public (S&T: April 1980, page 338).
<p>
Eventually the club acquired an aging school bus, dubbed <cite> Starship Centaurus A.</cite> &nbsp For nearly a decade it served as the roving club's bedroom and telescope storage shed. The bus died in 1978 during the return trip from a star party at the Grand Canyon. Fortunately, the growing fame and reputation of the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers led the Skaggs Foundation to award them a modern motor home. With these more comfortable quarters the group continued its raison d'etre: "have telescopes, will travel."
<p>
Pamela Reid, the secretary of the Sidewalk Astronomers' Los Angeles branch, fondly recalls the day in 1979 when Dobson set up a telescope in the front yard of a local church. Several years later he also helped Reid finish her 8-inch mirror. She was impressed at how quickly Dobson diagnosed the mirror's condition. "I watched him turn my disastrous attempt at mirror grinding into a success in 35 minutes," she says. "He just knew what the mirror's problems were."
<p>
Dobson had to struggle to get his telescope-making and testing methods accepted by the larger amateur community. His earliest attempts were rebuffed. <cite> Sky & Telescope's </cite> &nbsp founding father, Charles A. Federer Jr., for example, doubted in 1969 that Dobson's simple plywood mountings and lightbulbtesting procedures would be of any use to serious observers. Federer missed Dobson's point. Dobson was not after perfection -- he was after the simplicity with which practically anybody could build, own, or use a big scope.
<p>
But once the design caught on, it was Dobson himself who did the underestimating. At all major star parties these days the Dobson-type telescope is by far the most common. At Florida's Winter Star Party each year, many stand like trees in a spot now called the Valley of the Dobs (S&T: August 1995, page 107).
<p>
What defines a Dobsonian telescope? Dobson, by the way, objects to the moniker. He says applying his own name to a class of telescope is anathema to him, quipping, "Cassegrain, Schmasse-grain! Maksutov, Schmaksutov! Dobsonian, Schmobsonian!" He believes Richard Berry first coined the term "Dobsonian" in <cite> Telescope Making.</cite>
<p>
A <cite> sidewalk telescope,</cite> &nbsp as Dobson calls his creation, is not just any telescope with a plywood-box altazimuth mount. It is a Newtonian reflector with a lightweight mirror, usually made of porthole glass. The mounting uses plywood and Teflon strips to ease the motions in azimuth and altitude.
<p>
The original 12-inch sidewalk telescope used roof shingles to support the secondary. Its tube was made of readily available materials. For example, since Dobson could not afford a Sonotube, he used the cardboard cores of discarded garden-hose reels. Each reel core was 22 inches long. If it took three such cores to fashion a tube, Dobson would call it a

three-barrel 12-incher. Today, most of the telescope tubes are converted Sonotubes.
<p>
Some people say that Dobson's approach encourages sloppiness. The idea of using inexpensive lightbulbs to test a mirror might appear to work in principle but leads to inaccurate results in practice. Dobson counters that argument by saying that he and his sidewalk astronomers are interested in public service, not laser testing and technogadgetry.
<p>
<h3> CHEERS, JOHN!</h3>
<p>
On September 2nd Dobson's beloved Sidewalk Astronomers plan to toast him with a big celebration at San Francisco's Randall Museum (see facing page). With sidewalk telescopes all over the place, the people of San Francisco, with flowers in their hair and stars in their eyes, will look at the universe that Dobson has been trying to comprehend all his life. And on that night he will do what he always does: he will ask people to look, and to think. It doesn't matter that they might not agree with him, but it does matter that they think about it. What better way to celebrate a man's dream?

<br>
One of the problems of human knowledge is that the world which we see from the surface of this planet on a sunny day bears almost no resemblance to the Universe at large. Our Earth is made of iron and rock, but the Universe as a whole is mostly hydrogen. The actions which we see on the surface of this Earth run mostly on sunlight, but the Universe runs on gravity. What we see here are continents, oceans, rivers and lakes, mountain ranges, forests, tundra and prairies. But the Universe at large is mostly gas, partly condensed by gravity to galaxies and stars, and lightly sprinkled, here and there, with interstellar dust. The dust is made from hydrogen in the bellies of the stars, and is scattered through the galaxies by the explosions and the stellar winds of stars much bigger and much hotter than our Sun. But the dust is scarce, and, like our bodies, the rock on which we live is made of these dusts. It is a collector's item. The heavier elements, such as iron, have sunk to the center, overlaid with the rocks of the mantle and the crust and a thin veneer of water and gas. Since the age of this museum piece is pushing five billion years, by now the water-soluble compounds of the surface rocks have leached into the water layer, making the oceans salty. The saltiness of our blood is the saltiness of the ancient sea, some four hundred million years ago. That is when our scaly ancestors, on stumpy fins, crawled out across the land in search of other water and the sight of other fish. Descended as we are from them, we can think of our bodies, even now, as little bags of sea water, hung out on clotheslines of bone, gulping oxygen directly from the gas layer above us, and shambling out across the rocks to gaze with starry eyes, through the blackness of night, at the vast expanse of the Universe beyond.
<p>
Even the oxygen that we breathe is freed by sunlight through the instrumentality of our photosynthetic relatives, first by the blue-green algae in the sea, and now by the green leaves of the rain forest. Even the rain is driven by sunlight. But the Universe at large has a reducing atmosphere, and it is without rain and without sunlight. It is very cold, very dark, and very lonely, trying desperately to fall together by the seemingly inexplicable attraction of the particles for each other. Even the radiation of the Sun is driven by this attraction which has pushed the central temperature of the Sun up to some fifteen million degrees Celsius. And it is only because its gravitational collapse has been slowed by the nuclear fusion at its core that the Sun has bathed our Earth with its warming rays for nearly five billion years. Only this delay has made possible our long genetic development till we were able to climb out of the water and gaze in wonder at the starry sky of night. Although we, as living organisms, owe both our existence and our long genetic development to the Sun, its dazzling brightness prevents us from seeing the Universe by day. The blueness of the daytime sky is not the color of the air, but simply the shorter wavelengths scattered from the sunlight by the gas layer above us. And that gas layer by night, unlit by the Sun, is sufficiently transparent so that through it we may gaze into the far reaches of the Universe.
<p>
But seeing alone is not enough. It is only the beginning. We must also understand what we see, and that has a history. Understanding rests on a foundation of concepts and information coming down to us from the past, albeit not the very distant past. It is not from the first few hundred million years after we came ashore in the swamps to look around, because in those distant days and nights the concepts which we framed, and the information which we gained, could not be transmitted from generation to generation. We lacked a mechanism to transmit it. It is not transmitted genetically, and there were then no words. The written word, by which concepts and information are largely transmitted in what we proudly think of as the "Age of Science," are only a few thousand years old. And vocal speech itself is fairly new. It was probably forced upon us by the failure of our body language in the surf when we, as brachiating primates, marooned on an island in northeast Africa, were driven by drought from the jungles to the beach, not more than ten or fifteen million years ago. And even the body language common to the great apes, and easily understood by the orangs, the gorillas, the chimps and ourselves, is less than fifty million years old. Our great gain in those earlier times was in our genetically transmitted capabilities. By the early demise of those with poorer eyes, we gained our visual acuity, and by the early demise of those with smaller brains, we improved our capacity to understand. It is that capacity which sets us apart amongst watchers of the skies.

<br> <br> <br>
In order to help make it possible for the people who live on this planet to see and understand the Universe in which we live, we set up our telescopes in the shopping malls or on the sidewalks of the cities so that people may see the planets and moons of our own solar system. We even have fail-safe sun telescopes for seeing the spots on the Sun. And when possible we take our larger telescopes to the national parks and monuments, to the Indian reservations, and even abroad, where people can see more distant objects through skies unlit by city lights.

"Why are the clouds so flat on the bottom?" is the wrong question to ask. The flat bottom is just the boundary between the denser dry air below and the less dense wet air above. (The molecular weight of water is only eighteen. The molecular weight of nitrogen and oxygen are twenty-eight and thirty-two because they both form diatomic molecules; so dry air is conspicuously denser than wet air and stays near the ground while the wet air floats above it.) But "Why are the clouds so lumpy on top?" is the right question to ask. And it is because of the phase change of the water. It takes eighty-one calories per gram to melt ice without any change in temperature. (A mixture of ice and water will stay at the freezing point till all the ice has melted) And it takes only another hundred to bring it to a boil at sea level. (The boiling point of water varies with the atmospheric pressure. Water will not boil until the steam pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure which at sea level on this planet is fifteen pounds per square inch.) But it takes another five hundred and forty calories to vaporize it. Now if it takes five hundred and forty calories to vaporize a gram of water, all that heat comes out again when the water vapor precipitates as droplets in a cloud. (Wet air is a mixture of water vapor and air. Steam is not a mixture. It is water vapor at or above the boiling point.  When you look at the spout of a tea kettle on the stove, you can see through the steam at the spout. Only farther out it forms a cloud. The reason that steam burns are so damaging is because five hundred and forty calories of heat are released for every gram of water that condenses on your skin.) So the precipitation of fog, cloud or rain warms the air. It's not cold in San Francisco because it's foggy; it's foggy because it's cold. And it would be colder without the fog.
<p>
So the clouds are lumpy on top because the precipitation of the water vapor to cloud heats the air and causes it to rise. And the faster a cloud dumps its rain, the faster it warms and rises. And the faster it warms and rises, the faster it dumps its rain. So if the cloud is very large and very wet then the air that comes in from below to replace the rising cloud may blow your house away.
<p> 
In the mountains the ground cools off at night by radiating. The heat energy is radiated away in the infrared to the night sky, and the air in contact with the ground cools off by this contact and flows downhill like water. That is why the clouds sometimes disappear at night. In the daytime, however, the ground is warmed by the Sun and heats the air in contact with it. So the warm moist air over the southwest slopes rises and cools till the water vapor in it precipitates out as clouds. That is why one often sees clouds forming over the mountains in the afternoon. But at night when the cloud layer is lowered, to replace the downhill breezes, the temperature and pressure rise and the clouds are vaporized.
<p>
By watching the edges of the clouds at dusk, to see if they are vaporizing, one can often tell whether or not the sky will clear at dark.
<p>
It is because the cold night air flows downhill like water that large night telescopes belong on the peaks and ridges. And it is because in the daytime the warm air goes up the slopes that sun telescopes belong elsewhere.
When a balloon goes up in the air, the air inside it gets cooler because the molecules are colliding with a receding wall. It's like a baseball. When it's bunted, it slows down because it collides with a receding bat. (Temperature is a measure of the mean kinetic energy of the molecules; so if they collide with a receding wall and slow down, they cool off.) When the balloon comes down again, the air inside heats up because the molecules are colliding with an advancing wall. It's like a baseball on a home run pitch. It collides with an advancing bat. Air going up in this way cools off with or without the wall of the balloon because, as it expands, the molecules collide with receding molecules.

<center> <h2> I.</h2></center>
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin has laid great emphasis on a very important process which he calls complexification. And if I understand him correctly, he suggests that divinity pulls us toward itself through this process of complexification. My only question here is whether the personal interference of divinity is required in this process, or whether the underlying existence showing through in matter and in living organisms is sufficient to pull the process to completion.
<p>
Although most modern cosmologists take non-existence for granted (that is, they want to get the Universe out of nothing), I am not willing to do so, nor was Teilhard. The question then arises: what would remain if we take existence for granted but leave out space and time, i.e., what could exist in the absence of a universe?
<p>
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity suggest that the world which we see in space and time is apparitional. Einstein's 1905 equations show space and time as a pair of opposites. We see events at a distance by seeing them in the past, and in just such a way that the real separation (the four dimensional separation) between the seer and the seen remains at zero. Einstein also showed in 1905 what Swami Vivekananda had asked Nikola Tesla to show ten years earlier, namely, that what we see as matter (mass) is just potential energy. And by 1926 Heisenberg had pointed out that there is a necessary uncertainty associated with seeing things in space and time. The more we can know about where and when something is, the less we can know about what it is. All this suggests that the world which we see in space and time is apparitional. 
<p>
Now if the world is indeed apparitional, then underlying it there must exist something which is not in space and time, and which must therefore be changeless, infinite and undivided (not in time, and not limited or divided by space). And since it must underlie the apparition, it must show through (just as the length and diameter of a rope show through in the snake for which it is mistaken). What I am suggesting. then, is that the underlying existence must show through as attraction, repulsion, and inertia in the physical world, and as attachment, aversion, and the clinging to life in the world of the living. 
<p>
I am therefore suggesting that the primordial hydrogen, of which the entire Universe appears to be made, shows the changelessness of the underlying existence as inertia, and that it shows the infinitude as the electrical repulsion, kinetic energy and radiation, and the undividedness as gravity and the attraction between opposites. And also, since the hydrogen is apparitional and must therefore represent zero change in the changeless, we have the conservation laws. And finally, since the Universe is seen in time and must therefore be changing, even the particles themselves (the protons and electrons) have spin. So the question here is this: <CITE>Will the nature of the underlying existence , through a process of automatic complexification, pull the atoms and molecules to life, and will the underlying existence showing through in living organisms as attachment, aversion, and clinging to life, pull the saints to final beatitude?</CITE>
<p>
First of all let me point out that sentiency is in this from the word "go". All matter discriminates up from down. And the electrical particles discriminate plus from minus and spin up from spin down. There is always a perceiver and a perceived, and sentiency is in it from the word "go".
<p>
Now even if the Universe started as nothing but hydrogen, it would nevertheless fall together by gravity to galaxies and stars. And, by processes thoroughly understood, it would complexify to other chemical elements in the stars, and in the stellar explosions which scatter the chemical elements far and wide. Then, through the discrimination of plus from minus and spin up from spin-down, in the interstellar clouds and on the surfaces of planets these chemical elements would complexify to molecules. And once again by processes which are thoroughly understood.
<p>
Subsequently, through molecular discrimination on the surfaces of planets (and by processes <CITE>not</CITE> thoroughly understood), the molecules appear to complexify to life. 
<p>
Now at this point we have a very interesting threshold, as Teilhard would call it, between the non-living and the living. A living organism must direct a stream of negative entropy upon itself to stay alive, and that requires an egoistical discrimination quite unlike the discriminations built into the hydrogen. 
<p>
As I said, this process is not well understood, but it is easy to see that egoism is a genetic invention to keep a living organism alive, and that the genetic discriminations of the ego are required for the direction of a stream of negative entropy upon the organism. It is these discriminations that take the form of attachment, aversion, and clinging to life.
<p>
If attachment, aversion, and clinging to life are simply the genetic equivalents of the attraction, repulsion, and inertia seen in matter, (because the undividedness, the infinitude and the changelessness of the underlying existence must show through), then the genetic complexifications may also be considered to be automatic.
<p>
The complexification of the genetic organisms is driven by changes in the environment and imposes complexification on the genetic discriminations.
<p>
The complexification of the genetic discriminations of the single celled organisms makes possible the genetic invention (if you like) of poly-celled organisms. And this is another Teilhardian threshold, but one which is fairly well understood. 
<p>
It is important to bear in mind at this threshold, that for simple poly-celled organisms like the sponge the complexification of the poly-celled organism itself is primitive compared to the complexification of the individual cells of which it is composed. It is also important to bear in mind that the response of the poly-celled organism to gravity, kinetic energy (temperature), radiation, electricity and magnetism, depends on the responses of the individual cells to these same forms of energy. And also, that the responses of the cells depend in turn on the responses of the atoms and molecules of which the cells are made. As I said earlier, sentiency is in this from the word "go".
<p>
It is also important to notice at this point that for poly-celled organisms like ourselves the ego of the poly-celled organism shows no recognition of the egos of the individual cells of which the poly-celled organism is composed. And this, in spite of the fact that at the time of conception each of us was a one-celled organism without a brain. 
<p>
Over a rather long period of time, environmental changes have complexified the poly-celled organisms and therefore the genetic discriminations which they are required to make. 
<p>
And one of the reasons that poly-celled organisms have become so enormously complex is that the "improved" genetic programming is usually built on top of the previous programming without an "eraser", i.e. without a mechanism for removing what went before. This leads automatically to complexification. It may be possible through neoteny to cancel the last things written in the genetic programming and replace them with new programming, but usually the new programming is superimposed on top.
<p>
Through what has come to be called "natural selection", the environmental changes on the surface of this planet have imposed bewildering sequences of genetic complexifications on the poly-celled organisms. 
<p>
It appears to me that both memory and intelligence must arise through the complexifications of the egoistic discriminations of which are driven by natural selection. And the question which arises here is, whether the genetic complexifications, like the atomic and molecular complexifications before them, are driven simply by the nature of the underlying existence showing through in space and time.
<p>
<center> <h2> II.</h2></center> It may already be obvious that the genetic complexifications heretofore discussed are sufficient to require the invention of memory and intelligence. But what may not be so obvious is what drove the particular sequence of complexifications which caused Alfred Russell Wallace to wonder whether the personal interference of divinity might not be required to explain the evolution of the human brain. He considered this quite mysterious. 
<p>
I have also to wonder whether it might not have been this same mystery which raised in Teilhard's mind the notion of the Omega Point toward which he felt divinity was pulling us as a race. 
<p>
Through the penetrating insights of the late Sir Alaster Hardy, Desmond Morris, Elaine Morgan and others, this mystery has recently been largely cleared up. It appears now that some five or ten million years ago our jungle-swinging ancestors were probably marooned on an island in Northeast Africa by the rise in ocean level consequent on the melting of the polar ice caps. 
<p>
This rather sudden and severe environmental disruption, if you like, when we exchanged the jungle for the seashore, imposed on our chimp-like ancestors the need for rapid genetic complexification, because the food was underwater at the beach. Not only was it underwater, its availability depended on the phases of the moon.
<p>
One of the complexifications which we built in at that beach was what is called neoteny, the carrying over into later life of juvenile characteristics. And I sometimes wonder whether it might have been because the adults showed more willingness to carry the juveniles on their backs when they walked out into the water at feeding time if the juveniles showed more pronounced juvenility. At any rate, neoteny allowed us to prolong and thus extend the growth of the frontal lobes of the brain. This extension would have been furthered by the use of tools and language; tools for breaking shells and speech because body language failed in the surf. 
<p>
It is perhaps a presumption on my part that once neoteny, braininess, and speech became species characteristics, they would have been picked out at mating long after we returned to mainland Africa a few million years later. 
<p>
It may also be a presumption on my part that these complexifications were built in rather quickly because the population was very small.
<p>
And neoteny allows a sort of eraser if the new programming is put in before the operation of the complete adult programming. 
<p>
Perhaps at this point I should point out that juveniles do not follow the prime directives of the genetic programming; they neither direct streams of negative entropy upon themselves nor pass on the genetic line. The parents do it for them. I believe it was the extension of this immunity through neoteny, along with the extension of our juvenile curiosity, which was largely responsible for the growth of science and religion and our human state. 
<p>
Most complex organisms such as ourselves follow headlong the suggestions of the genetic programming. But in our case, through neoteny and the complexification of the brain, we have the ability to say no to a genetic impulse. And partly because each of us has a history of childhood, when the prime directives of the genetic programming were inoperative, we have the ability to see through the genetic apparition to the underlying existence.
<p>
We have the ability, while following the genetic promptings, to notice that the fulfillment of a genetic necessity does not confer on us the fulfillment of the yearning that drives it. 
<p>
Through marriage we do not reach the undivided, nor through sleep, the changeless. 
<p>
As I see it, this discrimination between the promptings of the genetic programming and the fundamental yearning for the changeless, the infinite, the undivided which drives them is the beginning of religion. 
<p>
If this discrimination between the underlying existence and the genetic apparition can take the saints to final beatitude, we may not need to invoke the personal interference of divinity.
<p>
However, it has been found, that among the saints there are two prevailing points of view: some see the underlying existence as impersonal, and some see it as personal. 
<p>
If the underlying existence is seen as impersonal, the complexification may appear automatic. Whereas, if the underlying existence is seen as personal, this entire series of complexifications may be seen as directed.

<STRONG>Abstract</STRONG>
<br>
Modern  cosmologists usually take non-existence for granted and hope to get the Universe  out of nothing. But must we assume that in the absence of the Universe and  in the absence of space and time there would be nothing? Or can we, without so  rash an assumption, find clues  to what might remain if instead we take existence for granted but leave out space  and time? Could what remains, through apparition or <CITE>maya,</CITE> appear  as this Universe? Can we, from what remains, get a Universe of gravity, electricity  and inertia? 
<br><br><br>
<STRONG><H3>Introduction</STRONG></H3>This is the  one hundredth anniversary of the 1893 Parliament of Religions at which Swami  Vivekananda<sup><font size=-2> (1) </font></sup> so eloquently proclaimed that all religions are true and that the  proof of one is the proof of all.  He said: 
<blockquote>
 "If the Parliament of Religions has shown anything to the  world it is this: it has proved to the world that holiness, purity, and charity  are not the exclusive possessions of any church in the world, and that every system  has produced men and women of the most exalted character. In the face of  this evidence, if anybody dreams of the exclusive survival of his own religion  and the destruction of the others, I pity him from the bottom of my heart and point  out to him that upon the banner  of every religion will soon be written, in spite of resistance: 'Help and  not fight; Assimilation and not Destruction; Harmony and Peace and not Dissension'."<sup><font size=-2> (2) </font></sup> </blockquote>
It was my hope in attending this present Parliament of the  World's Religions, a hundred years after the swami's ringing words were spoken,  that the conflict between the various religions had been largely put behind us  and that we could now address the conflict between science and religion. It was  my hope that the conflict between  science and the church which reigned in terror through the Spanish Inquisition  might finally be put to rest. And I came here to say that if anyone dreams  of the exclusive survival of religion and the destruction of science, I pity him  from the bottom of my heart. And likewise, if anyone dreams of the exclusive  survival of science and the destruction of religion, I pity him from the bottom  of my heart. In my mind, the proof of one is the proof of both. 
<br><br>
Can we,  by now, square science with religion?  In particular, can we square relativity and quantum mechanics with Swami  Vivekananda's Advaita Vedanta?<sup><font size=-2> (3) </font></sup>  Since there cannot be two worlds -- one for the  scientists and one for the mystics -- it must be that their descriptions are of  the same world but from different points of view. Can we, from the vantage point  of the swami's Advaita (non-dualism), see both points of view? Swami Vivekananda  said that science and religion would meet and shake hands. Can we see things  from his vantage point? 
<br><br>
Since  the notion of maya or apparition as the first cause of our  physics is central to the swami's Advaita, I have chosen as my subject "The Equations of Maya". Can we find them in our physics? According to the philosophy  of the Advaita Vedantins, as the swami himself has said, there cannot be two  existences, only one. And maya is, as it were, a veil or screen through  which that oneness (the Absolute) is seen as this Universe of plurality and  change.

<br><br>
<STRONG><center><H1>The Equations of Maya</STRONG></center></H1>
<br><br>
First,  we have to  know what equations are. Second, we have to know what the Vedantins mean by maya.  And finally, we have to take a hard look at our physics to see  if any of our equations can be taken as descriptive of maya. 
<br><br><br>
<STRONG><H3>WHAT ARE EQUATIONS?</STRONG></H3>
So,  what are equations? They  are a kind of mathematical shorthand. They are just brief statements, usually in  symbolic form like <STRONG>2 + 2 = 4</STRONG>. If you put that in English, it reads, "two plus two  equals four." There's nothing scary about it. But essentially, there are two kinds  of equations: mathematical equations, like the one just mentioned, and the  equations of our physics. But mathematics is not about anything. Two oranges plus  two oranges equals four oranges  is about oranges, but <STRONG>2 + 2 = 4</STRONG> is not about anything. Now physics is about something;  it is about how matter behaves. So the equations of physics are about  the behavior of matter, and that's what concerns us here. Newton's famous equation, <STRONG>f = ma</STRONG>, put into words, means that the force required to accelerate an object is proportional to the product of the mass  of that object and the rate of change of its velocity. That means that when you're  pushing a car to speed it up,  how hard you have to push depends on how heavy the car is and how fast you have  to speed it up. All that is contained in that little statement, <STRONG>f = ma</STRONG>.  It's just a kind of shorthand, and it's not scary. 
<br><br><br>
<STRONG><H3>WHAT  IS MAYA?</STRONG></H3>
We've talked  a little about equations; now we have to talk about maya. What  do the Vedantins mean by maya? First, we know from the  Upanishads<sup><font size=-2> (4) </font></sup> that it is made of three <CITE>gunas: tamas, rajas,</CITE> and<CITE> sattva.</CITE> Tamas has its veiling power, <CITE>avarana shakti </CITE>in Sanskrit. Rajas has its projecting power, <CITE>vikshepa shakti</CITE>  in Sanskrit,  and sattva has its revealing power, <CITE>prakasha shakti</CITE>  in Sanskrit. Now this language, "veiling" and "revealing", is  the language of <CITE>perception, </CITE>not the language of <CITE>manufacture.</CITE>  You can't make anything  out of a guna as the Sankhyans<sup><font size=-2> (5) </font></sup> wanted to do. These three gunas,  of which maya is said to be made, are just three aspects  of a misperception. They are not substances, like wood, stone, or gold, out  of which objects could be made. They are simply three aspects of an apparition.  In order to mistake a rope for a snake, you must fail to see the rope rightly;  that's the veiling power of tamas. Then you must jump to the wrong  conclusion; that's the projecting  power of rajas. <CITE>You yourself</CITE> project the snake. But the length  and diameter of the rope are seen as the length and diameter of the snake;  that's the revealing power of sattva.  If you hadn't seen the rope,  you might have jumped to some other wrong conclusion. 
<br><br>
But many of the  Vedantins, when they write about the veiling and projecting powers of maya,  leave the revealing power out. You look in the books -- you'll find they  leave it out. But you cannot  leave it out or the theory would be lame and the Universe wouldn't run.  
<br><br>
So  we see from the Upanishads that maya is made of three gunas, that it is a misperception, a kind of magic, and that  the Universe is therefore apparitional, like the snake for which a rope has been  mistaken. But why does the apparition take the form of this Universe? Why do  we see the physics that we see? Partly it is the gunas and partly  it is space and time. 
<br><br>
Swami  Vivekananda said in one of his lectures<sup><font size=-2> (6) </font></sup> that the Universe is the Absolute  seen through the screen of time, space, and causation (<CITE>kala, desha, nimitta</CITE>).  He said that time, space, and causation are like the glass through  which the Absolute is seen, and when It is seen on the lower side, It appears  as the Universe. So not only is the Universe apparitional, it's the Absolute seen  through time and space, and that allows us to understand why the physics of  the Universe takes the form that  we see. 
<br><br>
Swami Vivekananda said that he could write a whole book on a single  statement of Sri Ramakrishna, and I could write a whole book on this single  statement of the swami. 
<br><br>
Now Swami Vivekananda's statement that the Universe  is the Absolute seen through the screen of time, space and causation allows  us to get some interesting information, albeit in negative terms, about what  he calls the Absolute. Since it is not in time, it cannot be changing. Change  takes place only in time. And  since it is not in space, it must be undivided, because dividedness and separation  occur only in space. And since it is therefore one and undivided, it must also  be infinite, since there is no "other" to limit it. Now "changeless", "infinite",  and "undivided" are negative statements, but they will suffice. We can trace  the physics of our Universe from these three negative statements. If we don't  see the Absolute as what it is, we'll see it as something else. If we don't  see it as changeless, infinite,  and undivided, we'll see it as changing, finite, and divided, since in this case  there is no other else. There is no other way to mistake the changeless except  as changing. So we see a Universe which is changing all the time, made of minuscule  particles, and divided into atoms. 
<br><br>
But because of the revealing  power, the changelessness, the infinitude, and the undividedness show through.  The changeless shows through in us as our yearning for peace and security and  it shows in what we see as matter  as its mass or inertia. The infinite shows in us as our yearning for freedom,  and it shows in what we see as matter as the electrical charge on the minuscule  particles. And the undivided shows in us as love, and it shows in what we see  as matter as gravity and the attraction between opposites like positive and negative  electrical charges. The Universe is "wound up" against gravity only because  the undividedness shows through. And it is "wound up" against electricity  only because the infinitude shows  through. Gravity, electricity, and inertia are simply the nature of the underlying  existence showing through, just as the length and diameter of the rope show  through in the snake for which it has been mistaken. What we see as energy  is simply the underlying existence showing through. Everything that happens, happens  because of that. 
<br><br>
<STRONG>Causation</STRONG>
<br>
So  we have seen, from the Upanishads, that maya is made of three gunas.  The Sankhyans  call it <CITE>prakriti,</CITE> the first cause, and we have seen that the first  cause must be apparitional. As Swami Vivekananda said, the Universe is the Absolute  seen through the screen of time, space, and causation. Here I need to say  a few words about causation, because what we ordinarily see as causation is not  apparitional. It is transformational. Chevys do not arise by apparition; they  come from Detroit. Although, as we have seen, the first cause of our physics is  apparitional, it leaves us with  a Universe wound up with energy, and the transformations run on of their own accord. <CITE>Gravity arises by apparition, but falling is transformational.</CITE>  The gravitational energy is transformed to kinetic energy without any change  in the amount. 
<br><br>
As you may know, philosophical systems, in India, are  catalogued according to their understanding of causation. The Sankhyans were Parinamavadins. They believed in <CITE>parinama,</CITE>  transformational causation, like  making milk into buttermilk. The milk is transformed into buttermilk. The Advaita  Vedantins are Vivartavadins. They believe that the first cause is <CITE>vivarta,</CITE>  apparition, like mistaking a rope for a snake. Now these are very  different things. When milk is transformed into buttermilk, it's a change that  takes place in time. It's a <CITE>happening,</CITE> and there's a shelf life  on your buttermilk. There's a date on it. But mistaking a rope for a snake is  not a happening in that sense.  It is not that you mistook the rope for a snake yesterday and now there's a snake  in your kitchen and you don't dare open the door. It's a mistake you are making now; it's something you're doing <CITE>now. </CITE>
<br><br>
<STRONG>Transformational  Causation</STRONG>
<br>
Now the rules that govern transformational  causation are very well understood at the universities. The energy that  goes into an operation at the beginning comes out at the end. Although the form  of the energy may change, you  never get any new energy that way. It's like pouring gold. You melt it and pour  it into a set of forms. Then you remelt it and pour it into another set of forms.  You never get rich that way. No matter how many times you remelt it, you never  get any new gold. Transformational causation is like that. What you put in  at the beginning comes out at the end. It is governed by the conservation laws.  Whether it's matter, energy, momentum or electrical charge -- whatever you put in  at the beginning comes out at  the end. And since the Universe is made out of energy, the changes of which are  governed by these conservation laws, the Universe cannot have arisen through  transformational causation. It cannot have come out of nothing. 
<br><br>
<STRONG>Apparitional  Causation</STRONG>
<br>
But what I have referred to as apparitional  causation is a very different thing. When you mistake a rope for a snake, the rope  is not transformed into a snake. It's just a mistake, and it's something you're  doing <CITE>now.</CITE> So  the question is not: "How did the Absolute become the Universe?" That can't be  answered. The Absolute has not become the Universe. The question is, " Why do  we see it that way? Why do we feel that we are bound? Why do we continue to make  this mistake? Why are we unable to see through the apparition?" And that can  be answered. 
<br><br>
On December 14th, 1882, Vijaykrishna Goswami asked Sri Ramakrishna  this question: "Sir, why are we bound like this? Why don't we see God?"  And Sri Ramakrishna answered: 
<blockquote>
"Maya  is nothing but the egotism of the embodied soul. This egotism has  covered everything like a veil. 'All troubles come to an end when the ego dies'.  If, by the grace of God, a man but once realizes that he is not the doer, then  he at once becomes a jivanmukta. Though living in the body, he is liberated;  he has nothing else to fear."<sup><font size=-2> (7) </font></sup>  
</blockquote><br>
<STRONG>What Is Egotism?</STRONG>
<br>
So  maya, the first cause, is made of three gunas and consists  of seeing the Absolute through  the screen of time, space, and causation -- and we continue to see it thus  because of egotism. <CITE>What is this egotism?</CITE>
<br><br>
Those  of you who have read Erwin Schrodinger's little book,<CITE> What is Life?,</CITE><sup><font size=-2> (8) </font></sup>   may already see that egotism is a genetic invention to keep a living organism  alive. The defining characteristic of a living organism is that it must be  able to direct a stream of negative entropy upon itself. It must find and use  a source of energy less scrambled  at the start. Entropy is a measure of the scrambledness of the energy. Every  living organism scrambles the energy in its environment. Negative entropy is  a measure of the usability (the unscrambledness) of the energy. We get our negative  entropy by eating and breathing. The plants get their negative entropy from  the Sun. In most transformational processes, the scrambledness of the energy  goes up. The entropy goes up. It never goes down. At least locally, entropy is  going up; the Universe is  running  down. <CITE>Every living organism must direct a stream of negative entropy  upon itself to stay alive;</CITE> so life is impossible except in a situation that  is going from bad to worse. If you want to enjoy the "good old days", do it  now! <CITE>All living organisms live in this cascade of increasing entropy by  directing streams of the increase through their forms. And egotism is a genetic  invention required by this necessity. </CITE>
<br><br>
<STRONG>Prime Directives</STRONG>
<br>
The prime  directives of the genetic programming are to direct a stream of negative entropy  upon the organism and to pass on the genetic line. And the egotism required  for the fulfillment of these prime directives is what Sri Ramakrishna referred  to as the "unripe ego". The discrimination is made between the organism and its  environment for the sake of fulfilling these directives. Sri Ramakrishna, when  speaking to men, referred to these prime directives as "woman and gold" -- "gold"  for directing a stream of negative  entropy upon the organism, and "woman" for passing on the genetic line.  When speaking to women, he said "men and gold". He often said, when speaking to  men, "maya is nothing but woman and gold." 
<br><br>
<STRONG>Genetic Programming</STRONG>
<br>
It should be noted that this language -- "genetic programming" -- was  not current in Sri Ramakrishna's day. So far as I know, some of the  first things that were published on the subject of genetics were Mendel's experiments,  and I don't think they  hit the press until 1900. But if we translate Sri Ramakrishna's remarks into  that language, they say very clearly that <CITE>maya is nothing but our genetic  programming. </CITE>
<br><br>
You remember that the question was not  how the Absolute has become the Universe, but rather why do we continue to see  it that way. And the answer is that it is because of egotism, and that egotism  turns out to be nothing but our genetic programming. It is this genetic expectation  that keeps the wool pulled  over our eyes. It is the expectation that by following the dictates of the genes  we'll reach the peace and security of the changeless, the freedom of the infinite,  and the bliss of the undivided. But that is just a genetic mirage. 
<br><br>
We  are programmed to eat, breathe, and mate. But not so fast! It goes in steps,  and the male programming for passing on the genetic line goes like this: In  the absence of females, seek females; in the presence of females, select. In the  presence of a selected female,  start a conversation. Ask her where she's from. Ask her where she's going. Ask  her out to dinner. And the rest you know. We are all descended from ancestors  who were programmed this way and who passed on the genetic line. So much for  that problem. But how about our negative entropy? 
<br><br>
<STRONG>Negative Entropy</STRONG>
<br>
We get our negative entropy by eating and breathing,  and we get it from the plants. The plants get their negative entropy from  the Sun. They make reducing agents  for their own use, and dump oxygen out as waste. We munch down the reducing  agents and huff and puff on the oxygen, and run around on the canned sunlight.  And we feel that we are the doers. It's just a genetic mirage. We are not the  doers. It is just recycled sunlight. 
<br><br>
Sometimes when you read in <CITE>The  Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</CITE> that he says that we are not the doers, you  might think that he is asking us to<CITE> pretend</CITE> that we are not the doers.  No, he never makes that kind  of mistake. He is not asking us to make-believe anything. He is asking us to  discriminate between the real and the make-believe and to let the make-believe  go. 
<br><br>
I once wrote to Swami Yogeshananda that this earth can't bloom a flower.  Without the Sun, no plants would bloom. Without the falling hydrogen, no  suns would shine. And without the entire Universe, no hydrogen would fall. I said  that this whole Universe blooms the flower. By this whole Universe, the robin  sings. <CITE>But by what blooms  this Universe?</CITE> It is the nature of the Absolute showing through in space  and time that blooms this Universe. It is the revealing power of maya.  The dream is in the dreamer,<CITE> and the dream is alive. </CITE>
<br><br>
So,  it's the genetic programming that keeps the wool pulled over  our eyes. But our genetic programming comes in batches, and that gives us a  loophole -- a genetic loophole. No other animal on the face of this planet has a  childhood like yours. 
<br>
<br>
<STRONG>Childhood</STRONG>
<br>
We  have a whole batch of programming  for being children, and another whole batch for being adults, and a third whole  batch for being parents. But no one has a childhood  like yours. And we owe  our childhood to our parents. Directing a stream of negative entropy upon ourselves  and on our children falls mostly to the parent batch. Passing on the genetic  line falls mostly to the adult batch. But the children are free. Children do  not direct streams of negative  entropy upon themselves -- "Mommy does it". And children don't pass on the genetic  line -- "Mommy does it". Children don't follow the prime directives. If you ask  a child what he's going to do, he says,  "I'm going to play. That's what kids  do." As Sri Ramakrishna said, "The ego of a child is nothing like the ego of  a grown-up man." You see, they both make sand castles at the beach; then the kids  run through them with their feet, but the grown-ups take pictures. 
<br><br>
<STRONG>The Beach</STRONG>
<br>
We  owe our childhood to our sojourn on the beaches of north-east Africa, where we  were probably marooned on an island a few million years ago, and where, in the  absence of the jungle, we were forced to eat at the beach. It was there, when our  body language failed in the surf, that we learned to talk. And it was there,  to accommodate the change, that we prolonged our childhood.<sup><font size=-2> (9) </font></sup>  That is why our  parenting batch is so different from that of other animals. And that is why the  curiosity and the wonder of our  childhood never comes to an end. We are the children of children who never grow  up. And there is an escape route through this genetic loophole. Don't forget  it! <CITE>Children don't follow the prime directives of the genetic programming.  </CITE>And neither did Sri Ramakrishna. Although he practiced all sorts of spiritual  practices, his native way to go was to think of himself as a child and of God as Mother.

<STRONG><H3>THE EQUATIONS OF MAYA</STRONG></H3>
We have  talked a little bit about equations  and a great deal about maya. Now we have to take a hard look  at our physics to see if any of our equations can be taken as descriptive of  maya. 
<br><br>
First of all, let me remind you that the physics of the  last century -- the physics of Swami  Vivekananda's day -- was nothing like the  physics of this century. In those days it was taken for granted that the mix of  the chemical elements in the Universe had been given at the time of creation -- if  there was a creation -- or had  been around forever -- if there was a forever -- and that if you just kept shuffling  the mix long enough, it would come out in the present configuration again. The  swami sometimes referred to that view. Don't take it as "gospel truth"; he is  just quoting the scientific view of his day. In those days it was taken for granted  that the Universe consists of real particles with real mass and real energy  moving through real space in real time. It was taken for granted that mass  and energy were different things,  that space and time were independent of each other, and that if we knew the  present position and momentum of the particles, we could predict the entire past  and future of the Universe. No one thinks like that now. There have been some  major revolutions in our understanding of physics since then, and they began just  after Swami Vivekananda passed away. 
<br><br>
<STRONG>Relativity</STRONG>
<br>
In  the winter of 1895-96, Swami Vivekananda met Nikola Tesla and asked him if he  could show that what we call  matter is just potential energy. The swami said, "I am to go and see him next week  to get this new mathematical demonstration,"<sup><font size=-2> (10) </font></sup>  which apparently never came.  It is probably unfortunate that Tesla didn't get it shown, because if relativity  theory had arisen out of a suggestion by Swami Vivekananda, the history of  modern physics might have looked very different. The notion that what we see as  matter is just potential energy was published as an appendix to Einstein's  relativity  paper ten years later,  in 1905. 
<br><br>
In 1905, Einstein changed our geometry from 3-D to 4-D. He put  time into our geometry where it belongs. Time and space come into the geometry  as a pair of opposites, so that if the space separation and the time separation  between two events, say here-now and there-then, are equal, the total separation  between those two events is zero. 
<br><br>
Euclid assumed that space separations  are objective, but Euclid's geometry is a theoretical geometry about a theoretical  space that does not, in  fact, exist. Space separations, and separations in time, are not objective. Observers  moving with respect to each other measure different distances between there  and here, and different times between then and now. What is objective is the  <CITE>total</CITE> separation, the space-time separation, between there-then  and here-now. 
<br><br>
The equation looks very much like Pythagoras' equation for  the hypotenuse of a right triangle. In Pythagoras' equation you square the two  sides of the triangle, <CITE>add</CITE>  the squares, and take the square root of that <CITE>sum.</CITE> But  in Einstein's equation, to get the space-time separation between two events, you  square the time separation and <CITE>subtract</CITE> it from the square of the  space separation, and take the square root of that <CITE>difference.</CITE><sup><font size=-2> (11) </font></sup>   So that if the space and time separations between those two events are equal,  the total separation between them is zero. And that puts the separation between  the perceiver and the perceived  at zero, because always we see events away from us in space by the trick of  seeing them back in time in just such a way that the total separation is zero.  That separation equation, as I see it, is one of the equations of maya.  If this Universe is apparitional, like a dream, then the separation between  the dreamer and the dream must be zero. 
<br><br>
It was this change in the geometry  that allowed Einstein to realize that what we see as mass (matter) is just  potential energy. E = m. That is  the equation that Swami Vivekananda hoped to get from Tesla. So now we see that  matter (mass), as well as energy, is just the underlying existence showing through  in the apparition. So that equation, too, is an equation of maya.<sup><font size=-2> (12)</font></sup> 
<br><br>
There are many things which are easier to see now than they were  in Einstein's day before the discovery of neutron stars and before the suspicion  of black holes went public. It is easy to see now that the gravitational energy  transformed to kinetic energy  in the fall of an object to the surface of a neutron star would be a tenth  of its rest mass, so that the energy released in the splash of a ten gram marshmallow  on a neutron star would be enough to vaporize a town. It is easy to see  now that, falling to the event horizon of a small black hole, one third of the  energy would be released, and that all of it would be released if the black hole  contained all the rest of the matter in the observable Universe. It is easy  to see now that as Einstein said  in 1917, "There can be no inertia relative to 'space', but only an inertia of  masses relative to one another." And it is easy to see now that that inertia is  related to their separation in the gravitational field, and not to their proximity  to each other, as Einstein seems to have thought.<sup><font size=-2> (13) </font></sup>  
<br><br>
It is easy to  see now that the Universe is wound up against gravity because the undivided shows  through in the separation. And it is easy to see now that the Universe is wound  up against the electrical  charges of the minuscule particles because the infinite shows through in the smallness.<sup><font size=-2> (14) </font></sup>   And we owe a great deal of these considerations to Einstein. But there  is another revolution that has taken place in our physics which is considered  even more basic than Einstein's change in our geometry. That is quantum mechanics. 
<br><br>
<STRONG>Quantum Mechanics</STRONG>
<br>
Matter does not behave according  to our genetic expectations. Our genetic expectations are Newtonian. They  assume Euclidian geometry, and  they assume Newtonian physics. They take for granted that space separations are  real, and that causation is transformational. That is why so many people have  so much trouble "understanding" relativity and quantum mechanics. Our genetic  expectations are offended. We cannot easily accept the fact that it is impossible  to know everything about a physical system, just as it is impossible to identify  the snake for which a rope has been mistaken. But there is this deep uncertainty  lying at the bottom of our  physics. 
<br><br>
In the late 1920's, Werner Heisenberg pointed out that the product  of our necessary uncertainty in where a particle is and our necessary uncertainty  in its momentum can never be smaller than Planck's constant over two  pi. Also that the product of our necessary uncertainty in when something happens  and our necessary uncertainty in the energy of the happening can never be less  than that same amount. This is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which I take  to be another of the equations  of maya. What it says is that if we see what we see through the  screen of time and space, we cannot quite tell what it is that we see. 
<br><br>
Richard  Feynman has said that every statement in quantum mechanics is a restatement  of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. This quantum behavior is what keeps  the electron from sitting down on the proton in a hydrogen atom, in spite of the  enormous electrical attraction between them. If we knew that much about its  position, our necessary uncertainty  in its momentum would be so large that the momentum associated with that uncertainty  would be enough to drive it off. That is why we don't fall through the  floor. If the electrons are pushed too close to the nuclei, they simply buzz  harder and keep us up. That's why the planets don't collapse. It's the uncertainty  necessitated by the fact that the first cause of our physics is apparitional. 
<br><br>
<STRONG>Summary</STRONG>
<br>
These  three equations, as I see it, are  some of the equations of maya.  Einstein's separation equation sets the separation between the perceiver  and the perceived at zero.<CITE> The dream is in the dreamer.</CITE> We  see the bright star Sirius eight and a half light years away from us by the trick  of seeing it eight and a half years ago. And the distance away comes in squared  with a plus sign but the time ago comes in squared with a minus sign, so that  if the two are equal, the total separation goes to zero. Einstein's more famous  equation, E = mc^2, "... In which  energy is set equal to mass," is the equation which Swami Vivekananda had hoped  to get from Tesla, because, as he said, "There cannot be two existences, only  one." And Heisenberg's uncertainty principle includes the notion that the observer  is always mixed up in what he sees. There is no longer any talk of a Universe  independent of the observer any more than there is talk of an apparitional  snake independent of the person who is seeing the apparition. 
<br><br>
<STRONG>Whence and Whither?</STRONG>
<br>
For  a long time I have felt that the physicists were just on the verge of noticing  that the first cause of our physics is apparitional, that our physics is the  physics of an apparitional Universe. I mentioned it to Johnny Carson when I  was on his show a couple of years ago. I said that when you mistake a rope for  a snake, what you do is to look at it very carefully, and you notice that it has  these diagonal markings on its back. And you think, "It looks like a rope. Have  we had ropes long enough for  the snakes to imitate them?" And you call it a rope-snake. Then you look carefully  at the end where the rattles should have been and you see hemp fibers. "Aha!  Rope-snake hempii." There was so much laughter that I couldn't finish. We were  cut off by the music. But what I wanted to say was that when you find that the  head end is also hemp fibers, you realize that it really is a rope. I wanted  to say that only this last step has not yet been taken by the physicists. Relativity  and quantum mechanics are  not about an actual Universe. We already have the physics of an apparition. 
<br><br>
There  are some interesting differences between the physicists and the mystics.  The mystics take existence for granted, and want to get from here to there.  They want to see beyond the apparition. And the physicists are likely to take  non-existence for granted, and want to get from there to here. The Big Bang cosmologists  want to get the Universe out of nothing. It's like asking us to believe  that nothing made everything  out of nothing. But that's not what shows in our physics. If behind what we  see there were only a zero, then where would gravity come from, and electricity,  and inertia? I have to side with the mystics. On observational grounds I have  to take existence for granted. 
<br><br>
Another interesting difference is that the  physicists are Parinamavadins. They believe that causation is transformational  and that the Universe is actual, whereas the mystics are Vivartavadins. Regardless  of what they write in their  books or what they say from the pulpit, all the mystics and religious aspirants  agree that <CITE>faith is at the root of spiritual experience. And that would not be possible unless the Universe were apparitional.</CITE>  If the milk has been made into buttermilk, faith that it's milk will be of no avail;  whereas, if you have mistaken your friend for a ghost, faith that it's your friend ends the problem. 
<br><br>
Here let me remind you that physics and philosophy  are our maps. They can be  judged as true or false according to whether they correspond or do not correspond  to fact. But mysticism (or religion) is a journey, and about a journey one  does not ask whether it is true or false, but only where it goes. Will it take me to the goal? 
<br><br>
Our problem is to reach the goal. To see beyond the screen.  You remember that Swami Vivekananda said that the Universe is the Absolute  seen through the screen of time, space, and causation. It's no use asking how  the Absolute became the Universe.  The Absolute has not become the Universe any more than the rope has become a  snake. Our problem is to see it straight. And you remember that Sri Ramakrishna  said that maya is nothing but the egotism of the embodied soul.  And that is genetic. The prime directives of the genetic programming are to direct  a stream of negative entropy upon ourselves and to pass on the genetic line.  That is why we feel ourselves to be the doers of action and the enjoyers of its  fruits. It is just a genetic  mirage. The genes have us persuaded that by following their dictates we'll reach  the peace of the changeless, the freedom of the infinite, and the bliss of the  undivided. They don't have it to give. We don't get the undivided; we get a  family. You must have noticed. 
<br><br>
Our problem is to reach the goal, and <CITE>not  be hoodwinked by the genes.</CITE> But this is not a journey from one place  to another in an actual world. <CITE>It is a journey from one point of view  to another.</CITE> That is why  it is often referred to as an "inner journey". It is a journey from an erroneous  point of view, dictated by the genes, to a point of view from which we can see  through the genetic mirage. 
<br><br>
<STRONG>Counter-cheating the Genes</STRONG>
<br>
It  is important to remember that our problem is genetic. As James Burke says,  "If you don't know how you got somewhere, you don't know where you are." And  as I say, "If you don't know where you are, how will you know where to go?" In  order to "counter-cheat" the genes,  we need to know how they have cheated us. 
<br><br>
In an apparitional Universe,  seen in time and space, there are only three drives to catch hold of -- the  drive for the changeless which we see in matter as inertia, and in ourselves as  our yearning for peace and security; the drive for the infinite which we see in  matter as electricity, and in ourselves as our yearning for freedom; and the  drive for the undivided which we see in matter as gravity, and in ourselves as  our yearning for love and bliss.  There are no other drives for the genes to catch hold of; so they have caught  hold of these three and persuade us to run after them in ways that get their genetic  necessities fulfilled, in ways that fulfill their prime directives. <CITE>But  the fulfillment of a genetic necessity does not confer on the organism the  fulfillment of the yearning that drives it.</CITE> The yearnings have been borrowed  by the genes. But the genes have left some loopholes which we built in at  the beach long ago. 
<br><br>
All  our spirituality began at that beach -- our breath control, our speech, our music  and our hymns, our worship, our mantras and our prayers. And there at the beach  we built in parenting and childhood and the ability to pass on what we know.  And now we are smart enough to counter-cheat the genes, to use the genes themselves  to help us see behind the screen. Every human emotion can be redirected from  the fulfillment of a genetic necessity to the fulfillment of our spiritual  quest. And remember, our childhood  batch is unique; children don't go along with the prime directives of the genetic  programming. "The ego of a child is nothing like the ego of a grown-up man." 
<br><br>
And  let me remind you that space is not that which separates the many,  but that which <CITE>seems</CITE> to separate the one. And in that space that  oneness shines, therefore falls whatever falls. And space is not that in which  we see the small, but that in which the infinite appears as small. And in that  space that vastness shines,  therefore bursts whatever bursts, therefore shines whatever shines. And finally,  time is not that in which we see the changing, but that in which the changeless  seems to change. And in that time that changeless shines, therefore rests whatever  rests, therefore coasts whatever coasts. 
<br><br>
Swami Vivekananda said that  science and religion would meet and shake hands. I think that time has come

</STRONG></H2><STRONG>QUESTION  #1: What are your views on cosmic  beginnings, particularly with reference to the origins of the universe, of life,  and of homo sapiens?
<br><br>
<a href="#BigPoof"><img src="../graphics/buttons/downArrow.gif" align="right" border=0></a><br>
<H3>THE  ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE</STRONG></H3>For one who feels that the Big  Bang cosmology is not well supported by the observational evidence, and for one  who suspects that the Universe  may not have had a beginning at all, any discussion of "cosmic beginnings" with  respect to the "origin" of the Universe must take on a rather odd look. If  the Universe could be "actual", i.e. if it could have arisen through some process  of physics, then its beginning could be considered to be a "happening in time"  and a discussion of "origins" would be in order. But if, as I have suggested,  the Universe might be apparitional, rather than actual, then the discussion of  origins must take the form of  an investigation into the nature of the apparition. <CITE>We must know what might  be behind the apparition, what are the consequences of such an apparition,  and whether they correspond to what we see.</CITE> Also, we should see whether  or not the notion that the Universe is apparitional might help to explain some of the things which heretofore we have had to take for granted.
<br><br>
For instance,  Newton's laws of motion take inertia for granted. Special relativity takes  space and time for granted. General  relativity takes gravity for granted. Quantum electrodynamics takes electricity  for granted as well as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Pauli's Verbot  (Pauli's exclusion principle). But must we take all this for granted? Or  can we, with the Advaita Vedantins, put an apparitional first cause under our physics?
<br><br>
Although  in the Big Bang models everything we see must be traced  back to the original fireball, in a Steady State model everything must be traced  back to the primordial hydrogen,  made of electricity and inertia, and falling together by gravity to galaxies  and stars. And the question is: can we understand that this primordial hydrogen  with its gravity, electricity, and inertia could arise apparitionally from  what underlies the apparition? And can we, in the light of this apparitional model,  understand why the electron doesn't sit down on the proton in a hydrogen atom  (in spite of the enormous electrical attraction between them), and why the  spin-one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac  statistics? (i.e. why they obey Pauli's Verbot?)
<br><br>
To ask what might  exist behind such an apparition is to ask what might exist in the absence  of matter, energy, space and time, and it is easy to get an answer to that question  in terms of negation. In the absence of time we are left with the changeless,  since change can take place only in time. And since smallness and dividedness  can exist only in space, in the absence of space we are left with the infinite,  the undivided.
<br><br>
So what  I am suggesting is that by seeing what we see as if in space and time, we might  have mistaken the changeless, the infinite, the undivided for something else.  And the question is whether that something else could be expected to take the  form of the Universe as we see it. I am suggesting that the nature of the apparition  is seeing what we see as if in space and time, and that what's behind the  apparition is the changeless, the infinite, the undivided. <CITE>So our remaining  question is: what would be  the consequences of such an apparition, and do these consequences correspond  to what we see?
<br>
</CITE><br>Now this apparitional causation, as  I call it, was analyzed a long time ago in India by the Advaita Vedantins and the  Buddhists, and they came to some very interesting conclusions. They pointed  out that in order to mistake a rope for a snake you must fail to see the rope rightly  (as in the twilight). This they called the veiling power of<CITE> tamas.</CITE>  Then you must jump to the  wrong conclusion (that it's a snake). This they called the projecting power  of <CITE>rajas</CITE>. But also they pointed out that you must have seen the rope  to start with (in the partial light of twilight) or the mistake might have taken  some more arbitrary form. This they called the revealing power of <CITE>sattva.</CITE>  The length and diameter of the rope are simply misinterpreted as the  length and diameter of a snake.
<br><br>
This apparitional causation was referred  to by the Vedantins as <CITE>vivarta</CITE>,  and it was contrasted with <CITE>parinama</CITE>, transformational  causation, (as when milk is transformed into buttermilk, or as when gravitational  energy is transformed into kinetic energy in the downward swing of a pendulum).  What we ordinarily think of nowadays as causation is what the Vedantins  called <CITE>parinama</CITE>. It involves the transformation of energy from  one form to another without any change in the amount. And it is governed by the  conservation laws. The energy  that goes into a process at the beginning comes out at the end. The form may change  but not the amount. Now, since the Universe is made out of energy, it cannot  have arisen by transformation, except from energy. It cannot arise from nothing.  <CITE>You can get a Universe out of a Universe by transformational causation,  but you  can't get it out of nothing. However, it can arise from the underlying  existence by apparition.</CITE>
<br><br>
So if the "origin" of  the Universe is apparitional,  and if the nature of the apparition is seeing what we see as if in space and time,  and if what's behind the apparition is the changeless, the infinite, the undivided,  then the consequences of such an apparition would be that we would see  the changeless as if changing, the infinite as if finite, and the undivided as  if divided. But, because of the revealing power, we must have seen the changeless  in the changing, and that is what I see as inertia; we must have seen the infinite  in the finite, and that  is what I see as the electrical charge of the minuscule particles; and we must  have seen the undivided in the divided, and that is what I see as gravity. And  thus far these consequences <CITE>do</CITE> correspond to what we see. And they  also provide a possible explanation for gravity, electricity and inertia, which  heretofore we have had to take for granted.
<br><br>
As I see it, the only reason  the Universe is energetically wound up is because it is apparitional. (In an  apparition the underlying existence  <CITE>must </CITE>show through.) Otherwise the dispersed particles could  stay dispersed. What would be the need for gravity if the undivided didn't have  to show through in the apparition? And the minuscule particles could remain uncharged.  What would be the need for the electrical charge if the infinite didn't  have to show through in the apparition? And why should matter show inertia?  Why should it fight every change in its state of motion except for the fact that  the changeless has to show in  the changes of the apparition? As I see it, gravity, electricity, and inertia  are simply the nature of the underlying existence showing through in the apparition  through what the Vedantins call the revealing power.
<br><br>
We see (as a pair  of opposites) a gravitational "plurality" against an electrical "duality".  That is, the gravitational rest energy of the proton is related to its separation  in the gravitational field from all the rest of the matter in the observable  Universe, whereas its electrical  rest energy is related only to its smallness in the electrical field and to  its separation from a single electron. But if the Universe is apparitional, something  must prevent the demise of the electrical duality in the presence of the  gravitational plurality. As I see it, that is why matter obeys Heisenberg's uncertainty  principle. And likewise, something must prevent the demise of the gravitational  plurality in the presence of the duality. And that, as I see it, is  why spin-one-half particles obey  Fermi-Dirac statistics, or Pauli's Verbot. (The demise of the electrical duality  is not prevented for an electron and a positron or for a proton and an anti-proton.  But in the presence of the gravitational <CITE>dissimilarity</CITE> of  the electron and the proton in the primordial hydrogen, it is prevented by Heisenberg's  uncertainty principle.) Similarly, two spin-one-half particles (i.e.  protons, electrons, and neutrons) in the presence of that spin-duality cannot occupy  the same energy state. (That  is, they obey Fermi-Dirac statistics, i.e. Pauli's Verbot.) That's what prevents  the gravitational collapse of a neutron star.
<br><br>
As I see it, the reason  we had to take space and time, gravity, electricity and inertia, as well as  Heisenberg's uncertainly principle and Pauli's exclusion principle for granted  is simply because they all arise by apparition and not by any transformation.  So in the absence of an understanding of the "first cause" we had no model on the  basis of which we could understand  them.
<br><br>
If there is anything to this suggestion, i.e. that the Universe  might have arisen by apparition--that the first cause might be apparitional  (and it's certainly counter- intuitive), then it would seem to me that in order  to avoid representing any change in the changeless it must have arisen as pairs  of opposites so that the total linear momentum, the total angular momentum  and the total electrical charge of the observable Universe should be zero. If it  could be shown that there is  an overall residual momentum or electrical charge, I should deem this suggestion  to have failed. And if, as this suggestion seems to imply, hydrogen is the primordial  apparition, then it would seem that neither the proton nor the electron  should decay. If they arise by apparition, how could they decay by transformation  within that apparition? If it can be shown that the proton does indeed decay,  then I should suspect that this suggestion may have failed.
<br><br>
<CITE>It  will be of no use to suggest that  this is metaphysics and need not be taken seriously. Anything which influences  the existence or behavior of what we see as matter is within the domain of  physics.</CITE>

<STRONG><H3>STEADY STATE vs.  BIG BANG</H3></STRONG>
Since this apparitional cosmology rather  favors a Steady State model over the Big Bang Models, perhaps I should say  something about what drives the cosmic expansion. Perhaps, also, I should discuss  the source of the microwave  background radiation and the "new hydrogen" needed to keep up the cosmic density.  Then, too, I should say something about the helium abundance and about what  has come to be called the "dark matter".
<br><br>
<STRONG>Cosmic Expansion</STRONG>
<br>
Observationally,  what we see is that all the distant galaxies seem to be  running away from us. And the simplest and most straightforward explanation is  that long ago there was this Big Bang explosion and that that is what drives the  cosmic expansion. (In the Big  Bang models, this explosion stands without explanation.) In this Steady State  model, on the other hand, the energy which drives the cosmic expansion is simply  the energy of the radiation which is lost in the expansion. As the galaxies and  stars condense, their gravitational energy is transformed to radiation and radiated  away into the expanding spaces of the Universe. If the energy of the radiation  is lost in the expansion, then it <CITE>must</CITE> drive the expansion.  
<br><br>
<STRONG>Background Radiation</STRONG>
<br>
In  this Steady State model it is the conditions at the border  of the observable Universe imposed by the expansion that are the source of both  the background radiation and the "new hydrogen". As seen by us, the radiation  from matter seen to be approaching the border is red-shifted approaching zero  energy. But if the radiation energy approaches zero, so does the particle energy  and the particle mass. Then, since radiation going through a field of low-mass  particles would be thermalized  to 3K, it would appear to us as the background radiation. The amount of 3K  radiation predicted by this model matches what we measure. The amount predicted  by the Big Bang model is at least one order of magnitude too high. 
<br><br>
<STRONG>"New  Hydrogen"</STRONG>
<br>
Also, near the border, where the mass approaches  zero, the momentum of the particles must also approach zero, and with it, our  uncertainty in that momentum. (You can't have a big uncertainty about a very small  momentum.) Then, by Heisenberg's  uncertainty principle, if our uncertainty in the momentum approaches zero,  our uncertainty in where the particles are must approach infinity. The hydrogen  simply "tunnels" back in.
<br><br><br>
<STRONG>Helium Abundance</STRONG>
<br>
For  the Big Bang models, the observed helium abundance is far too low unless most  of the matter of the Universe involved in the fireball explosion was of such  a nature that it could not be made into helium. It has therefore been suggested  by some proponents of the Big  Bang model that some 90% to 99% of the matter in the Universe is of such a nature  that it responds only to gravity, and not to any of the other forces such as  electricity and magnetism which might allow us to detect it. This "dark matter",  as it is called, is thought to surround the visible galaxies, but not to reside  within them. And the problem is, that if it responds only to gravity, why doesn't  it all fall in?
<br><br>
<STRONG>Dark Matter</STRONG>
<br>
For a Steady State  model, there is no problem about  the dark matter being ordinary matter, because the visible galaxies could be  expected to be surrounded by what I call "hovering layers" of ordinary matter  blown out by the stellar winds. When a cluster of stars condenses from a cloud  of gas, some 90% to 99% of the material in the cloud could be expected to be blown  away by the stellar winds of the cluster. Since the diameters of these hovering  layers may be five to ten times the diameters of the associated galaxies,  their densities might be well  below one percent of the densities of the associated galaxies. The detection of  this material might be rendered problematical simply by its low density.<STRONG>

<H3>THE  ORIGIN  OF LIFE</STRONG></H3>
For a Big Bang cosmology, in which the early Universe was  extremely hot, a discussion of the origin of life is of course appropriate, since  life could not have been with us from the beginning. But for a Steady State  model, in which the Universe is  without beginning, perhaps life itself could be without beginning. However, the  question then arises: how could it spread from solar system to solar system  or from galaxy to galaxy? Somehow it seems that life must have had a start, that  somehow life must arise spontaneously from non-living matter. Yet thus far there  is no evidence for this.
<br><br>
Pasteur thought that he had shown that life  does not arise from non-living matter but only from previous life. Darwin seems  to have taken the other view,  namely, that it might have arisen from "some warm pool". The evidence, of course,  is simply that life does exist on this planet, which presumably had a beginning;  so if life didn't come from elsewhere, it must have arisen here. But how?  <CITE>What could pull non-living matter across the border into life? 
<br><br>
</CITE>
Natural  selection as Darwin sketched it is a very good mechanism for selecting  between two or more genetic programmings, but it makes no suggestion as to  the origin of the programs. And  as yet this is an unsolved problem. But how about the origin of sentiency and  intelligence? Could they have arisen from inert matter?
<br><br><br>
<STRONG>Sentiency</STRONG>
<br>
For  any cosmological model in which the Universe is considered  to be "actual", the problem of the origin of sentiency and intelligence is  insoluble. But if the Universe is apparitional, sentiency is in it from the word  "go". Even the atoms are "sentient". We have senses for the perception of gravity,  kinetic energy, radiation,  electricity and magnetism, because the individual protoplasmic cells can respond  to these same five kinds of energy. And the cells can respond to them because  the atoms respond to them. The atoms themselves respond to gravity, kinetic  energy, radiation, electricity and magnetism. The plumb bob "knows" where the Earth  is, and the electron "knows" where the proton is. Sentiency is in this from  the word "go", because the underlying existence is "involved" in what we see  and must show through.
<br><br>
It  is hopeless to expect that something like sentiency or intelligence, or anything,  for that matter, could arise by "evolution" (as a rose evolves from a bud),  unless it was first put in by "involution". The reason the oak tree can "evolve"  from the acorn is because it was first put in the acorn through "involution"  by the parent trees. But in the case of the tree and the acorn, the involution  is by transformational causation,<CITE> parinama.</CITE> Whereas, in the case  of the underlying existence and  the Universe, the involution is by apparitional causation, or<CITE> vivarta</CITE>.  What underlies the Universe is involved by apparition in us and what we  see. And since what underlies all this is infinite, there is no knowing what may  evolve. <sup><font size=-1>(1)</font></sup>
<br><br>
<CITE>The expectation that sentiency and  intelligence might arise from "inert matter" is contrary to all the experience  of our race. </CITE>But matter is not inert. It is "ert", (it moves by itself)  because what underlies the apparition shows through. <CITE>And the notion that  what is more might evolve from what is less is beyond the domain of reason.</CITE>
<br>

<tt>1:    c.f. Teilhard de Chardin: "In the world, nothing could ever  burst forth as final across the different thresholds successively traversed by  evolution (however critical they be) which has not already existed in an obscure  and primordial way..." (<CITE>Phenomenon  of Man. </CITE>New York:  Harper and Row,1955. Book One, Chapter Three,  Section I B.)</tt>
<br>
<br><STRONG>Intelligence</STRONG>
<br>
So  sentiency arises by apparition and is with us from  the word "go". But how about intelligence? Intelligence, as we know it, is associated  with the egos of poly-celled organisms, like ourselves, who have brains.  And brains come down through a long transformational past. Even our individual  brains have a transformational past from a single cell, to where we are now.  Each of our bodies is made up of a very great number of cells, and we have no awareness  of the egos of the individual  cells. Yet each of us, at the time of conception, was a one-celled organism  without a brain. However, that single cell had a complete human form transformationally  involved in its gene code through the grace of our parents.
<br><br>
So,  although sentiency might arise apparitionally, it looks as though intelligence  arises transformationally. It looks as though intelligence arises from sentiency  as a genetic invention of the ego. It looks as though intelligence, like  egotism, is a genetic invention  which favors survival. And it looks as though what we proudly think of as our  advanced state of intelligence was forced upon us by the use of tools and language.
<br><br>
So  the underlying existence shows through in what we see. What difference  does it make whether you think of it as The Formless, or call it Mother,  or Father? The question that remains is this: <CITE>does the pull of the underlying  existence (the changeless, the undivided, the infinite) pull matter across  the border from the non-living  to the living? Does it pull sentiency to intelligence? And does it  pull the  saints to final beatitude?</CITE>
<br><br>
Through the discrimination between plus  and minus in the electrical duality, that oneness holds the electrons near  the protons in the hydrogen. Through the discrimination between up and down in  the gravitational plurality, that oneness falls the hydrogen together into clouds.  And through the discrimination between spin-up and spin-down, it pulls the  particles together in pairs to  make molecules and the entire atomic table.
<br><br>
<CITE>Does that  oneness, through molecular discrimination, pull what we see as matter into life?  Does it, through the discriminations of the ego, pull sentiency to intelligence?  And does it, through the discrimination between the real and the make-believe,  pull the emotions of the saints to the goal?</CITE>
<br><br>
We  are like Xerox machines looking for Xerox machines to copy. And because  the underlying existence  shows through in us, we are pulled toward peace and love and freedom, and we look  for them in others. If we see a special manifestation of peace and serenity,  or of love and happiness, or of strength and freedom, or of compassion, our hearts  open and we are drawn to it. All animals, when they mate, pick out species  characteristics, and so do we. It is probably our tendency to breed in this direction  that has separated us so far from other animals. And in this tendency,  I see the hope for our future.

<STRONG><H3>THE  ORIGIN OF HOMO SAPIENS</STRONG></H3>
About the origin of <CITE>Homo sapiens,</CITE>  it should be said that although formerly it was considered a great mystery,  and there was a great deal of talk about the missing link, (that is, what happened between the chimps and ourselves), by now this mystery has been largely cleared up. And what happened between the chimps and us has been fairly well investigated  by Sir Alister Hardy, Desmond  Morris, Elaine Morgan, Leon P. La Lumiere, Jr., and others. <sup><font size=-1>(2)</font></sup>  It now  seems more than likely that a few of our chimp-like ancestors, dwelling in a mountainous  area of northeast Africa some ten or fifteen million years ago, were  cut off from the mainland by a rise in sea level which reduced our homeland to  an island. Gradually, as our local jungles dwindled, we were forced more and more  to forage at the beach. And  what I should like to say here is that it is what happened at that beach that  led up to this Parliament of Religions. It is what happened at that beach that  separated us from the chimpanzees and led to our propensity for science and religion.
<br><br>
Often  in my youth it was suggested by the anthropologists that first  we somehow (miraculously?) developed this big brain and then invented language  and the use of tools. But no one thinks like that now. Nowadays it is more  or less taken for granted that  we were forced by our situation to the use of tools and language and that that  is what imposed on us the need for a bigger brain.
<br>

<br><br>
<STRONG>Tools</STRONG>
<br>
Anyone  who has foraged at the beach knows that the easily  available protein supply comes mostly packaged in calcium carbonate shells which  require to be broken open with a stone. Any chimp could see that. Louis Leaky  found that the early stone tools of our ancestors in Olduvai Gorge were made  of "stream-rounded boulders". Why?  Because we came from the beach, where all the stones were rounded and where  we used them for procuring food. 
<br><br>
<STRONG>Language</STRONG>
<br>
And surely  it was there at that beach, where our body language failed in the surf, that  we were forced to use speech. Elaine Morgan, in <CITE>The</CITE> <CITE>Aquatic  Ape</CITE>, rightly points out that speech cannot arise until breath control arises,  and breath control arises in the water. We already had our body-language,  which, as Desmond Morris points  out in <CITE>The Naked Ape,</CITE> is easily understood by the chimps, the gorillas,  the orangs and ourselves. But what good is dancing in the sea? We needed  another means of communication more suitable in the water. All the other animals  on this planet who talk (namely the dolphins and the whales), do it in the  sea. 
<br><br>
<STRONG>Aquatic Adaptations</STRONG>
<br>
Although the temperature  of the water at our beach was nearly 90° F, the shift from the jungle to the beach  must have imposed on us a severe  pressure to change. We needed feet instead of hands on our lower extremities  for paddling sand and water. We needed a cushion on our buttocks for sitting  on the sand. We needed fat under the skin for buoyancy and streamlining in the  water, and we didn't need our fur. We grew hair on our heads for the sake of  children in the water, and learned to fight with our fists to protect them from  the sharks. It is fortunate for us that the dolphins beat us back to the sea and  reprogrammed the sharks against  blunt punches. No land animal will yield to your fists.
<br><br>
<STRONG>Neoteny</STRONG>
<br>
Now  one of the genetic mechanisms which we used in our forced adjustment  to the beach is what is called <CITE>neoteny</CITE>, the retaining into  later life of juvenile characteristics. We delayed the invasion of our childhood  by our more adult point of view. House cats, like most animals, reach the  adult stage in about a year, and the insatiable curiosity of the kitten dies away.  But not for us. Our brain continues  to grow, and our insatiable curiosity lingers on. Out of that lingering  curiosity arose science and religion. It is our lingering curiosity that led  up to this Parliament.
<br><a name="ScienceReligion"></a><br>
<STRONG>Science and Religion</STRONG>
<br>
We are the  children of children who never grow up. And it is the lingering wonder of childhood  which gave rise to Newton's<CITE> Principia,</CITE> to relativity, to quantum  mechanics, and to all the religions of the world. It was there at that beach  that we learned the breath  control of the yogis. It was there at that beach that we learned to talk and to  sing. Our hymns and our prayers and our yearning to know arose at that beach  and follow us still. And the beauty and freedom of childhood follow us still. But  in order that our childhood could be free, the responsibility for our upkeep  has been thrown on our parents. The prolonging of our youth has imposed on us  the prolonging of our parenting. Our youth and our parenting are not like those  of other animals. Like them, we  have genetic programming to see us through our adult phase and to persuade us  to pass on the genetic line. But unlike them we have genetic programming to see  us through a prolonged childhood and a prolonged period of parenting which is  required to support it. Children don't fulfill the prime directives of the genetic  programming, namely, to keep ourselves alive and well, and to pass on the  genetic code. Our parents do it for us. Out of this beauty and freedom of our childhood,  monasticism arose. "...Turned  from home and toil and kindred, leaving all for His dear sake." The monks  and nuns neither earn their keep, nor pass on the genetic line, but continue  instead in the wonder of childhood: <CITE>"What or Who is beyond what I see?"</CITE>
<br><br><br>
<STRONG>QUESTION  #3: What do you think should be the relationship  between religion and science?
<br><br>
</STRONG>I feel that  religion and science should meet and shake hands. <CITE>But it won't happen until  the first cause is put under  our physics.</CITE> If some important (well known) physicist, say John Archibald  Wheeler or Stephen Hawking, were to notice that relativity and quantum mechanics  are evidence that the Universe is apparitional rather than actual, then  the news would spread world wide in a week. I used to hope that Richard Feynman  would notice it, but he is gone.
<br><br>
The mystics already see that the world  is apparitional. Regardless of what they say from the pulpit or what they write  in their books, they all see  the Universe as apparitional because they all agree that faith is at the root of  spiritual practice. And if the world were actual, faith would have no part in  it. When milk has been made into buttermilk, faith that it's milk will get you  nowhere. But if you have mistaken a rope for a snake, faith that it's a rope ends  the problem.
<br><br>
Fritjof Capra wrote a very interesting book called the  <CITE>Tao of Physics</CITE> in which he points out similarities in the language  of the mystics and the physicists.  Now as I see it, the reason for these similarities is that they are both describing  an apparitional world. In an actual transformation, like milk into buttermilk,  there is no confusion of language. First there is milk, then there is  a process, and finally there is buttermilk. But if one has mistaken a rope for  a snake and I ask, "Is there a snake?", and you answer, "Yes", then I say, "Show  me!" If you answer, "No", I say, "Kick it!" This sort of confusion runs all  through the writings of the mystics  and the scientists simply because the world is apparitional. If the mystics  and the scientists could agree that the first cause behind what we see is apparitional,  we could all sit down together and have a talk--we could meet and shake  hands.
<br><br>
The mystics take existence for granted and want to get from "here  to there", (to see behind the apparition), and that is possible. But for the  most part the scientists take non-existence for granted and want to get from  "there to here", and that is not  possible. Nothing does not become something. And even if you accept Swami Vivekananda's  point of view that the Universe is the Absolute seen through the screen  of time, space and causation, still you cannot ask how that became this. The  Absolute does not become the Universe. It is only an appearance, a misinterpretation.  "When will they ever learn?"
<br><br>
The question is not, "How did that  become this?", but, "Why do I continue to see it this way?" And that comes down  through a long line of ancestry  as a genetic predilection. The undividedness which shows in matter as gravity  shows in us as love, but the genes have us chase it in ways that give rise to  offspring. This doesn't require an explanation. The infinite which shows in matter  as electrical charge shows in us as our yearning for freedom, but the genes  have us chase it by eating and breathing and keeping the body strong and well.  And the changeless which shows in matter as inertia shows in us as our yearning  for peace and security for  the body. These are prime directives of our genetic programming which have come  down to us from a distant past through a long line of ancestors who followed the  dictates of the genes. But because of our long sojourn at the beach in Africa  a few million years ago, our children don't follow the prime directives of the  genetic programming. They neither procure their own food nor pass on the genetic  code, and neither do monks and nuns.
<br><br>
Science is a map to tell us where  we are and how we got there.  Religion is a journey. But there needn't be a conflict between the cartographer  and the pilgrim.
<br><br><br>
<STRONG>
QUESTION  #2: What are your views on human ends, especially as this relates to the framework  of cosmic beginnings?
<br><br>
</STRONG>The aim of science  is to make a better map, and what is needed is a better understanding of the first  cause. The aim of religion is to help the pilgrims on their way, to help them  see beyond the screen, and  what is needed is a better map by which to chart the journey. Both science and  religion are investigations into the nature of the world and our place in it. How  did we get here, and where do we go? What is also needed it the simple recognition  that we are all pilgrims on whatever paths, headed for the same goal. Our  problem now is to get beyond the thralldom of the genes, to discriminate between  the underlying existence and the apparition, between the real and the make-believe,  and to let the make believe  go. Individually, we can do it even now. Can we do it as a race? Will our  genetic programming ever reach a point where this is easier?

<br>


Out  through the Furnace Creek Wash we're leaving Death Valley through  falling snow. Four years ago we brought the 24 incher ["Delphinium"] into Death  Valley, for the first time, through a blizzard in the Tehachapis. We barely got  through, leaving 7,000 motorists stranded in the passes. We had the advantage  of weight. The telescope weighs  nearly 600 pounds. On that first trip it endured five nights of rain and wind.  That was its first year and its first long trip. By now it's been through several  blizzards and some fifteen nights in the rain. Delphinium was mean for fairer  skies but she spends most of her useful life in the mountains and has to take  what she gets. By now she has hauled nearly twenty thousand miles and served  many thousands of people in the mountains and the deserts, as far south as San  Diego, as far east as Arizona.
<p>
We  arrived in Death Valley three nights before Christmas and left on New  Year's morning. That gave us nine days and nine nights to entertain the public  with our telescopes on the sidewalks and lawns of the Visitor Center at Furnace  Creek. Thousands of people came to look. Early in the evenings they saw Venus  and Jupiter and sometimes the moon.
<p>
When the turbulence was low the larger  telescopes were often on Saturn or the moon or occasionally on Mars, and on  one night on Sirius B, the white  dwarf companion of the Dog Star, with a density of thirty tons per pint. It  has been pulled together in its own gravitational field till there is no longer  any room for the electrons to choose energy states around the atomic nuclei.  They must now choose energy states through the star as a whole and further collapse  is forbidden by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Any further decrease in  the uncertainly of an electron's position by the further collapse of the star  must be made at the expense of  increasing the uncertainly of its momentum. This it the terminal ailment of small  stars like our sun, making it possible for them finally to cool off without  further gravitational collapse.
<p>
When the darkness and transparency of the  sky were good the larger telescopes were often on the Great Nebula in Orion  or on the Crab or on NGC 2024 or occasionally on the Horsehead. Early in the evening  they were sometimes on the Dumbbell or the Ring or on the globular cluster  M-15 [in Pegasus]. Later in the  night they were more likely to be on M-81 or 82 or even on M-31.
<p>
Hundreds  of people saw the dark lanes of the spiral arms of M-31 through The Little  One [17 incher]. Even in the proximity of the five-day moon it was easy to see.  Through the the 24 incher the spiral arms of M-81 were easy. M-81 is nearly four  times as far away as M-31, which can easily be seen with the bare eyes from  Death Valley. It [M-31] is only two million light years away and is the most distant  collection of suns still  visible with the bare eyes. The number of suns in M-31 is equal to the number  of grains of sixty grit carborundum in twenty tons. It is the largest member of  our local group of galaxies.
<p>
We showed the people M-15 so that they could  compare an old, densely populated globular star cluster with the young, sparsely  populated clusters in the spiral arms, such as the Double Cluster, or the  Pleiades, or the Great Nebula in Orion where the stars are even now forming from  the beautiful, bright cloud of  gas which contrasts so strikingly with the associated dust clouds. It is in our  own wrap of spiral arm and from our own neighborhood it is undoubtedly the brightest,  most beautiful and most colorful sight beyond our solar system. Through  either of the larger telescopes it is a spectacular sight. Through either telescope  it runs far out of the eyepiece field, more so through the 24. We pull  the telescopes too far out to the west and let the cloud drift through the eyepiece  field while the people watch.  On a good night one can see a great deal of detail in the bright, blue-green  nebulosity around the six stars in the Trapezium and the bright nebulosity is  studded with faint stars. From the time the Great Nebula was reasonably high above  the south eastern horizon until most of the visitors had left, one or another  of the larger telescopes could usually be pointed to it.
<p>
This was the  most publicized tour we ever took and one of the most successful from the standpoint  of the number of viewers  and the number of objects viewed, even from the standpoint of the number and  size of the telescopes. So many people saw things through so many large telescopes  that it elicited a great deal of comment. Many wanted to know where to find  us again and several people said that looking through the telescopes had been  the highlight of their trip.
<p>
The Sidewalk Astronomers are Astronomical Entertainers  to Her Majesty the People-at-Large. What we need is millions of Sidewalk Astronomers scattered all  over the world. If we had several dozen hard-core Astronomical Entertainers in  every large city we might be able to get done what we're trying to do. At least  half the population of the world should have the opportunity to see the rest  of the Universe through large telescopes from beyond the jurisdiction of the city  lights and smog. Those who have telescopes  should be encouraged to entertain...  There is a special beauty in the astronomical knowledge picked up by those who manage telescopes on behalf  of the people-at-large. Everyone should see. Everyone should understand. What we do for ourselves is a waste. What we do for others is beauty. Those who help  others to see will see.  Those who help others to understand, they indeed will  understand.
<p>
Only occasionally are we able to show so many people  so many dim objects in skies so satisfactorily dark. The rangers were most cooperative  and turned off the flood lights which normally play on the front wall  of the Death Valley Museum. Only  that cooperation made it possible for us successfully to show the visitors  the spiral arms of galaxies, and such dim objects as the Horsehead Nebula, the  nearby brighter  nebula of dust and gas--NGC 2024, and also the Crab. Once again  we saw the stars in the Crab Nebula through the 24 incher. They are difficult  to see but worth the effort since one of the two stars near the center is the  pulsar responsible for the gaseous envelope around it which we now call the Crab.
<p>
Only  nine hundred and  twenty years ago there was no such thing as the Crab Nebula visible in our skies.  Only nine hundred and twenty years ago, as seen from our solar system, that  star was invisible to us, but by then the center of that star consisted of one  huge iron ball from which no further speck of nuclear energy could be extracted  to further the delay of its gravitational collapse. It is a rather curious thing  that the most powerful explosive in the universe appears to be a large iron  ball from which the last speck  of nuclear energy has already been extracted. We have chemical explosives like TNT, electrical explosives in the form of these huge balls of iron which, in the  long course of stellar evolution, form in the centers of stars more massive  than our sun. Over the long course of stellar evolution the energy released by  nuclear fusions in these massive stars simply delays their inevitable gravitational  collapse till it can delay no longer. When the last speck of nuclear energy  has been called up and spent  and the center of such a star has thus been reduced to iron it is absolutely powerless  against its own gravitational field. It has now become a gravitational  explosive. There is no way to prevent its collapse to a neutron star, and when  it goes the gravitational energy released to other forms when the iron falls to  neutrons lights up the interstellar night with the light of a hundred million  suns.
<p>
From the dust of such exploding stars all our us are born. Most of  the materials of which our bodies  are made, including the iron, were scattered through the galaxy from the outer  regions of these collapsing stars by these brilliant, gravitational explosions during the 5 or 10 billion years before our sun was born.
<p>
The spinning  iron ball whose gravitational collapse powered the explosion which produced  the Crab Nebula spins now as a neutron star at the center of the cloud, visible  only on a good night and with a fairly large telescope at a distance of some six  thousand light years. Thirty  times a second it spins and thirty times a second it sends us a flash of light.  Thirty times a second it spins but its gravitational field is so strong that  it does not fly apart. Its gravitational field is so strong that a spoonful of  ice cream splashing on its surface would release enough energy to vaporize a town.  It has been pulled together in its own gravitational field that there is no  longer any room for the electrons to choose energy states through the star as  a whole. Now the electrons sit  right on the protons. The certainty in the position of the electron is now bought  at the expense of the increased uncertainly in its momentum.
<p>
The energy  of the electron, and with it the uncertainly in its momentum, is pumped up,  in that final collapse, by the gravitational field which pulls the star together  to almost unbelievable densities and leaves it spinning so hard that for several  thousand years the energy of its spin lights up the interstellar night. This  is the terminal ailment of stars  a little larger than our sun.
<p>
We are grateful to all those who make  this trip possible, and to those who contributed to its success. We are grateful  to those who made the telescopes, and to those who hauled them, to those who  operated them and to those who contributed to the Transportation Fund. We are also  grateful to the rangers whose cooperation made it possible for us to show so many things to so many people, and we are grateful to the gardener for allowing  us to set the telescopes on  the lawn.
<p>
Although on this trip we were able to entertain several thousand people with many fine views, billions of eyes are waiting.

<p>
<STRONG>But  what is light?<BR></STRONG><BR> From ancient times these questions have come down to us. How many minds have wondered about the nature of space and light? How many songs? How many hymns? In the 1700's Euler, the great mathematician, wrote to a German princess, "This is, beyond question, one of the most important inquiries in physics." 
<p>
 In the 1600's, with the help of a prism, Newton had separated sunlight into its constituent colors which he thought of as its "least parts". He thought of light as corpuscular.  "Are not the rays of light very small bodies emitted from shining substances?" He thought that the colors were made by corpuscles of different sizes. The corpuscles were thought to travel as the planets travel, according to Newton's laws of motion. Left alone they traveled in straight lines. 
<p>
<STRONG>For many years Newton's view swept the field. But why don't corpuscles collide?<BR></STRONG> <BR> Gradually at the hands  of Huygens, Young, and Frensnel, Euler's notion that light might be a vibration like sound began to gain ground.  But if light, like sound, was a wave motion, it required a medium for its transmission. Space could no longer be empty. Space must be filled with a material substance which came to be called the luminiferous ether. 
<p>
But how could the ether be sufficiently rigid to transmit the vibrations at the speed of light and yet let the planets pass through it? 
<p>
Then came Faraday with the  discovery of electromagnetic induction. There were lines of force through space.  There were electric and magnetic  fields. Space was filled with fields, and the fields were filled with energy.  There were gravitational fields and electromagnetic fields. And Maxwell suggested  that light was an electromagnetic wave through space, through the luminiferous ether.  
<p>
Then came Michelson and Morley. But no one could find the ether. Then came Planck and Einstein. Light, whether a wave or a particle, was quantized. And the energy of the quanta was Planck's constant times the frequency (E=hv). As Newton had suggested long ago, the color is related to the size (in this case energy) of the quanta. G.N. Lewis, who used the term "jiffy" for the length of time it takes light to cross a centimeter, called the quanta "photons".  But the speed of the photons, with respect to the observer, is independent of the observer's motion through space. So Einstein thought that we could keep the photons, but who needs the ether? The photons, like fish out of water, were without the sea of the luminiferous ether in which to swim. But wait! Einstein put time into our geometry with space (where it belongs) so what does that do to our space? What we say now is that, "Matter tells space-time how to bend and space-time tells matter how to move" [Ref: Wheeler].  And, as Swami Vivekananda [a Vedantist monk and lecturer who visited the U.S. twice around the turn of the century] suggested to Tesla in the winter of 1895-96, that what we see as matter is just potential energy (E=m). Matter is wound up against space-time and space-time is wound up against [matter]. 
<p>
<STRONG>But what happens to our light?<BR></STRONG> <BR> In the four dimensional geometry of space-time we see things at a distance by seeing them in the past. The separation between the emission events and the absorption events of the photons goes to zero, and even the fish are gone. We are left with a universe which looks more like a dream. The separation between the perceiver and the perceived goes to zero because space and time come into Einstein's equation as a pair of opposites. (<img src="graphics/SpaceTimeEqu.gif" border=0 alt="S=sqrt(x^2 - t^2)" width=93 height=12>, where x and t are the space-time separations between the two events, and S is the total space-time separation between those two events.) What we see as a light-year away, we see as a year ago, because the time comes in squared with a minus sign. 
<p>
<STRONG> But what are the fields and what are the forces? What is the gravitational attraction, what is electricity, and what is inertia? And, what could exist in the absence of space and time?  <BR></STRONG><BR> Whatever exists in the absence of time must be the changeless, since change takes place only in time. And whatever exists in the absence of space must be infinite and undivided, since smallness and dividedness can only exist in space. But how does it show in space and time? Is gravity the undivided? And is love? Is electricity the infinite? And is our yearning for freedom? And is inertia the changeless, and is our yearning for peace? Are gravity, electricity, and inertia simply the underlying existence as we see it in space and time? Light has been reduced to the emission and absorption events and the photons are gone. Space and time have been reduced to a pair of opposites with zero separation between the perceiver and the perceived. So, the dream is in the dreamer, but the dream is alive, because the underlying existence shows through us in what we see.

Science is searching for its soul; spirituality is seeking its intellect.  In ages past, each has delivered a lonely monolog.  At times, these two voices have been discordant.  Now both pursue what the other already offers.  This is the play unfolding on humanity's stage.   Quanta-Gaia is science, spirituality, and the cosmic unity embracing them both.

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<br clear all><hr>
<a href="#TOC"><img src="../graphics/buttons/upToTOC.gif" align="right" border=0></a>
<center><h1>What is this site all about?  <br> What is Quanta-Gaia?</h1></center>
Welcome to Quanta-Gaia.  You are probably asking yourself:  What is Quanta-Gaia all about?  Well, i'm not sure there's a quick answer to that, but i know you are trying to quickly determine if this site is worthy of your time, so i will be as succinct as possible.  
<p>
This site is about science, it is about spirit and spirituality, it is about philosophy, and it is about how these are all inextricably tied together.  Now right away i have no doubt turned off some of you by mentioning the words "science", "spirituality", and "philosophy" all in the same sentence.  These disciplines have been at war long enough.  More can be learned by uniting them than by continuing the schism.  No doubt that the word "science" is the line of demarcation for most.  After all, it is not "scientific" to talk about spirit or soul, now is it?  And if you are into spirituality, philosophy, or perhaps even the paranormal, you probably take a jaundiced view of anyone talking about science -- those "ignorant", "negative", "skeptical" types.
<p>
Well it's time for this petty bickering to stop.  No matter which side of the fence you are on, there is something to be learned from the other side.  Each side is at an impasse, though neither side really sees it.  I came from the "science" side myself.  I used to deride the "nuts" on the other side.  But a funny thing happened to me on my scientifically self-righteous journey:  i stopped and listened to what science was telling me, and to my surprise it said:  "Hey bud, this world is a lot different than you think.  In fact, nothing is really what it seems."  I then realized that many of today's leading physicists were sounding like mystics, and like the shamans of certain "primitive" societies.
<p>
With this realization, i began to ask the bigger question:  What does this all mean?  And:  How did this come about?  This site is about shedding some light on those questions and coming up with a few answers.  It is partly about laying a scientific basis for spirituality, philosophy, and even the paranormal.  It is also about understanding what science really is, the role it currently plays in our society, and about tempering "scientific" fanaticism.  Not every paper of Quanta-Gaia deals with these issues directly, nor with science.  Some papers are included simply because they are consistent in their overall scope with Quanta-Gaia's ideology.  Examples of this are Mark Twain's essays, and some of the papers in the John Dobson site.
<p>
Science, Spirituality, Philosophy, and even the Paranormal are all complementary disciplines.  Unfortunately, there are charlatans in each who discredit their field.  The paranormal charlatans give it such bad press that i hesitate to even mention it, but i think that there are proportionately as many scientific charlatans in our society.  Unfortunately, the scientific charlatans are socially acceptable so they actually get good press rather than bad.  Being in positions of importance in our society, they may inflict greater social harm than the paranormal charlatans.  Every society has its witch doctors; ours is no different.
<p>
Quanta-Gaia, in summary, is a place where science and spirituality meet and play.  Science alone is not enough for humanity, but any spirituality in opposition to science is nearing the end of its life.  Quanta-Gaia is science, spirituality, and the cosmic wholeness which embraces them both.  It is where mind and matter blend -- where dreams become real and reality is but a dream. 
<br>

<a href="#TOC"><img src="../graphics/buttons/upToTOC.gif" align="right" border=0></a>
<center><h1>What does "Quanta-Gaia" mean?</h1></center>
Quanta-Gaia's etymology is straightforward:  Quanta is from "Quantum Mechanics", a branch of physics dealing with subatomic particles.  Gaia -- also spelled Gaea -- is the Greek goddess of the earth.  In modern usage it refers to the "Gaia Hypothesis" -- the view of the Earth as a living organism.  Quanta-Gaia, while firmly rooted in science, is tempered by a holistic and spiritual view of the Earth and the Cosmos.  (Quanta-Gaia is pronounced:  kwon-tuh gay-uh.)

<br>



The  President in Washington sends word that he wishes to buy our land. But how can  you buy or sell the sky? The land? The idea is strange to us. If we do not own  the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them?
<BR><BR>
Every  part of this earth is sacred to my people. Every shining pine needle,  every sandy shore, every mist  in the dark woods, every meadow, every humming insect. All are holy in the memory  and experience of my people.
<BR><BR>
We know the sap which courses through  the trees as we know the blood that courses through our veins. We are part of  the earth and it is part of us. The perfumed flowers are our sisters, the bear,  the deer, the great eagle, these are our brothers. The rocky crests, the juices  in the meadow, the body heat of the pony, and man, all belong to the same family.
<BR><BR>
The  shining water  that moves in the streams and rivers is not just water, but the blood of our ancestors.  If we sell you our land, you must remember that it is sacred. Each ghostly  reflection in the clear waters of the lakes tells of events and memories  in the life of my people. The water's murmur is the voice of my father's father.  
<BR><BR>
The rivers are our brothers. They quench our thirst, They carry our  canoes and feed our children. So you must give to the rivers the kindness you would  give any brother.
<BR><BR>
If  we sell you our land, remember that the air is precious to us, that the air  shares its spirit with all the life it supports. The wind that gave our grandfather  his first breath also receives his last sigh. The wind also gives our children  the spirit of life. So if we sell you our land, you must keep it apart and  sacred, as a place where man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the  meadow flowers.
<BR><BR>
Will you teach your children what we have taught our children?  That the earth is our  mother? What befalls the earth befalls all the sons of the earth.
<BR><BR>
This  we know: the earth does not belong to man, man belongs to the earth. All things  are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of  life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.  
<BR><BR>
One thing we know: our god is also your god. The earth is precious  to him and to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its creator.
<BR><BR>
Your  destiny is a mystery to us. What  will happen when the buffalo are all slaughtered? The wild horses tamed? What  will happen when the secret corners of the forest are heavy with the scent of  many men and the view of the ripe hills is blotted by talking wires? Where will  the thicket be? Gone! Where will the eagle be? Gone! And what is it to say   goodbye to the swift pony and the hunt? The end of living and the beginning of  survival.
<BR><BR>
When the last Red Man has vanished with his wilderness and his  memory is only the shadow of  a cloud moving across the prairie, will these shores and forests still be here?  Will there be any of the spirit of my people left?
<BR><BR>
We love this earth  as a newborn loves its mother's heartbeat. So, if we sell you our land, love it  as we have loved it. Care for it as we have cared for it. Hold in your mind the  memory of the land as it is when you receive it. Preserve the land for all children  and love it, as God loves us all.
<BR><BR>
As we are part of the land, you  too are part of the land. This  earth is precious to us. It is also precious to you. One thing we know: there  is only one God. No  man, be he Red Man or White Man, can be apart. We <CITE>are</CITE> &nbsp;  brothers after all.

<br>
It was a time of great and exalting excitement. The country was up in arms, the war was on, in every breast burned the holy fire of patriotism; the drums were beating, the bands playing, the toy pistols popping, the bunched firecrackers hissing and spluttering; on every hand and far down the receding and fading spread of roofs and balconies a fluttering wilderness of flags flashed in the sun; daily the young volunteers marched down the wide avenue gay and fine in their new uniforms, the proud fathers and mothers and sisters and sweethearts cheering them with voices choked with happy emotion as they swung by; nightly the packed mass meetings listened, panting, to patriot oratory which stirred the deepest deeps of their hearts, and which they interrupted at briefest intervals with cyclones of applause, the tears running down their cheeks the while; in the churches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country, and invoked the God of Battles beseeching His aid in our good cause in outpourings of fervid eloquence which moved every listener. It was indeed a glad and gracious time, and the half dozen rash spirits that ventured to disapprove of the war and cast a doubt upon its righteousness straightway got such a stern and angry warning that for their personal safety's sake they quickly shrank out of sight and offended no more in that way.
<p>
Sunday morning came -- next day the battalions would leave for the front; the church was filled; the volunteers were there, their young faces alight with martial dreams -- visions of the stern advance, the gathering momentum, the rushing charge, the flashing sabers, the flight of the foe, the tumult, the enveloping smoke, the fierce pursuit, the surrender! Then home from the war, bronzed heroes, welcomed, adored, submerged in golden seas of glory! With the volunteers sat their dear ones, proud, happy, and envied by the neighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send forth to the field of honor, there to win for the flag, or, failing, die the noblest of noble deaths. The service proceeded; a war chapter from the Old Testament was read; the first prayer was said; it was followed by an organ burst that shook the building, and with one impulse the house rose, with glowing eyes and beating hearts, and poured out that tremendous invocation
<p>
<b> <i><center> God the all-terrible! Thou who ordainest! Thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword!</center> </i> </b>  
<p>
Then came the "long" prayer. None could remember the like of it for passionate pleading and moving and beautiful language. The burden of its supplication was, that an ever-merciful and benignant Father of us all would watch over our noble young soldiers, and aid, comfort, and encourage them in their patriotic work; bless them, shield them in the day of battle and the hour of peril, bear them in His mighty hand, make them strong and confident, invincible in the bloody onset; help them to crush the foe, grant to them and to their flag and country imperishable honor and glory -- 
<p>
An aged stranger entered and moved with slow and noiseless step up the main aisle, his eyes fixed upon the minister, his long body clothed in a robe that reached to his feet, his head bare, his white hair descending in a frothy cataract to his shoulders, his seamy face unnaturally pale, pale even to ghastliness. With all eyes following him and wondering, he made his silent way; without pausing, he ascended to the preacher's side and stood there waiting. With shut lids the preacher, unconscious of his presence, continued with his moving prayer, and at last finished it with the words, uttered in fervent appeal, "Bless our arms, grant us the victory, O Lord our God, Father and Protector of our land and flag!" 
<p>
The stranger touched his arm, motioned him to step aside -- which the startled minister did -- and took his place. During some moments he surveyed the spellbound audience with solemn eyes, in which burned an uncanny light; then in a deep voice he said: 
<p>
"I come from the Throne -- bearing a message from Almighty God!"  The words smote the house with a shock; if the stranger perceived it he gave no attention. "He has heard the prayer of His servant your shepherd, and will grant it if such shall be your desire after I, His messenger, shall have explained to you its import -- that is to say, its full import. For it is like unto many of the prayers of men, in that it asks for more than he who utters it is aware of -- except he pause and think.
<p>
"God's servant and yours has prayed his prayer. Has he paused and taken thought? Is it one prayer? No, it is two -- one uttered, the other not. Both have reached the ear of Him Who heareth all supplications, the spoken and the unspoken. Ponder this -- keep it in mind. If you would beseech a blessing upon yourself, beware! lest without intent you invoke a curse upon a neighbor at the same time. If you pray for the blessing of rain upon your crop which needs it, by that act you are possibly praying for a curse upon some neighbor's crop which may not need rain and can be injured by it.
<p>
"You have heard your servant's prayer -- the uttered part of it. I am commissioned of God to put into words the other part of it -- that part which the pastor -- and also you in your hearts -- fervently prayed silently. And ignorantly and unthinkingly? God grant that it was so! You heard these words:  'Grant us the victory, O Lord our God!'  That is sufficient. the <i>whole </i> &nbsp of the uttered prayer is compact into those pregnant words. Elaborations were not necessary. When you have prayed for victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results which follow victory --<i> must </i> &nbsp follow it, cannot help but follow it. Upon the listening spirit of God fell also the unspoken part of the prayer. He commandeth me to put it into words. Listen!
<p>
"O Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go forth to battle -- be Thou near them! With them -- in spirit -- we also go forth from the sweet peace of our beloved firesides to smite the foe. O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.
<p>
[<i>After a pause.</i> &nbsp] "Ye have prayed it; if ye still desire it, speak! -- The messenger of the Most High waits!" 
<p>
It was believed afterward that the man was a lunatic, because there was no sense in what he said.

Albert Bigelow Paine first published extracts from "The War Prayer" in his 1912 biography of Mark Twain with the comment that the author said he had been urged not to publish it.   According to Paine, Mark Twain acceded to its suppression by stating, "I have told the whole truth in that, and only dead mean can tell the truth in this world.  It can be published after I am dead."  A full text was collected in <cite> Europe and Elsewhere </cite> &nbsp (1923).

<br>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspI will say again, and yet again, and still again, that a good deed-- <p>
<i>The Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspPeace, oh man of narrow vision! There is no such thing as a good <i>deed</i>&nbsp--<p>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspO shameless blasphe--<p>
<i>The Offensive Stranger:</i>&nbspAnd no such thing as an evil deed.  There are good <i>impulses,
 </i>&nbspthere are evil impulses, and that is all. Half of the results of a good intention are evil; half the results of an evil intention are good. No man can command the results, nor allot them.<p>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspAnd so--<p>
<i>The Offensive Stranger:</i>&nbspAnd so you shall praise men for their good intentions, and not blame them for the evils resulting; you shall blame men for their evil intentions, and not praise them for the good resulting.<p>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspO, maniac! will you say-- <p>
<i>The Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspListen to the law:  From <i>every </i>&nbspimpulse, whether good or evil, flows two streams; the one carries health, the other carries poison. From the beginning of time this law has not changed, to the end of time it will not change.<p>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspIf I should strike thee dead in anger-- <p>
<i>The Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspOr kill me with a drug which you hoped would give me new life and strength--<p>
<i>The Dervish:</i>&nbspVery well. Go on.<p>
<i>The Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspIn either case the results would be
 the same. Age-long misery of mind for you -- an evil result; peace, repose, the
 end of sorrow for me -- a good result. Three hearts that hold me dear would break;
 three pauper cousins of the third remove would get my riches and rejoice;
 you would go to prison and your friends would grieve, but your humble apprentice-priest
 would step into your shoes and your fat sleek life and be happy. And are
 these all the goods and all
 the evils that would flow from the well-intended or ill-intended act that cut short
 my life? Oh thoughtless one, Oh purblind creature! the good and evil results
 that flow from <i>any </i>&nbspact, even the smallest, breed on and on, century
 after century, forever and ever and ever, creeping by inches around the globe,
 affecting all its coming and going populations until the end of time, until
 the final cataclysm! <p>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspThen, there being no such
 thing as a good deed-- <p>
<i>The
 Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspDon't I tell you there are good <i>intentions,
 </i>&nbspand evil ones, and there an end? The <i>results </i>&nbspare not
 foreseeable. They are of both kinds, in all cases. It is the law. Listen:  this
 is far-western history:  <p>
<center><h3> Voices Out of Utah <br>
I</h3></center><br>
<i>The White
 Chief (to his people):  </i>&nbspThis wide plain was a desert.  By our heaven-blest
 industry we have dammed the river and utilized its waters and turned the desert
 into smiling fields whose
 fruitage makes prosperous and happy a thousand homes where poverty and hunger
 dwelt before. How noble, how beneficent, is Civilization!<p>
<center> <h3> II</h3></center><br>
<i>Indian
 Chief (to his people):  </i>&nbspThis wide plain, which the Spanish priests
 taught our fathers to irrigate, was a smiling field, whose fruitage made our
 homes prosperous and happy. The white American has dammed our river, taken away
 our water for his own valley, and turned our field into a desert; wherefore
 we starve.<p>
<p>
<i>The Dervish:</i>&nbspI perceive that the good intention did really bring both good and
 evil results in equal measure. But a single case cannot prove the rule. Try again.<p>
<i>The
 Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspPardon me, <i>all </i>&nbspcases
 prove it Columbus discovered a new world and gave to the plodding poor and the
 landless of Europe farms and breathing-space and plenty and happiness--<p>
<i>The
 Dervish:  </i>&nbspA good result--<p>
<i>The Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspAnd
 they hunted and harried the
 original owners of the soil, and robbed them, beggared them, drove them from
 their homes, and exterminated them, root and branch.<p>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspAn
 evil result, yes.<p>
<i>The Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspThe French Revolution
 brought desolation to the hearts and homes of five million families and
 drenched the country with blood and turned its wealth to poverty.<p>
<i>The
 Dervish:  </i>&nbspAn evil result<p>
<i>The Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspBut
 every great and precious liberty
 enjoyed by the nations of Continental Europe today are the gift of that Revolution.
 <p>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspA good result, I concede it. <p>
<i>The
 Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspIs our well-meant effort to lift up the Filipino
 to our own moral altitude with a musket, we have slipped on the ice and fallen
 down to his.<p>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspA large evil result.<p>
<i>The Offensive
 Stranger:  </i>&nbspBut as an offset we are a World Power.<p>
<i>The
 Dervish:  </i>&nbspGive me time.
 I must think this one over. Pass on.<p>
<i>The Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspBy
 help of three hundred thousand soldiers and eight hundred million dollars England
 has succeeded in her good purpose of lifting up the unwilling Boers and making
 them better and purer and happier than they could ever have become by their
 own devices.<p>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspCertainly that is a good result. <p>
<i>The
 Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspBut there are only eleven Boers left,
 now.<p>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspIt
 has the appearance of an evil result. But I will think it over before I
 decide.<p>
<i>The Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspTake yet one more instance. With
 the best intentions the missionary has been laboring in China for eighty years.<p>
<i>The
 Dervish:  </i>&nbspThe evil result is-- <p>
<i>The Offensive
 Stranger:  </i>&nbspThat nearly a hundred thousand Chinamen have acquired our Civilization.<p>
<i>The Dervish:  </i>&nbspAnd the good result is-- <p>
<i>The
 Offensive Stranger:  </i>&nbspThat
 by the compassion of God four hundred millions have escaped it.<p>
<i>The
 Dervish:  </i>&nbspAdieu, good sir; I am convinced, and accept your Law.

<br>
I have not read Nietzsche or Ibsen, nor any other philosopher, and have not needed to do it, and have not desired to do it; I have gone to the fountainhead for information -- that is to say, to the human race. Every man is in his own person the whole human race, with not a detail lacking. I am the whole human race without a detail lacking; I have studied the human race with diligence and strong interest all these years in my own person; in myself I find in big or little proportion every quality and every defect that is findable in the mass of the race. I knew I should not find in any philosophy a single thought which had not passed through my own head, nor a single thought which had not passed through the heads of millions and millions of men before I was born; I knew I should not find a single original thought in any philosophy, and I knew I could not furnish one to the world myself, if I had five centuries to invent it in.  Nietzsche published his book and was at once pronounced crazy by the world -- by a world which included tens of thousands of bright, sane men who believed exactly as Nietzsche believed, but concealed the fact, and scoffed at Nietzsche. What a coward every man is! and how surely he will find it out if he will just let other people alone and sit down and examine himself. The human race is a race of cowards; and I am not only marching in that procession but carrying a banner.

<TITLE>As Regards Patriotism</TITLE>

<META NAME="description" CONTENT="As Regards Patriotism is a brief, insightful, and critical commentary by Mark Twain regarding patriotism.  Twain asserts: 'Patriotism is merely a religion.'">
<META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="As Regards Patriotism, Mark Twain, humanity, philosophy, politics, religion">

<a name="TOP"></a><center><STRONG><H1>As Regards Patriotism</H1></STRONG></center>

<center><h3>by Mark Twain <br>(circa 1900)</h3> </center>

<center><IMG SRC="../../graphics/dividers/waveline.gif" align=center></center><p>
<a href="#END"><img src="../../graphics/buttons/downArrow.gif" align="right" border=0></a>

<br>
It is agreed, in this country, that if a man can arrange his religion so that it perfectly satisfies his conscience, it is not incumbent upon him to care whether the arrangement is satisfactory to any one else or not.
<p>
In Austria and some other countries this is not the case. There the State arranges a man's religion for him, he has no voice in it himself.
<p>
Patriotism is merely a religion -- love of country, worship of country, devotion to the country's flag and honor and welfare.
<p>
In absolute monarchies it is furnished from the Throne, cut and dried, to the subject; in England and America it is furnished, cut and dried, to the citizen by the politician and the newspaper.
<p>
The newspaper-and-politician-manufactured Patriot often gags in private over his dose; but he takes it, and keeps it on his stomach the best he can. Blessed are the meek.
<p>
Sometimes, in the beginning of an insane and shabby political upheaval, he is strongly moved to revolt, but he doesn't do it -- he knows better. He knows that his maker would find it out -- the maker of his Patriotism, the windy and incoherent six-dollar sub-editor of his village newspaper -- and would bray out in print and call him a Traitor. And how dreadful that would be. It makes him tuck his tail between his legs and shiver. We all know -- the reader knows it quite well -- that two or three years ago nine-tenths of the human tails in England and America performed just that act. Which is to say, nine-tenths of the Patriots in England and America turned Traitor to keep from being called Traitor. Isn't it true? You know it to be true. Isn't it curious?
<p>
Yet it was not a thing to be very seriously ashamed of. A man can seldom -- very, very seldom -- fight a winning fight against his training; the odds are too heavy. For many a year -- perhaps always -- the training of the two nations had been dead against independence in political thought, persistently inhospitable toward Patriotism manufactured on a man's own premises, Patriotism reasoned out in the man's own head and fire-assayed and tested and proved in his own conscience. The resulting Patriotism was a shop-worn product procured at second hand. The Patriot did not know just how or when or where he got his opinions, neither did he care, so long as he was with what seemed the majority -- which was the main thing, the safe thing, the comfortable thing. Does the reader believe he knows three men who have actual reasons for their pattern of Patriotism --  and can furnish them? Let him not examine, unless he wants to be disappointed. He will be likely to find that his men got their Patriotism at the public trough, and had no hand in their preparation themselves.
<p>
Training does wonderful things. It moved the people of this country to oppose the Mexican war; then moved them to fall in with what they supposed was the opinion of the majority -- majority-Patriotism is the customary Patriotism -- and go down there and fight. Before the Civil War it made the North indifferent to slavery and friendly to the slave interest; in that interest it made Massachusetts hostile to the American flag, and she would not allow it to be hoisted on her State House -- in her eyes it was the flag of a faction. Then by and by, training swung Massachusetts the other way, and she went raging South to fight under that very flag and against that foretime protected-interest of hers.
<p>
Training made us nobly anxious to free Cuba; training made us give her a noble promise; training has enabled us to take it back. Long training made us revolt at the idea of wantonly taking any weak nation's country and liberties away from it, a short training has made us glad to do it, and proud of having done it. Training made us loathe Weyler's cruel concentration camps,* training has persuaded us to prefer them to any other device for winning the love of our "wards."
<p>
There is nothing that training cannot do. Nothing is above its reach or below it. It can turn bad morals to good, good morals to bad; it can destroy principles, it can re-create them; it can debase angels to men and lift men to angelship. And it can do any one of these miracles in a year -- even in six months.
<p>
Then men can be trained to manufacture their own Patriotism. They can be trained to labor it out in their own heads and hearts, and in the privacy and independence of their own premises. It can train them to stop taking it by command, as the Austrian takes his religion.
<br>

<br>
Treat me kindly, my beloved master for no heart in the world is more grateful for kindness than the loving heart of me.
<p>
Do not break my spirit with a stick, for though I lick your hand between the blows, your patience and understanding will more quickly teach me the things you would have me do.
<p>
Speak to me often, for your voice is the world's sweetest music, as you must know by the fierce wagging of my tail when your footstep falls upon my waiting ear.
<p>
When it is cold and wet, please take me inside, for I am now a domesticated animal, no longer used to bitter elements. And I ask no greater glory than the privilege of sitting at your feet beside the hearth. Though had you no home, I would rather follow you through ice and snow than rest upon the softest pillow in the warmest home in all the land, for you are my god, and I am your devoted worshiper.
<p>
Keep my pan filled with fresh water, for although I should not reproach you were it dry, I cannot tell you when I suffer thirst.
<p>
Feed me clean food, that I may well, to romp and play and do your bidding, to walk by your side, and stand ready, willing and able to protect you with my life should your life be in danger.
<p>
And, beloved master, should the Great Master see fit to deprive me of my health or sight, do not turn me away from you. Rather hold me gently in your arms as skilled hands grant me the merciful boon of eternal rest... and I will leave you knowing with the last breath I drew, my fate was ever safest in your hands.

As  you are probably aware, the computer industry is complex, dynamic, and  in a state of constant change.  It is difficult for industry professionals to keep  up with the swift changes, so it's no wonder that the average person feels  overwhelmed when faced with the prospect of purchasing computer equipment.  It  isn't possible to give you a set  of strict rules that will tell you exactly what to buy, but we can give you some  general guidelines that will reduce your anxiety levels and help make you a  savvy buyer.  These guidelines are useful for first time buyers as well as more  seasoned buyers.  They apply to complete systems, peripherals, and upgrades.
<p>
When  purchasing a system for home, relying on this article and your own common  sense probably will give you a good value for your money, even if you know nothing  about computers.  Typical  home use is general purpose in nature, so most computer systems are adequate  for the task.  What is usually most important in the home environment are factors  such as ease of use/ease of learning, and compatibility with the office or school.
<p>
When  purchasing a system for business, your decision is usually more  complex and wrong decisions can be costly.  There is the obvious danger of not  making a cost effective purchase, such as buying more computer power than is needed  or buying something that will  not be used.  But there is an even larger risk lurking in the shadows of your  decision -- one that you will pay for repeatedly throughout the life of your  equipment:  lost productivity because the system is difficult to learn or use,  or because it is not well suited to your needs.
<p>
<h3>Step 1:  Determine your needs</h3>
<p>
Before  you decide what computer equipment to buy, you first need to define  what you want it to do.  A computer is just a tool, like a shovel or a pan.  While  all shovels can be used to  dig, and all pans can be used to prepare food, there are different kinds of shovels  and different kinds of pans.  Some varieties are better suited than others  for various tasks.  Likewise, some computers are better suited for certain applications  than others.
<p>
When defining what you want your computer system to  do, you should commit your list to paper.  Write down your major anticipated uses.   It isn't necessary to list every conceivable use you might make of your new  computer, but it is important  that you list the major ones.  You are creating this list to help you determine  what hardware and software will best do the job at the lowest cost.
<p>
Every  business and every home is different, so your list of needs will vary from that  of your friends, associates, and competitors.  For example, most businesses will  want to do a minimum of word processing and accounting.  Others may include  inventory, database management, desktop publishing, forecasting, graphics,  bulk mailing, or other tasks.   Many students will want to do word processing and communications (to connect  with online databases and library catalog systems).  Others might need to do complex  mathematical computations -- or at least be able to write complex mathematical  equations in a word processing environment.
<p>
<h3>Step 2:  Determine the Critical  Issues</h3>
<p>
While the choice of computer may sound like your most important  and complex decision, it may not be.  The computer itself is not your tool, the  system as a whole is your tool.   Like a chain, it is only as good as its weakest link.  For example, if you  were in the business of publishing a newsletter, you would be concerned about the  quality of your hardcopy.  The printer you use may be the most important component  of your system.  But having the best printer in the world will do you little  good unless your computer can:  a) use it, and b) use it to its fullest potential.   Equally important is the software available on your computer.  It does  little good to have all this  hardware if the software available to you can't do what you need it to do.
<p>
As  you can see, we must identify those elements that are the most critical or important.   Is ease of use and ease of learning the most important features?  Perhaps  the ability to do complex mathematical calculations or color graphics?  Prioritize  your list of needs.  You will be configuring your system around whatever  you identify as your critical issues.  
<p>
<h3>Step 3:  Should you seek advice?</h3>
<p>
Everyone  can benefit from good  advice.  The less you know about something, the more valuable good advice is  to you -- and the more dependent upon it you are.  Bad advice, when acted upon,  can be costly.  Novices are the ones who most need good advice, and the ones who  are at the greatest risk of getting bad advice, because their lack of knowledge  makes it difficult to distinguish bad advice from good.  Unfortunately, bad  advice can come from any source, including well meaning individuals who are only  trying to help.  
<p>
If you  have some experience with computers, you'll probably be fairly comfortable relying  on your own expertise.  If you don't have this level of comfort or know nothing  about computers, you'll probably be relying pretty heavily upon the advice  of others.  To help you ferret out the bad from the good, we'll examine the pro's  and con's of your likely sources of advice:  articles, consultants, salespeople,  friends and associates.  Each situation is different, but if you follow the  steps outlined in this article  and temper it with your own wisdom and the advice you get, you'll probably do  well.
<p>
Much useful information can be found in articles of various publications.   Generally, the major publications tend to have sound advice.  Smaller publications  sometimes have dubious advice, however, because they tend to be less  selective of their authors.  Naturally, <strong>this publication</strong> has some  of the best advice we've seen <strong>anywhere ;-)</strong>.  A major drawback  of any article, however,  is that it is not interactive.  You cannot ask the author:  "yes, but what if...".   Articles can be very useful in making you more computer literate.
<p>
Salespeople  can be a source of good information.  Many are very knowledgeable and can  facilitate your decision making process.  Others are bald-faced liars that slither  with the snakes.  You may not stand a chance of telling the difference between  the two unless you have a fair amount of knowledge yourself.  No matter how  honest the salesperson, they all  have an incentive to sell you something.  Many will have your best interests  at heart, while others will encourage you to buy the brand that has the larger  profit margin for them.
<p>
Friends and associates generally have your best interests  at heart, but that doesn't mean that they are qualified to give good advice.   Many friends may think they know a lot about computers, and you might think  so too, but in reality their knowledge may not be much more than yours.  Given  how quickly this industry  changes, unless your friends are computer professionals, their advice is probably  limited.  Just because Sally bought brand x and is very happy with it, it does  not mean that you also should buy brand x, although that is what Sally is likely  to recommend.  Though she is very smart, Sally may not have bought as good  of a system as she could have, or her needs might be different from yours.  Besides,  unless Sally bought her system within the last month or two, it's a good  bet that there are new models  on the market and that prices have gone down.  Taking the advice of your pal who  "knows a lot about computers" could cost you some money.  On the other hand,  they can keep you from getting ripped off.  Listen to their advice, but don't take  it as gospel.  You're the one who must live with your choices.
<p>
A good consultant  probably will save you some money and give you the best advice you are  likely to encounter.  Unfortunately, not all consultants are good, so if you do  engage one, ask lots of questions  up front.  Be suspicious of a consultant who doesn't give you a free initial  consultation.  Most charge hourly and may ask for a retainer up front.  You  may resist the notion of hiring a consultant because of their expense, however,  if you have chosen your consultant well, they are probably your best source of  knowledgeable, unbiased advice.
<p>
In the end, all sources of information have  their limitations.  Listen to them all and to your instinct.  If you're careful,  you'll probably make the right  choice.
<p>
<h3>Step 4:  What to buy</h3>
<p>
The next step is to create a generic list  of the components of your system.  Don't get into the specifics of which brand  or model, just identify components such as computer, monitor, printer, modem,  word processor, spreadsheet, etc.  Put a question mark by anything you think you  might need but are unsure about.  Use your list of needs to help figure out these  components.  Here is where a friend or consultant could be of great help if  you are a novice with computers.
<p>
Now  you will begin to refine your list.  Look at your critical issues.   What is the most important issue and which component directly affects it?  For  example, if you have identified high quality output as your most critical item,  then the component that most directly affects it is the output device (e.g. a  printer).  If ease of use is your critical issue, then start by choosing a computer  model that excels in this area, such as Macintosh.  Continue to refine your  list based your critical issues.   If you follow this approach, those items at the top of your list are where  you should invest in higher quality, whereas you can economize more on those items  at the bottom of the list.  
<p>
Remember, it is critical that you continue  to think of your system as a whole -- that is your real tool.  We are often tempted  to think of our computer or microprocessor as the tool.  This is equivalent  to thinking of the engine in our car as a transportation tool.  While the engine  is an important component,  an automobile without something as humble as tires is probably not going to serve  us very well.
<p>
Once you have completed your critical issues list and have  identified what you wish to purchase, you must then decide when and where to make  your purchase.  Next issue we'll compare the pro's and con's of dealers, discounters,  and mail order.  In this issue, the article:  "Buy Now, or Wait for Lower  Prices?" contains some insight into making cost effective purchase decisions  in the fast paced computer market.   Before finalizing your equipment purchase list, you'll probably want to  read this article.

<br>
Should  you purchase a computer system now, or wait until prices  come down?  Is it wise to plan ahead and buy for future needs?  Over the past  decade, computers have continuously become more powerful, and prices on any given  model always plummet throughout its life cycle.  There is no sign of this cycle  ending -- if anything it appears to have accelerated.  This is great for consumers,  but it also creates a dilemma  for them:  if you buy today, your purchase will depreciate rapidly and quickly  become obsolete; deferring a purchase, however, means you will face the  same situation later.  The best solution to this riddle, therefore, is to purchase  today exactly what you need today -- but no more!  There are caveats to this  rule of thumb, however.
<p>
We are assuming that you do not have certain knowledge  of imminent price cuts or technology announcements.  If you do, common sense  should dictate your actions.   Generally speaking, if you need the equipment today, deferring purchases until  the price drops may be the wrong move.  You could lose money due to lost productivity  or by allowing your competition to become more efficient.  It is very difficult  to quantify lost productivity -- the cost of not having the proper tools  for the job.  This is especially true if your competition does have the tools  it needs.  It's a pretty good bet that between two ditch digging companies, the  one with a single back hole will  be more effective and profitable than the one with only a hundred garden shovels  -- it's the tools, the back hole, which makes the difference. 
<p>
On the other  hand, if you don't need it now, wait until you do before you buy.  Naturally,  you have to consider many variables, such as availability of cash, availability  of product, and any delays in your procurement process.  In other words, initiate  the order so that the equipment arrives when your projected needs become  acute.  Ideally, your order will  coincide with a recent price cut, but don't count on it.
<p>
Another implication  of this rule of thumb is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, one should  not buy more capacity or capability than what is needed today (e.g.  buying a  more powerful computer to address next year's needs).  For most purchases, we usually  consider our current needs as well as future needs.  This is usually a prudent  course of action since most of our major investments don't depreciate 35%  or more a year and become obsolete  within two years (or less).  Consider this example:  a year ago, 128Mb magneto  optical (MO) drives cost around $1800.  Today they are half that price.   If your needs today can be met by a 128Mb MO drive, but you think that you might  need a 256Mb MO drive next year, then buy the $900 128Mb drive today and pass  on the $1800 256Mb drive.  Next year you'll probably be able to buy that 256Mb  drive for $900.  Either way you will have spent $1800 total, but by deferring  your purchase you'll end up with  two drives, instead of one, and your second drive probably will be better technology  (next year) than what you can buy today.  You also will have been able  to earn interest on $900 for one year.  Additionally, you could sell your 128Mb  drive to offset the purchase of the newer drive and have a tax write off on the  "loss" you sustained on the 128Mb drive.  (You came out ahead, but the IRS sees  it as a loss.)
<p>
There are times when this strategy doesn't apply, however.   Consider tape backup drives.   Today you can purchase a 600Mb tape drive for about $700.  Spend another $250  and you'll have a 2.1Gb DAT drive.  The 600Mb drive is adequate for your current  needs, so why pay more for the higher capacity drive you do not yet need?  There  are actually several reasons.  The 600Mb drive has less than a third the capacity  of the 2.1Gb drive, but that difference is hardly reflected in the price  of the two drives.  The DAT drive is more than 50% faster and the technology is  probably more reliable.  The  cost of the DAT tapes is half that of the 600Mb tapes (making the DAT tapes, on  a per Mb basis, more than six times cheaper).  Clearly the cheaper media shrinks  the $250 margin in the drives.  Additionally, DAT tapes are smaller and take  less storage space.  Finally, DAT tapes are likely to be widely available far  longer (and at a lower cost) that the 600Mb tapes.
<p>
As with any rule of thumb,  there are exceptions as the tape drive scenario illustrates.  Use your own best  judgement, but beware the temptation  of buying for the future.  More often than not, buying for future needs in the computer industry will cost you money, not save it.

<TITLE>A Poor Person's Scanner</TITLE>

<BR>
Ever  wish you had a scanner, but just can't  justify spending that much money for something that you'll use only occasionally?   That's how we felt.  If you have a fax modem, you have all the making's  of a poor person's scanner.
<p>
We recently had the need to digitize Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam."  We were interested in a line art image of the area of Adam's hand reaching out to the hand of God.  Our local library provided us with many books that had the image we wanted to digitize.  Some were in color, some in black and white.  We took our books to many shops that advertised custom scanning services.  These firms ranged from graphic artist shops with computers and scanners, to quick print shops that offered scanning services.  Some were Mac based, others said they could transfer it to a Mac compatible disc.
<p>
Some estimates we received were based on the number of images we wanted scanned.  Others were based on an hourly rate with a minimum charge.  The lowest fee we were quoted was $15.  Some quotes were a minimum of $25 if everything went "well."  All shops expressed reservations about their ability to complete job to our satisfaction; none of them would allow us to operate the scanners ourselves.  We have used scanners before and did not think that our request was terribly difficult.
<p>
We engaged a seemly more competent firm who promised us to give it a try and, if we weren't happy, there would be no charge.  Forty five minutes later, we were no closer to a usable product than when we had started.  We were about to begin the whole process anew when we had our brainstorm.  We made a few photocopies of our desired image, got the line art image we wanted on our photocopy, and faxed it to our own fax modem using "fine" mode.  The image came out perfectly and is exactly what we wanted.  We had our choice of high quality "laser" photocopiers, but opted to use a standard optical photocopier in-stead.  The key was to get exactly the image we wanted on paper before faxing it to our Mac.
<p>
The only special equipment you need is a fax modem connected to your Mac or IBM. You do not need a fax machine or photocopier.  You can use the 5¢ a copy photocopier at your local quick print shop or grocery store.  It does not have to be a state of the art photocopier, it only needs to produce a good, clean image.  Many quick copy shops, office supply stores and even grocery stores offer fax services.  Typical prices for a local-call fax is $1 (though many places are willing to charge you more).  Your local library or college may offer free local faxes.  Wherever you fax from, make sure that the fax is transmitted via the highest quality mode available (this is usually "fine" mode).  A trick to boost the resolution, if the image is small enough, is to use an enlarging photocopier to blow-up the image you will fax.  Once received, the image can be reduced on the Mac.

Would you like to have a dedicated fax phone number but don't have enough fax traffic to justify the additional expense of a dedicated fax line?  Fax switches aren't the answer.  They don't give you that dedicated fax phone number.  They are not graceful in operation -- anyone who faxes or calls you will get the impression that you are a small time operation.  They also do not allow you to use the toll-saver feature on your answering machine.  
<p>
Would you like to have a dedicated data modem phone number, but again don't have enough traffic to justify the additional expense of a dedicate line?  Operating more than one business out of your home?  Would you like to have separate numbers for each business, but once again can't justify the expense of an extra line?  There may be a low cost solution in your area to all of these problems.
<p>
Many local phone companies offer a service that may be named "Custom Ringing", "Distinctive Ringing", "IdentaRing", "RingMaster", "Multi-Ring", "RingMate", "Personalized Ring", "SmartRing", "Ident-A-Call", or something similar.  Here's how it works:  the phone company assigns multiple phone numbers to a single phone line.  Each number rings through to that single line, but the ring pattern varies for each number dialed.  The ring pattern for your primary number might be "long", whereas the ring pattern for your second number might be "short-short".  The service is marketed as a method to determine for whom the call is intended before the phone is actually answered.  With the right equipment, hardware can decipher the ring pattern and automatically route the call to the appropriate device.  
<p>
The right equipment is called the "ASAP RD 4000 Ring Decipher" by Command Communications, Inc.  The Ring Decipher listens to the incoming ring pattern for one of the four it knows:  long, short-short, short-short-long, and short-long-short.  When it identifies the ring pattern (usually after the first ring), it flips a relay and routes the call out via one of its modular jacks in the back of the unit.  That device then sees an incoming ring (usually with the second ring) and responds normally.  The Ring Decipher has four LED's on the front that show which ring pattern was identified.
<p>
The Ring Decipher can make for some interesting telephone connections.  If, for example, you wanted to operate two businesses off of one line, each with separate phone numbers, you might connect two different answering machines to the ring decipher (so that you would have a separate outgoing message for each business).  But then you may just want to use a single two-line answering machine instead.
<p>
AT&amp;T makes a similar device but it's more costly and only decipher's two ring patterns.  They make an even more expensive version which handles up to three.  Most AT&amp;T phone center stores will deny they make such a widget, but it is available through their 800 mail order catalog service.
<p>
We had a devil of a time tracking down this little widget.  Most people we spoke to thought we were asking for the more commonplace (and inferior) fax switch.  A fax switch operates by answering the incoming call regardless of ring pattern, waits five seconds for a fax carrier, and then switches a relay based on what it heard.  It's pretty obvious at the other end of the phone line what's going on, and it smacks of smallness.  It's often in a small business's best interests not to appear as small as they really are.  The Ring Decipher, on the other hand, offers a clean, professional solution with more versatility.
<p>
You can order the Ring Decipher from J&amp;R Music World in Maspeth, NY.  Their phone number is:  800-221-8180.  Their part number is:  CMD RD4000.  When last we heard, they were selling it for $79.95 plus shipping and handling.
<p>
Command Communications, Inc., Aurora, CO, (303) 751-7000, FAX:  (303) 750-6437. 
<p>
<strong>Important Update:</strong> Since this article was originally written, we have some new information.  First, these ring deciphering devices are becoming more common and easier to find.  This is good since the long-term reliability of the Ring Decipher (by Command Communications) doesn't seem to be very good.  Our unit has progressively deteriorated over the last year and a half.  It started with one of the four LED's failure to light (a minor problem).  Now two LED's fail to light, and it has been implicated in some modem difficulties we were having.  Specifically, we began to experience intermittent problems in connecting or staying connected at higher speeds (i.e. 28.8K baud).  When we could connect, it was usually at 21.6K baud or slower.  Removal of the Ring Decipher completely eliminated the problem.
<p>
Hello Direct in San Jose, California offers two alternatives to the Ring Decipher:  "SR3" at $99 and "Ring Selector" at $45.  The SR3 has three ports on the back (compared to the Ring Decipher's four), whereas the Ring Selector is a single port device, requiring a Ring Selector for each device, but can be set for one of three different ring patterns.  <strong>We have not evaluated either of these units; this is not an endorsement.</strong>  Hello Direct can be reached at:  800-444-3556.

<br>

Tax season may be past us for this year, and many of us  won't worry about it again until next April.  For many, tax season means gathering  up the receipts and taking them to our accountant.  That attitude, however,  is guaranteed to cost you money -- especially if you are a small business.  Here  is our step by step guide to saving your tax dollars.
<p>
<h3>Step 1:  Buy Tax Software</h3>
<p>
If  you own a small business  or file any personal tax return form more complicated than from 1040EZ, you  should buy tax preparation software.  MacInTax by ChipSoft is the package to  beat.  (For DOS users, ChipSoft manufactures TurboTax.)  For more information  on MacInTax, see our review in this issue.
<p>
Even if you hire a professional  tax preparer, you should still purchase this software and run through the numbers  yourself.  Start from scratch with the same information you provided your preparer.   If during the course  of figuring your taxes, you discover receipts or information you didn't provide  to your preparer, include that in your calculations but make a list of such information.   Also, mark this data as "estimated" in MacInTax.  When you are done,  your numbers should either be lower or higher than your tax preparer's -- it is  unlikely it will be exactly the same.
<p>
If your tax numbers are higher or close  to your preparer's, that speaks well of your preparer.  If your numbers are  significantly lower than your  preparer's, then you are paying too much in taxes and you need to figure out why.   If there were no new information that you had that your preparer didn't, you  ought to be asking your preparer some difficult questions and questioning the  value of their services.
<p>
If there were new information, you need to put you  and your tax preparer on a level playing field.  Go back and change all those  "estimated" values to zero.  If this yields numbers favorable to your tax preparer,  then your method of record  keeping or your own understanding of tax law may be costing you money.
<p>
The  very least that you will gain from this entire exercise is a better appreciation  for what is deductible and how it affects your tax expense.  It will train  you, as the decision maker in your business or household, what is favorable taxwise  and empower you to make better tax related decisions.  It also will give  you a gauge by which to rate your tax preparer and, if nothing else, make you  feel more comfortable that you  are getting good service from them.
<p>
<h3>Step 2:  Understand Your Tax Return and Deductions</h3>
<p>
I engaged a CPA to prepare my taxes for several years.  The first  year we both figured my taxes (though she didn't know it) and she saved me about  $900.  This more than paid for her fee.  By carefully reading and understanding  the work she did for me, my knowledge of what was deductible and what wasn't  improved.  I was better prepared to understand the tax consequences of my business  decisions and therefore impact  my overall profitability.
<p>
Years later, when MacInTax came along, it allowed  me to do my own taxes for about the same amount of effort required to collect  and prepare records for the accountant.  I now prepare my own taxes because  it allows me to kept abreast of tax law and my business decisions are sounder  as a result.  Even if you have someone else prepare your taxes, it is still essential  that you understand tax law and the tax consequences of everyday decisions  that you make in your business.   Failure to do so can be costly.
<p>
While my accountant was a tax specialist,  she didn't always make the best choices for me in a particular year.  I knew  that my computer equipment purchases were tax deductible, but no one told me  that normally those deductions would be spread over a five year period.  Now five  years is an unlikely long time for a computer professional to keep a machine,  but my accountant didn't know that.  I didn't know that a ¤179 deduction would  allow me to deduct 100% of the  cost in one year.  My ignorance cost me money.
<p>
<h3>Step 3:  Implement a Process  for Collecting and Keeping Tax Records</h3>
<p>
Most businesses and households count  themselves lucky to be able to find their receipts come April, but a spreadsheet  application and a little assiduous attention throughout the year can make the  whole process simple and painless.  Every business and household that has a  computer system should have spreadsheet software.
<p>
Spreadsheets are versatile  and powerful, and are extremely  useful in the collection and analysis of tax information.  For example, if  you use your automobile for business purposes, every mile you drive is a tax deduction.   Use a spreadsheet to create a chart with columns for the date, time,  miles driven (if you use a trip meter, otherwise for starting and ending mileage),  destination, purpose of trip, etc.  Print out a blank copy of the spreadsheet  to carry with you in your car.  As you use it, fill in the appropriate cells.   At the end of the day or week,  enter the information into your computer.  At the start of a new year, you begin  a new spreadsheet.  Come tax time, you pull up your spreadsheet for the tax  year in question and enter the total mileage into the appropriate box in MacInTax.
<p>
If you are using a Macintosh running System 7, you can make things even  easier by using publish and subscribe to automate the process for you.  From  your spreadsheet, merely publish the cell containing the total mileage (use a  label such as "1993 Mileage").   When you pull up MacInTax, merely subscribe to the published spreadsheet total  from the appropriate cell in MacInTax.  Warning:  when you start a new spreadsheet,  it is very important that the new spreadsheet doesn't publish to last year's  label.  This problem can be easily avoided if you create a stationery pad  containing a blank mileage spreadsheet without the total being published.  When  you start your new year, you merely click on your stationery pad, select a new  name, and publish the total to  a new label.
<p>
Clearly, this example could be applied to many other tax record  keeping tasks, such as improvements you make to your house (you can deduct from  the sale price of your home all the money you have put into improving it over  the years, such as remodeling, landscaping, etc.), utility bills (for a home  office deduction), nickels you plug into photocopy machines, parking meters, etc.
<p>
<h3>Step  4:  Use a Tax Professional as Appropriate</h3>
<p>
Should you use a tax consultant  or a tax preparer?  Should  you go it alone?  The answer really depends upon your circumstances and expertise.   Some businesses are so complex that a tax consultant should be retained  regardless how tax savvy the owner may be.  Other businesses are simple enough  that the owner should be able to handle the taxes without help -- provided that  the owner has invested the time to become tax savvy and has the appropriate  software.  In our opinion, no owner should be tax naive.  If you are, you will  make many mistakes that will cost  you money.
<p>
It is important to understand the differences between a tax consultant  and a tax preparer.  A tax preparer or paid preparer is one whom you pay  to prepare your tax returns, a clerical task.  They are a flesh and blood version  of tax preparation software like MacInTax.  A tax consultant, on the other  hand, will advise you on tax strategies for your business, assets or investments.   A tax consultant is usually a CPA or attorney who specializes in tax law.   Frequently, a tax consultant  is also willing to act as your tax preparer, filling out your tax returns for you.
<p>
Many  small businesses can get along just fine without a tax preparer.  In  fact, using tax preparation software instead of a paid preparer is probably a  good idea as it keeps the owner in touch with their taxes.  The question of whether  to substitute one of the many tax guides available each year for a tax consultant  is more difficult.  Ideally, the owner should know enough about tax law that they do not need a tax consultant -- for this is the best way they can make tax savvy decisions every day  of the year.  On the other hand, that is an ideal that is difficult to achieve  due to the complexity of our tax laws.  It is foolish not to retain a professional  if the professional can save you money.
<p>
Perhaps the best solution for  the small business owner is a combination of tax preparation software, tax guides,  and advice from a tax consultant.  What you want to do is transform your  tax consultant into a tax mentor.   You do this by learning as much as you can about taxes, meeting with a tax  consultant to review your situation, preparing your own returns, and meeting again  with your tax consultant to review your preparation of your returns.  This  keeps you involved in the process, so you continue to learn.  You are minimizing  the consultant's fee because you are taking less of their time.  And you still  have the benefit of a professional tax advisor.

<br>

MacInTax  by ChipSoft is one of our Technology Choice Award winners  with the designation "Best in its Class".  We highly recommend this  software.  It has features for both novices and experts alike and, although  a bit cumbersome at times, it is relatively easy to use and master.  ChipSoft  also offers state packages for the states of:  CA, CT, DC, IL, MA, MD, MI, MN,  NC, NJ, NY, OH, OR, PA, &amp; VA.
<p>
We  have used MacInTax for several years and it just keeps getting better.   This year we saw a huge improvement in the integration of the state packages  into the federal forms.  It is now practical to develop your state forms concurrently  with your federal, however it is still advisable to concentrate on your  federal forms first.
<p>
To complete your tax return using MacInTax, you work on  your screen with a form which looks just like the paper forms the IRS prints.   If you used MacInTax the previous  year, appropriate information is carried forward, thereby reducing your data  entry and possible mistakes.  You enter appropriate information for the current  year on a variety of forms that simplify the entire process.  For example, you  bring up a W-2 form in MacInTax which looks just like the W-2 you received from  your employer.  Any information printed on your W-2 is entered into the corresponding  box on the MacInTax W-2 form.  If you are filing a joint return, or  you or your spouse worked at more  than one job in the tax year, you bring up a separate W-2 form for each paper  form you have (i.e. one for each employer).  MacInTax will automatically total  the information you have entered from all your W-2 forms and automatically enter  it into the appropriate lines of your tax forms.  If you changed states during  the year, MacInTax will even keep track of how much tax was withheld in each  state.  MacInTax handles information from 1099 and other forms in a similar fashion.
<p>
MacInTax  allows you  to create an itemization for any line on your tax form.  This is a powerful feature  for several reasons.  First, it makes it easier to enter information since  each itemization is automatically summed and entered into your tax form.  Secondly,  it creates a record of exactly how that number was determined, which could  prove useful years later in an audit.
<p>
There are many other features of MacInTax,  such as a W-4 exemption form calculator that allows you to figure out how  many exemptions to claim to arrive  at a specific refund or tax owed total by the end of the year.  This is particularly  useful if you haven't been employed for the entire year or if your  salary has changed.  Following the IRS's instructions on the W-4 form only works  if are employed the entire year and your salary doesn't change, otherwise their  calculations will be wrong and you are likely to over withhold.  (Remember,  the IRS doesn't pay interest if you over withheld.)
<p>
Tax time is never fun, but  MacInTax makes it much more  bearable.  If you use a tax preparer to prepare your tax returns, you'll probably  benefit from MacInTax.  The software may cost you about the same as your paid  preparer, but you'll have a much better understanding of your taxes and it won't  really be any more work.  You'll also likely end up with a lower tax bill because  you have a personal incentive to ferret out those deductions.  MacInTax  won't replace a tax consultant or advisor if you need one, but all many people  need is MacInTax combined with  one or two of the tax preparation guides that invariably appear each tax season  -- all of which is tax deductible.
<p>
MacInTax, don't face April without it.

<br>
<strong>by Michael Kisor</strong> - May, 1991<br><br>
<font size=+3>T</font>elecommuting.   It has been prophesied as the great  work at home revolution of the 1990's.  A revolution which will mean the demise  of the "office" as we know it.  Its proponents tell us that it will increase  employee productivity and morale while reducing corporate operating expenses.   Its opponents warn us that telecommuters are workers whose homes are in jeopardy  of becoming the "electronic sweat shops" of the twenty first century.  The  truth, more likely, lies between  these two extremes.
<p>
The term "telecommuting," coined by Dr. Jack Nilles of  UCLA in 1973, refers to doing all or part of one's job at home; a job which would  <CITE>traditionally</CITE> be done in a central office location.  Outside salespeople,  field technicians and the like, who normally perform their jobs away  from the office, are not telecommuters.
<p>
While telecommuting is still in its  infancy, it is well beyond a theoretical idea.  Nilles, now president of JALA  Associates, a Los Angeles based  management consulting firm, estimates that over 1 million people telecommute  at least part time and that that number will swell to 4 or 5 million by the mid  1990's.  Others have placed the figure much higher.  LINK Resources Corp., a New  York consulting firm in emerging technologies, places it at 15.4 million people  telecommuting in 1988, 4.9 million of them with formal arrangements.  Companies  and governmental agencies all over the United States and Europe are implementing  pilot programs.  Virtually  all go on to institute permanent programs after their pilots.  In researching  this paper, only two failures were noted, contrasted with seventy successes.   The National Association for the Cottage Industry in 1989 estimated that over  500 US companies had successful telecommuting programs in place.
<p>
So successful  are some of these programs that companies sometimes consider the program and  its specifics to be confidential.  Nilles has noted the secrecy:  "They don't  want to tell their competitors  how to do better."  Lynne McGee, in her article <CITE>Setting up Work at Home</CITE>,  writes:  "Perhaps the most telling indication of the value of home work  programs is that many companies interviewed for this article declined to discuss  their programs.  Said one employment supervisor in the Midwest, 'In this tight  job market, we don't want to reveal what we view as trade secrets.'"
<p>
<font size=+3>W</font>hat  are the benefits of telecommuting?  The answer to that depends upon whom you ask.   For the employee, it is usually  something like eliminating the stress of commuting each day to the office,  a more flexible work schedule, fewer work interruptions, a more relaxing and comfortable  work environment, the ability to work when one is most productive, greater  job satisfaction, and the ability to continue working for an employer when  circumstances change.  For the employer, it is such things as increased employee  retention, expanded recruiting opportunities, increased employee productivity,  less absenteeism, better management  practices and organizational efficiency, reduced office space and expenses.
<p>
Often,  telecommuting programs begin as a response to unusual circumstances  or an attempt to retain a valued employee.  Donna Cunningham, Media-Relations  Manager  of AT&amp;T's Bell Labs in Short Hills, NJ, became a telecommuter  after she married and informed her supervisor that she planned to quit and move  to Vermont with her husband [ref: 1].  Pacific Bell, which employs more than 1,500 telecommuters  today, began its program  during the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games in response to the increased traffic  congestion caused by increased tourism [ref: 2].  Megatek began its telecommuting  program when it learned that five of their programmers expected babies near the  completion date of one of their software products [ref: 3].
<p>
Regardless of their motivation  for implementing pilot telecommuting programs, few companies would continue  them if there were no sound business reasons for doing so.  "If you select  and train your people properly,"  advises Nilles, "productivity will go up, morale will increase, and your turnover  rate will go down, sometimes drastically." All companies with successful  programs report increased productivity from their telecommuters.  The most common  figure cited is between 20 and 30 percent.  Carol D'Agostino, senior research  associate for LINK, says that "a 5 percent increase is low - and probably means  the program is not well run.  The typical increase in productivity would be  50 percent.  People who volunteer  are usually self-motivated achievers who find the distractions of the office  block their ability to work."  Nilles observes that "even the most hard-nosed,  skeptical managers say, 'At least productivity hasn't gone down.'"
<p>
The Travelers  Insurance Company says that their telecommuters are 20 percent more productive,  when comparing lines of code generated by their programming staff [ref: 4].  Buck  Benham, Special Assignments Manager of US West Inc., says:  "We have found that  the quantifiable benefits during  the two years that we kept very careful records ranged from absolutely no  increase in productivity to as much as a 30 to 40 percent increase.  Our [home-based  workers] said fewer interruptions, a quieter environment and reduced stress  enabled them to complete assignments more quickly and with better quality."   The Travelers' Michael Crampton, a director within the long range planning and  public policy unit and a telecommuter, agrees:  "I go up to my study, close the  door, and really focus and concentrate  on thinking activities.  If I have reading or research that I have to  do, I can really focus on it, and I find I am significantly more productive in  that environment."  Lack of the distractions normally found in the office is  the most frequently cited reason for the productivity boost.  "Somebody pops in  to talk to you or the phone rings.  Your mind shifts.  The question is," asks  Nilles, "How long does it take to get back to where you were?  Typically, the answer  I get varies from '15 minutes'  to 'I never get back.'"
<p>
Increased productivity isn't the only benefit.   Benham says that "some of our supervisors report that the telecommuters they  work with see an increase in their creative ability.  And we attribute that in  no small measure to their ability to concentrate or focus on the job to be done."   Alex Malcolm, Director of Strategic Systems at John Hancock, also believes  that creativity can be enhanced by telecommuting:  "The people with whom I work  are a creative type.  They don't  start thinking at 8:30 in the morning, nor do they stop thinking at 4:30 in  the afternoon.  Some of their best work probably is done in the wee hours of the  morning or late at night."  Drew Robichau, Senior Systems Analyst, agrees:  "Telecommuting  has given me the ability to really delve into the software much deeper  than I could have at the office.  It's given me a lot more time to 'play'  around, experiment and master some programs.  The day-to-day production pace of  the office is to get the job  done.  At home, I have the opportunity to pursue esoteric details.  It's been quite  an advantage."
<p>
Increased productivity, however, usually isn't the reason  that most companies implement a telecommuting program.  "Ten or twelve years  ago," Nilles says, "I thought that productivity increases would be the major incentive  for work-at-home programs.  But as it turns out, more often than not, it  isn't number one."  The two most common reasons are that "companies are running  out of office space or they  want to attract and retain some specially talented people."
<p>
Offering telecommuting  as a work option can greatly enhance a company's ability to recruit and  retain skilled people.  Alan Hunter, Assistant Executive Officer of the California  Franchise Tax Board, observes that with the last of the baby boomers now leaving  college, "everyone knows the labor market in the '90s for certain skills  is going to be treacherous."  Recruitment costs will continue to skyrocket as it  becomes more difficult to find  qualified candidates.  Travelers' Director of Human Resources, Diane Bengston,  says:   "Recruitment was a prime reason for offering work-at-home [arrangements]  to employees."  Telecommuting is not only attractive to prospective employees,  but it also expands the geographic area from which companies are able to recruit.   US West considers their telecommuting program to be an effective weapon  against the attrition of people with valuable skill sets as well as an valuable  recruitment tool.  "The fact  that we have telecommuting does make us highly attractive to prospective employees,"  say Benham.  "We also have cases of people who were going to leave the organization  but were able to stay [through] telecommuting."
<p>
<font size=+3>T</font>o realize the potential  that telecommuting offers, the program must be properly implemented.  That  includes good planning and good management.  Good planning is largely logistical  in nature:  assessing equipment needs, installation and maintenance, office  supplies and the like.  Good  management of telecommuters, on the other hand, often requires a change in style.   Many managers believe that you can't manage it if you can't see it.  That's  simply not true.  "The trick is to shift from observing activity to managing  results," says Jonathan Goodrich, a professor of marketing  in the College of Business  Administration, Florida International University, Miami.  Gil Gordon of  Gil Gordon and Associates, a New Jersey consulting firm specializing in telecommuting,  agrees.  When his firm  prepares managers for telecommuting, they focus on the difference "between observing  activity and managing for results.  There are some managers who, for whatever  reason, are used to, or like, or believe in that over-the-shoulder supervision.   I happen to think, though, that that kind of management is rapidly becoming  passe."  Joseph McKenna agrees:  "The manager needs to learn - or possibly  relearn - the essence of good management is <CITE>not</CITE> synonymous with standing  over an employee's shoulder."
<p>
Nilles  says that the initial reaction most managers have to telecommuting  is "how do we know if people are working if we can't see them?  The obvious  retort to that is 'How do you know they're working if you <CITE>can</CITE> see  them?'"  He adds "Managers have to learn how to manage, to find out what their  people are doing, set goals and objectives, and evaluate them on the basis of  what they produce, not if they look busy, or pretty, or ugly."  David Fleming  of the California Department of  General Services found that many of his managers "had no performance criteria  to begin with.  Not just for telecommuters, but for all employees."  Gordon adds  that telecommuting is "a way of enforcing good management practices.  It requires  managers to focus on the results, the deliverables, instead of the activity."
<p>
"You  develop some bad habits when your staff is clustered about you." says  Control Data Corporation's Ralph McCraw.  "You don't have to be as concise or  consistent in the way you inform  workers [because you know those] who don't understand a task can yell across  the hall:  'Hey, what's this all about?'"  Nilles adds that those who succeed  at managing telecommuters increase their level of overall managerial expertise [ref: 5].   He further observes that "the major obstacle to telecommuting in the last 15  years has been conservative management with industrial revolution mind-sets." [ref: 6]
<p>
Franklin  Reece, III, president of USTeleCenters in Boston says that "I do  a lot of management by wandering  around.  I just do it by wandering through remote telecommunications.  I think  that I am still a pat-on-the-back coach."  USTeleCenters has about 100 employees,  most of whom telecommute a minimum of two days a week.
<p>
On the flip side,  James Barry, Vice President and Publisher of International Custom Publishing,  is a manager who is himself a telecommuter.  He finds that an unexpected benefit  of his telecommuting is that he is able to judge his own staff more objectively.   He says that "the arrangement  puts a premium on clarity of purpose and direction.  You're judging people  on whether they got the job done and the quality of their work."
<p>
Barry is not  the only manager who telecommutes.  Tom Peters (author of <CITE>In Search of  Excellence </CITE>and<CITE> Thriving on Chaos</CITE>) manages a Palo Alto headquartered  business from Vermont eight months a year.  He thinks that telecommuting  is "the ultimate bureaucracy-bashing tool."
<p>
<font size=+3>T</font>hough failures are rare, some  programs do not realize their  fullest potential either.  Two failed programs were found in the research of  this paper:  The Hartford and California-Western States Life.
<p>
The Hartford's  pilot program, not viewed as a success, was discontinued.  There were, however,  a number of factors which contributed to their failure.  Raymond Howell was Assistant  Vice-President of Information Management at the time.  He said that senior  management was not supportive of program and the political climate was not  favorable.  In addition, there  were technical problems.
<p>
The company chose not to install state of the art  workstations or telecommunications equipment.  They also had difficulties connecting  the telecommuters with their mainframe (during a time when the local telephone  company was on strike).  To make matters worse, the telecommuters had little  technical support from their MIS department.  Two months before their pilot  was terminated, upgraded workstations were installed and the 600 BAUD modems were  replaced by 1200 BAUD modems.   The results were encouraging [ref: 7].
<p>
The telecommuters in The Hartford's program  were enthusiastic, says Howell.  They thought that they were "in an almost ideal  situation where they could work during their peak hours, and plan home responsibilities  around their jobs.  They thought it was a very positive experience,  and their managers would support that statement."
<p>
Cal-West's experience was  much less positive, ultimately resulting in a $250,000 lawsuit for economic  losses and "not less than $1 million"  in punitive damages.  The suit was eventually settled out of court for an  undisclosed amount.  Cal-West's 1982 telecommuting program, a textbook case of  what not to do, attempted to save the company money by converting full time employees  into independent contractors.  The company offered "telecommuting" only  to those who agreed to give up their benefits and work on a pay-by-the-piece  basis.  They could set their own hours, but they had to meet certain weekly quotas.   The quotas allegedly became  excessive and the lawsuit followed.
<p>
Cal-West's program violated a policy  advocated by most telecommuting experts:  leave compensation and benefits untouched [ref: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].  The Travelers' Crampton said:  "We wanted to ensure that the  telecommuter was treated just like any other employee of the Travelers.  There  could be no distinction in terms of benefits, salary or career paths.  The telecommuter  has to be on an equal footing."
<p>
Programs such as Cal-West's have  caused some to assert that telecommuting  could lead to in--home electronic sweat shops.  The AFL-CIO, for example,  asked the United States Department of Labor in 1983 to ban telecommuting [ref: 15, 16].   It seems unlikely that that will happen in the next few years, however, as President  Bush praised the telecommuting concept when he addressed the California  Chamber of Commerce in March of 1990 [ref: 17, 18].
<p>
<font size=+3>W</font>hat's involved in a successful  telecommuting program?  Good management and good planning, and a little pioneering  spirit.  Don't be afraid to  try telecommuting, says Pacific Bell's Al Repato.  "The bottom line has always  been a positive gain as far as the company is concerned."
<p>
Good management will  focus on objectives.  The Travelers' uses the same objective-oriented management  and appraisal system for telecommuters as they do for other employees.  Telecommuters,  says Travelers' Crampton, "negotiate their objectives and establish  their performance standards with their respective managers, and they are measured  based upon that."
<p>
Good  planning consists of anticipating the needs of the home office, installation of  equipment, and connectivity.  Usually, one or two dedicated business telephone  lines, paid for by the employer [ref: 19], should be set up.  Good planning also involves  selecting the right people, determining the methods and kinds of communication,  and the frequency.  Gordon recommends candidates with at least six months  experience:  "We want somebody who's been on the job long enough to answer many  of their own questions and solve  many of their own problems."  He also cautions:  "It is not for everyone, and  the manager has to retain that same discretion as he or she would for any other  assignment."  Another important consideration to plan for is that there is a  predictable period of adjustment (and decreased productivity) when an individual  begins to telecommute.  This often takes from one to three months and is usually  directly proportional to the amount time required to procure and train on  all the needed equipment.
<p>
"Despite  its appeal from a technology standpoint, telecommuting is really a business  solution to business problems," says Gordon.  "Both the employer and the employee  can come out ahead in such a situation, something we don't have an opportunity  to see happen very often."

<B>By Marie d'Amico</B>
<p>
With the advent of digital technology, replicating and using copyrighted work has become teenager's play. Although widespread, it's also a violation of federal copyright law.
<p>
There is, however, an important exception: fair use. Whether companies and individuals can legally copy and use all or part of a copyrighted work is based on the following criteria: whether the material is for commercial or nonprofit use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount of the work used, and the effect upon the original work's market. As Kerry Konrad, a senior attorney for Cambridge, Massachusetts based Lotus Development Corp., said, "If your use is private, limited, and for the purpose of reference and illustration only, it's likely to be fair."
<p>
The American Society of Composers, Authors & Publishers, for example, said it is fair use if a company uses a copyrighted song in a multimedia presentation in-house and doesn't charge admission.
<p>
But Jay Monahan, director of Domestic & International Anti-Piracy with Walt Disney Television in Burbank, California, said: "Where a valuable intellectual property is involved, such as a well known song or animated character, use of even a few bars or a single picture could easily exceed the bounds of fair use."
<p>
Users can also request permission from the owner of a copyright, but they should be prepared for rejection even if the use is fair. When Michael Tchao was an Apple product marketing manager, he wanted to use a Star Trek postcard for an Apple party announcement. The company contacted Star Trek's owner, Paramount Pictures, which said Apple needed William Shatner's permission, even though the party was private and free. Shatner said OK.
<p>
MCA Inc. refused to license, even for payment, a one-second sample of the Beatles classic song "Get Back" for use in a developer's About Box; MCA gave no reason for the rejection.
<p>
Greg Christie, a Newton developer, discovered that some companies, such as General Magic Inc., don't have the Supreme Court justices' sense of humor. He designed a bit-mapped, nonworking screen gag of Magic Cap for Apple's Newton on a "whim" and placed it free on CompuServe. General Magic's lawyers sent him a cease and desist letter and, rather than fight, he pulled the product.
<p>
An on-line version of the fair use statute, 17 U.S.C. Section 107, is available at: <img src="../../graphics/alerts/externLink.gif" align=left vspace=5 hspace=30 border=0 alt="External Link Warning: "><A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc/17/overview.html"><p>http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc/17/overview.html</A>.

<br> <br>
<center> <h3> Column Notes:  </h3> </center>

The "IC" column details the ISP's connection to the InterNet.  This is an important factor in determining how responsive web browsing and downloading will be.  Also important is the number of other simultaneous users, and the number of gateways to the InterNet backbone, etc.  It is similar to a municipal water supply. Water pressure depends upon the size of the water main and the number of houses with their taps turned on at any given time.    Generally speaking, multiple connections are better.  Currently, T1 is the most common unit of measure.  "&lt;T1" means less than a full T1 connection.  "T1" means a single T1 connection.  Multiple connections are in this format:  n-T1, where n is a multipler.  "3-T1", therefore, means three T1 lines connect  that ISP to the InterNet.  A T3 line is roughly equivalent to three T1 lines.
<p>
BAUD rate is the the fastest speed at which you can dial into the ISP, excluding ISDN (which is not listed on this chart).
<p>
Monthly charges vary greatly.  Some ISP's offer different levels of service.   Higher prices do not necessarily reflect better quality or more features.  The chart reflects the LOWEST monthly rate for a PPP connection, and other service options may be available for higher prices.  This may or may not include shell access, web page hosting, etc.

<b>PETsMART, Inc.</b> the original, and largest, pet superstore chain, is the industry leader in the pet food and supply business.  Its investment profile is very strong.  PETsMART is dedicated to the care and well-being of animals, reflected by its community involvement and investment. 

This commitment is confirmed by its mission and values and its Customer Bill of Rights.  PETsMART also provides many career opportunities around the nation.<p>

Each of its 18,000-30,000 square foot stores carry a variety of merchandise (brand name and premium pet foods, vitamins, toys and supplies) for a host of pets (dogs, cats, birds, fish, rabbits, hamsters, reptiles, horses and other domestic animals).  A selection of over 12,000 pet food and supply items are available at each PETsMART store.  In addition, a number of services are provided at many locations such as grooming, obedience classes and vaccination clinics. 

<p>

PETsMART seeks to serve all caring and value-oriented pet owners. It is dedicated to the care and well-being of all animals.  Rather than selling dogs and cats in its stores, PETsMART donates prime store space to local pet adoption programs. Customer education is given high priority through a variety of information resources.  PETsMART is highly involved in the communities it serves through a number of programs.

<p>

As of January 1996, PETsMART has over 263 stores <A HREF="../shop/locator.htm">locations</A> in 31 states.  These stores employ over 9,000 associates; between 30 and 35 individuals at each location.

In addition to quality pet food, a large variety of supplies and fantastic prices, PETsMART provides fun and useful information.  Customers can

actually take their pets shopping with them, watch the entire grooming process through huge windows, pick up tips from in-store obedience classes,

find over 500 varieties of freshwater tropical fish, enjoy the activities of birds in free-flight aviaries, or learn through interactive video in a

<A HREF="http://www.discovery.com/">Discovery Channel</A> Center.

<p>

A Discovery Channel Center is a 600 square foot "store-within-a-store" dedicated to learning about the environment and its inhabitants.  Knowledge of

these animals teaches us more about our pets and responsible ownership.  That's why PETsMART teamed up with The Discovery Channel to create these

centers.  Discovery Channel Centers combine educational products, an interactive computer system, and all sorts of wild things to create a truly

unique experience for customers of all ages.

<p>

In addition to the Discovery Channel Centers, PETsMART has a wide variety of informational literature on animals and pet care, as well as a <A

HREF="../news/articles.htm">news</A> magazine.

The pet product and services market is big business.  It has grown into a $15 billion industry, largely due to the fact that more than half of all U.S. households (53 million) share their homes with pets.  American families provide homes for 59 million cats, 54 million dogs and 88 million fish.  These families spent nearly $194 million for dog food and $94.3 million for cat food in 1993 alone.  A decade ago, nearly 95 percent of pet food was sold in grocery stores - compared to only 60 percent today.  Premium pet food sales have grown from 15 percent of annual food sales five years ago to 23 percent today.  Dog owners are also invested in fashion, spending $136 million on clothing, accessories, collars and leashes in 1993.  Happily, 62 percent of dog owners, 59 percent of cat owners and 40 percent of bird owners make sure that their pets receive veterinary care for vaccinations and annual exams.

<p>

PETsMART is one of America's fastest growing companies according to <a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/@@G78yL4CYgQIAQA4h/fortune/">Fortune Magazine</a> (August 1994).  Its sales-per-square-foot are the highest in the industry, and its total revenue is currently in the billion dollar range.  Its remarkable growth rate has created a pet supply retailer four to five times larger than any like competition in the nation.  Also, PETsMART is the only superstore with all locations totaling over 18,000 square feet.

<p>

PETsMART, unlike other pet supply retailers, is designed to attract customers not only from within the pet specialty arena, but also from discount stores, warehouse clubs and grocery stores.  Due to this broad base of appeal, PETsMART works on higher volume rates than other pet supply retailers and is able to target all caring, value-oriented pet owners as customers.

<p>A recent earnings statement is available in the <a href=../news/pr.htm>Press Release</a> page.

At PETsMART, pets are considered a part of the family.  But not all animals are so lucky.  Every year <b>seventeen million animals are euthanized</b> in the United States because there simply are not enough resources to care for them.  The problem is two-fold: in 1993 alone, nearly 60,000 healthy but homeless dogs and cats were euthanized in Maricopa County (which encompasses the greater metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona).  The cost to taxpayers is estimated at <b>$2.4 million</b>.

<p>

The largest contributing factors to homeless animals are the failure of pet owners to <b>spay or neuter</b> their animals and <b>obedience</b> problems.  <b>Abandonment</b> and placement in shelters ultimately lead to euthanasia for most of these animals.

<p>

PETsMART Charities (a 501 (c) (3) non-profit, charitable organization) is committed to ending this problem.  Through its <a href=luvapet.htm><b>Luv A Pet Solution</b></a>, homeless animals are given a chance to be a part of someone's family through grants given to targeted programs.   Luv A Pet Solution is operated by <b>Animal Foundation International</b> (a Las Vegas, Nevada-based organization), and is funded by PETsMART <i>Charities</i>.  The program is initially serving Maricopa County.

Project Pet is an exciting opportunity for animal rescue organizations to partner with PETsMART for fundraising.  Approved organizations are assigned three consecutive Project Pet PETsMART shopping days.  They receive a flyer template and a sheet of certificates customized with their organization name and shopping dates.  The flyers and certificates can then be duplicated and distributed - anywhere but at a PETsMART location.

<p>

Certificates recipients who shop at PETsMART during the designated shopping days can feel proud, knowing that five percent of their purchases will be donated to the sponsoring animal rescue organization.  Organizations nationwide have earned as much as $400 through Project Pet.

<p>

Animal rescue organizations are invited to submit a one-page application and $5 fee to PETsMART for consideration.  For information call (602) 944-7070.

Luv A Pet Solution has <b>four major components</b> that reach the root causes of overpopulation and needless euthanasia.

<p>



<b>Aggressive Adoption Strategies</b><br>



	Permanent, fully operational adoption facilities are built in many PETsMART locations and are donated to local animal shelter and rescue organizations.  Many organizations lack the volunteers to fully utilize these <b>Luv A Pet Adoption Centers</b>, but PETsMART <i>Charities</i> is providing <b>leadership and funding</b> to develop a comprehensive program enabling a <b>seven-day-a-week adoption program</b>, beginning in Phoenix.  Working with County shelters and non-profit agencies, this program is key to increasing <b>responsible pet adoptions</b>.  

<p>

<b>Aggressive Spay and Neuter Programs</b><br>



	In December 1994, PETsMART Charities launched "Spay/Neuter 2000" to make these services more accessible and affordable through the establishment of a Luv A Pet Spay/Neuter Clinic and two similar clinics adjacent to Maricopa County's Animal Control Facilities.  This program will sterilize all adopted pets from Rabies/Animal Control before they go to their new homes.  On February 14, 1995 PETsMART helped the Luv A Pet Spay/Neuter clinic open its doors in Phoenix, Arizona.  This high-volume, low-cost clinic is operated by the Animal Foundation International.  The goal is to make these programs available in all PETsMART communities by the year 2000.

<p>

<b>Consumer Education</b><br>



	Education and responsible pet ownership go hand in hand.  Knowledge about the needs of animals, immunizations, spaying and neutering, proper care, nutrition and training is important for any owner who wants a healthy, well-behaved addition to the family.  PETsMART partners with a variety of community leaders in public education efforts about responsible pet ownership.

<p>

	PETsMART also provides a wide range of information at the store through printed materials (both posted signs and printed take-home information) with messages about proper pet behavior, environmental needs, health and nutrition and PETsMART policies.  Another in-store example are the <a href="http://www.discovery.com">Discovery Channel</a> Centers; a store-within-a-store.  These centers combine educational products, an interactive computer system and printed information to create a truly unique experience for customers of all ages.

<p>

<b>Obedience Training Programs</b><br>



	PETsMART has a very basic belief about dog obedience-obedient dogs are a pleasure to have around, and disobedient dogs too often end up abused or in shelters because the owners could not control them.  Most of these animals are eventually euthanized.  PETsMART believes that one of the best things a responsible dog-owner can do is get training for themselves and their dogs.   So, PETsMART Charities encourages all new pet owners to enroll in a pet obedience class to learn the most effective ways to train new animals and PETsMART put a lot of time and research into designing a top-notch training program for its two- and four-legged customers.  Every PETsMART store offers obedience training on the premises, and a free introductory class is offered to customers who adopt a pet through the Luv A Pet Adoption centers.

<p>

	The obedience instructors don't train the dogs, they train the owners in how to train their dogs.  The methods taught are very positive and emphasize a humane, gentle approach to dog obedience.  Only positive reinforcement is used in the classes, and the techniques learned help to build a positive relationship between the owner and the pet in a home setting.  Classes are held in all locations on weekdays, weeknights and weekends to fit anyone's schedule.  Class sizes are limited to twelve students so that high quality can be maintained while allowing a lot of one-on-one attention.  Two different programs are offered one for the initial socialization and training of puppies three to six months of age, and one for adult dogs six months or older for basic commands and control techniques. Please contact a <a href="../shop/locator.htm">location</a> near you for more information.

<p>

Anyone can help PETsMART Charities fulfill its mission of ending pet overpopulation and needless euthanasia in the United States by making tax-deductible contributions as allowed by law.  Grants are made only to appropriate non-profit organizations and governmental agencies.  Unlike many other charitable organizations, PETsMART Charities commits 100% of its charitable contributions to its mission.

<h2 align="CENTER">PETsMART&#174; presents Three Dog Bakery&#174; gourmet
treats and new cookbook for canines</h2>

<CENTER><strong>Dogs Celebrate Holidays in Epicurean Style at PETsMART
</strong></CENTER>

<P>

PHOENIX (November 1, 1996) -- Tis' the season to be jolly -- and
dogs across the nation are howling for Three Dog Bakery treats
now available at PETsMART, Inc. From Whole Kitten Caboodles and
Jump 'n Sit Bits to the newly-released cookbook &quot;Short Tails
and Treats From Three Dog Bakery,&quot; canines all over can experience
the edible joys of the holiday season.
<P>
Kansas City-based Three Dog Bakery, a fully operable bakery for
dogs, creates wholesome, fresh-baked, all-natural treats in a
variety of dog-loving flavors, shapes and sizes. Four of the bakeries
are located inside PETsMART superstores in San Diego County. A
selection of specially packaged treats are available on-shelf
at most PETsMART superstores. Featured bakery items include Ciao Wow
Pizzas, Slab O' Ribs and Scotty Biscottis.
<P>
New for the season.... the Three Dog Bakery cookbook, &quot;Short
Tails and Treats From Three Dog Bakery,&quot; is now available
-- complete with 19 muzzle-watering recipes for homemade doggie
delights. Dogs can also have their &quot;howli-day&quot; treats
delivered to them at home through the Three Dog Bakery Dogalog&#174;
featuring 120 mail-order selections for both humans and canines
alike.
<P>
&quot;Dogs everywhere can experience holiday cheer with our healthy,
homemade treats that their owners can also feel good about,&quot;
says Mark Beckoff, founder of Three Dog Bakery. &quot;We, like
PETsMART, know that pets are part of the family, which is why
PETsMART and Three Dog Bakery are such natural partners.&quot;
<P>
Three Dog Bakery has pampered the palates of man's and woman's
best friends for more than six years. A bare bones beginning with
a 59-cent biscuit cutter was enhanced by a strong commitment and
deep determination to make healthy baked goods for dogs. That
healthy combination is the reason Three Dog Bakery has skyrocketed
into more than a $1 million company with five percent of annual
profits given to organizations that help abused and neglected
dogs.
<P>
&quot;What sets our superstores apart from others across America
is the store-within-a-store concept, enabling us to offer our
customers convenient, one-stop shopping during the holidays and
all year round,&quot; says Dennis Woods, PETsMART public relations
coordinator. &quot;Three Dog Bakery takes our pet appeal one step
further.&quot; 
<P>

the PETsMART Internet site at <a href="/">http://www.petsmart.com/</a>.

<h2 align="CENTER">PETsMART&#174; Santa Claws&#174; Photos Give Families
a Keepsake and Homeless Animals a Chance</h2>

<P>
<CENTER><strong>Pets Pose For Photos; Pet Charities Receive Profits
</strong></center>

<P>
PHOENIX (November 1, 1996) -- PETsMART, Inc. expresses the true
spirit of holiday giving by providing pets and their families
the opportunity to create memorable holiday photos with all profits
given to pet charities. PETsMART expects its annual Santa Claws
Photos to raise more than $250,000 for animal welfare organizations
nationwide this holiday season. 
<P>
PETsMART, the world's largest pet superstore and originator of
Santa Claws Photos, has raised more than $1 million for animal
welfare organizations since it began the promotion during the
1988 holiday season. More than 135,000 pets and their families
were photographed at PETsMART superstores last year.
<P>
Pets of all kinds including cats, dogs, goats, iguanas, llamas
and even baby tigers have been known to pose with Santa Claws
along with other family members. One-hundred percent of petsmart's
profits from each pet photo are donated to local animal welfare
organizations through petsmart Charities&#174; -- a non-profit
organization created by petsmart to provide financial support
to projects that help combat pet overpopulation.
<P>
&quot;The Santa Claws Photo program emphasizes PETsMART's philosophy
-- that pets are an important part of our family,&quot; says Carol
Hixson, PETsMART's director of promotions. &quot;People all across
the country enjoy having their family pet appear in their holiday
portraits. Many now make it a family tradition, and it's all for
a good cause.&quot; 
<P>
Photo sessions are held on weekends at most PETsMART superstores
beginning Thanksgiving weekend and continuing through Sunday,
Dec. 15. Santa is scheduled to appear from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on
Saturdays and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays. Check local PETsMART
stores for details <a href="#footnote">*</a>.
<P>
&quot;Volunteers from local animal welfare organizations help
out in the studio, often playing the role of Santa himself,&quot;
says Jessica Thomas, PETsMART community relations manager. &quot;This
gives volunteers the opportunity to make Santa Claws Photos their
own fundraising campaign.&quot;
<P>
PETsMART is the industry leader in the pet food and supply business
with 1995 sales exceeding $1 billion. PETsMART currently operates
more than 300 superstores in 33 states and Canada. The company
is publicly traded on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol
PETM.
<P>
For more information on PETsMART or PETsMART Charities call 1-800-738-1385
or visit the PETsMART Internet site at <a href="/">http://www.petsmart.com/</a>.

<P>
<a name="footnote">*</a> The dates and times for Santa Claws Photos vary
slightly by market. Please call a PETsMART superstore in your area to confirm
these details. For the closest store, call 1-800-785-0557, or check the <a

<p>

PETsMART&copy; Grooming Survey Reveals The Truth About Cats and Dogs

<p>

PHOENIX (August 15, 1996) --  Have you ever noticed how your favorite four-legged friend behaves after spending the afternoon at a grooming shop? 

<p>

A majority of pet owners (72 percent) feel their pets know that they are gorgeous after a grooming, according to an informal national pet owners survey conducted by <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> on the Internet.  Owners claim they detect this positive attitude from their pets in several ways.  Sixty-two percent said their pets strut around the house or yard after returning home with a new "do," while 30 percent find their pets rolling around in playful pleasure.

<p>

When performing pet groomings at home, owners find themselves in troubled waters, as almost half (46 percent) described their feelings by the statement "No, don't shake now, I'm not done yet!"   Another 33 percent of those surveyed get a bit frustrated at their over-active pets for jumping around too much. 

<p>

Since pet owners agree that proper animal care includes regular groomings, some choose to have their pets professionally groomed versus doing it themselves.  One respondent said, "It's just like changing the oil or washing your car yourself, it's good to see how a professional does it."  

<p>

When asked how often people pamper their pets, 70 percent of respondents were proud to claim they cater to their loved ones every day.  From taking their dogs and cats for car rides, to blow drying their bird (on a cool setting, of course) to giving their cat a facial, pet owners clearly do whatever it takes to keep their pets happy.

<p>

<a href="../../">PETsMART</a>, the nation's largest pet superstore chain, is the industry leader in the pet food and supply business with 1995 sales exceeding one billion dollars.  <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> currently operates over <a href="../shop/locator.htm">300 superstores in 33 states</a>.  The company is publicly traded on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol <a href="../petsmart/quote.htm">PETM</a>.

<p>


The PETsMART Dog Days of Summer Survey was conducted through the <a href="../../">PETsMART homepage</a>, located on the web at <a href="../../">http://www.PETsMART.com/</a>.

<h2 align="center"><font color="#ff1111">CAUTION</font>: Proper Pet Care is Necessary During the Dog Days of Summer</h2>

The hot weather of summer affects everyone, but most especially our four-legged friends.  As uncomfortable as humans are, imagine how that long-haired golden retriever feels when the temperature outside tops <font color="#ff0000">90 degrees</font> plus <font color="#2222bb">humidity</font>!

<p>

Because of its concern for pets, <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> is urging pet owners to take proper care of their animals during the "Dog Days of Summer" by having them <a href="../shop/grooming.htm">professionally groomed</a> every 4-6 weeks.

<p>

There are several reasons why it is particularly important to have pets groomed during the summer months, according to Maggie Thompson, director of <a href="../shop/grooming.htm">grooming services</A> at <a href="../../">PETsMART</a>.  "As the environment heats up, fleas and ticks become a serious problem for animals, and pets' skin becomes dry and itchy," said Thompson.  "Heavy winter fur can make the summer heat unbearable for pets, having them groomed removes a large portion of the undercoat of fur that has accumulated over the winter season and helps them stay <font color="#0000ff">cooler</font>," added Thompson.

<p>

Nail trimming and cleaning pets' ears and anal glands are aspects of grooming that many pet owners often overlook.  Nail trimming is important because untrimmed nails can cause physical pain in pets' paws and even lead to foot deformity.  When pets have dirty ears,  they may become itchy, smelly and uncomfortable.  

<p>

Thompson also notes that dogs that drag their rear ends across the carpet may need to have their anal glands cleaned.  This will not only stop the unsightly behavior, but the cleaning will also relieve the dog from the uncomfortable condition.

<p>

<a href="../../">PETsMART</a> has implemented a national certification program for all its store groomers.  "Because there is no national licensing for verifying a groomer's technical and safety qualifications, <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> has created an internal certification program to ensure consumers' that their pets will receive the safest possible grooming services at all <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> locations," said Thompson.	

<p>

A <a href="../shop/grooming.htm">full service grooming</a> at <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> includes ear cleaning, brushing, bathing, nail trimming, customized hair cut, cleaning of the anal glands and paw pad trimming.

<p>

For those pet owners who choose to groom their pets at home, <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> provides the following tips:

<ul>

<li> Always use a no-tear shampoo, especially on the head.  The wrong shampoo can be damaging to the pets' eyes.

<li> People shampoos are not pH-balanced for pets which can cause severe skin irritation for animals.  <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> recommends using a pet shampoo which is specifically  pH-balanced for animals.

<li> An excessive amount of water in pets' ears may lead to infections, so <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> groomers suggests placing cotton balls in your pets' ears while bathing them.  This will help prevent water from draining into their ears.

<li> Skin problems can easily arise in dogs with wrinkles (i.e. Pugs, Shar Peis), so owners should be sure that they are cleaning their dogs carefully in between the folds in their dogs' skin.

<li> Always be on the look-out if your pets are scratching a lot or have specks of dried blood on their skin -- these are signs that your pet may have fleas or ticks.

<li> Be sure to trim your pets nails properly.  Not trimming them or trimming them too short can cause pain and discomfort for your pet.

</ul>

<font size+1>PETsMART, INC. REPORTS RECORD QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL EARNINGS</font><p>



    PHOENIX, Feb. 20 /PRNewswire/ -- PETsMART, Inc., (Nasdaq: PETM)

today announced its unaudited financial results for its fourth quarter

and year ended January 28, 1996.  All results have been restated to

reflect the 1995 acquisitions of Petstuff, Inc., Sporting Dog

Specialties, Inc., and The Pet Food Giant, Inc.<p>

    Net sales for the quarter were $292.2 million, an increase of 14.7%

over the $254.7 million reported for the fourth quarter last year.

Comparable store sales for the quarter increased 8.9%, excluding the Pet

Food Giant stores, some of which were closed for retrofitting and

remerchandising during the quarter.  The Company opened 10 stores during

the quarter and closed 2, including 1 relocated store, and operated

262 stores in 32 states at the end of the quarter.<p>

    For the year ended January 28, 1996, the Company reported net sales

of $1.03 billion, an increase of 26.1% over the $817.6 million reported

for last year.  Comparable store sales for the year increased 12.5%,

excluding the Petstuff and Pet Food Giant stores, some of which were

closed for retrofitting and remerchandising during the year.<p>

    The Company's income tax provision for the fourth quarter reflects

the recognition of a $2.1 million tax benefit related to the Company's

utilization of the Pet Food Giant net operating loss carryforward.  The

Company's income tax provision for the year also reflects the

recognition of a $10.1 million tax benefit related to the Company's

utilization of the Petstuff net operating loss carryforward.  Excluding

these items, the Company's effective income tax rate from operations was

37% for the quarter and for the year.<p>

    The Company reported unaudited net income of $15.2 million (or $0.29

per share) for the fourth quarter as compared to a net loss of $330,000

(or $(0.01) per share) for the fourth quarter last year.  Net income for

the fourth quarter on a comparable basis, excluding merger and

nonrecurring charges and the aforementioned Pet Food Giant tax benefit,

increased from $3.2 million (or $0.07 per share) last year to

$13.1 million (or $0.25 per share) this year.<p>

    The Company reported an unaudited net loss of $2.8 million (or

$(0.06) per share) for the year January 28, 1996, as compared to a net

loss of $9.8 million (or $(0.20) per share) for last year.  For fiscal

1995, net income on a comparable basis, excluding merger and

nonrecurring charges and the related tax benefits and recognition of NOL

tax benefits, increased from income of $3.3 million (or $0.07 per share)

last year to $23.1 million (or $0.44 per share) this year.<p>

    Mark S. Hansen, President and Chief Executive Officer of PETsMART,

Inc., stated, "In spite of the impact of the January storms, we are

pleased to report record sales and earnings for our fourth quarter.  We

consider our overall performance in 1995 to be outstanding, considering

the level of acquisition and integration activity during the year.  We

believe the Company is well positioned for growth in 1996."<p>

    On January 31, 1996, PETsMART announced it had consummated its

acquisition of all of the outstanding equity securities of State Line

Tack, Inc.  State Line Tack, a New Hampshire based company,

is the leading world-wide catalog retailer specializing in discount

brand name tack, riding apparel and equine supplies.  At the closing of

the transaction, 600,000 shares of PETsMART Common Stock were issued for

all outstanding shares of State Line Tack, Inc.  The transaction, which

is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, will be accounted

for as a pooling of interests.  For its year ended December 31, 1995,

State Line Tack reported revenues of $53.8 million and a net loss of

$1.1 million.<p>

    PETsMART, Inc. is the leading operator of superstores specializing

in pet food, supplies and services in the United States.  PETsMART

currently operates 268 superstores in 32 states.<p>

    The Company's common stock trades on The Nasdaq Stock Market under

<font size=+1>PETsMART Offers LUV A PET Rebates For Pet Adoptions</font></center><P>

       PHOENIX (January 29, 1996) -- For a limited time, PETsMART is offering Luv A

Pet rebates to reward pet lovers who adopt rather than buy their next pet.  Anyone who

adopts a pet February 25 through March 16, may receive a Luv A Pet rebate for 25 percent

of their adoption fee, up to $15.  To receive a rebate the new owner must bring an adoption

receipt to one of more than 260 PETsMART locations nationwide before March 31.

PETsMART facilitates the adoption of thousands of homeless pets through its Luv A Pet

Adoption Centers located inside each PETsMART superstore.  The fully-operational space is

donated to local animal shelters and rescue groups as a highly visible place to present their

shelter animals for adoption.  Luv A Pet rebates are good for pets adopted from these

facilities as well as pets adopted from any other animal shelter.<p>

       "With these rebates, PETsMART is showing its appreciation for consumers who

choose to really 'Luv A Pet' and adopt a shelter animal," said Sara Stredney, community

relations manager for PETsMART.  "During the last Luv A Pet Rebate offer in October

1995, PETsMART handed out rebates for 9,700 adoptions totaling nearly $100,000."<p>

                               

       In addition to the cash rebate, customers will receive an 8-pound bag of dog food or a

4-pound bag of cat food, courtesy of Iams Pet Foods.  They will also receive an adoption kit

containing information on how to care for their new pet.<p>

       PETsMART has been a long time advocate for pet adoption and responsible pet

ownership.  Luv A Pet Adoption Centers are part of the Luv A Pet Solutions, a program

developed by PETsMART Charities which includes four major components: Aggressive

Adoption Strategies, Spay/Neuter Programs, Consumer Education and Obedience Training

Programs.  In addition to the Luv A Pet Adoption centers inside each PETsMART

superstore, PETsMART Charities donates money in the form of grants to a number of

organizations that reach the root causes of pet overpopulation.  Since 1987, the company has

donated more than $2.5 million to organizations and local animal shelters that meet their very

high standards.<p>

       PETsMART Charities, a non-profit organization, was created by PETsMART, Inc. --

the nation's largest pet superstore chain operating 263 stores in 32 states -- to provide

financial support for projects that help combat pet overpopulation, produce humane education

materials for the public and improve the quality of animal care.<p>

       For more information on PETsMART or <a href="../petsmart/charity.htm">PETsMART Charities</a>, to find the <a href=../shop/locator.htm>location</a>

nearest you or to receive a free PETsMART catalog, call 1-800-785-0557.

<b>PETsMART will not sell dogs or cats.</b> Instead, they facilitate the adoption of

               thousands of homeless pets by building permanent adoptions centers in all of their

               stores and donating the fully-operational space to local animal shelters and rescue

               groups. These facilities are called Luv A Pet adoption centers and provide everything

               programs need to find suitable homes for animals; including a concerned, animal-loving

               clientele. 

<p>

               PETsMART does sell tropical fish and birds. The stores carry only freshwater fish and

               birds that are domestically-raised, unendangered species that are housed in free-flight

               aviaries. PETsMART also carries a wide assortment of aquatic plants. <p>

               PETsMART has a very basic belief about dog obedience-obedient dogs are

               a pleasure to have around, and disobedient dogs too often end up abused or

               in shelters because the owners could not control them. Most of these animals

               are eventually euthanized. PETsMART believes that one of the best things a

               responsible dog-owner can do is get training for themselves and their dogs.

               So, PETsMART Charities encourages all new pet owners to enroll in a pet

               obedience class to learn the most effective ways to train new animals and

               PETsMART put a lot of time and research into designing a top-notch training

               program for its two- and four-legged customers. Every PETsMART store

               offers obedience training on the premises, and a free introductory class is

               offered to customers who adopt a pet through the Luv A Pet Adoption

               centers. 

<p>

               The obedience instructors don't train the dogs, they train the owners in how to

               train their dogs. The methods taught are very positive and emphasize a

               humane, gentle approach to dog obedience. Only positive reinforcement is

               used in the classes, and the techniques learned help to build a positive

               relationship between the owner and the pet in a home setting. Classes are

               held in all locations on weekdays, weeknights and weekends to fit anyone's

               schedule. Class sizes are limited to twelve students so that high quality can be

               maintained while allowing a lot of one-on-one attention. Two different

               programs are offered one for the initial socialization and training of puppies

               three to six months of age, and one for adult dogs six months or older for

               basic commands and control techniques. Please contact a <a href=locator.htm>location</a> near you

               for more information.

<h2 align="center"><font color="#ff1111">CAUTION</font>: Proper Pet Care is Necessary During the Dog Days of Summer</h2>

The hot weather of summer affects everyone, but most especially our four-legged friends.  As uncomfortable as humans are, imagine how that long-haired golden retriever feels when the temperature outside tops <font color="#ff0000">90 degrees</font> plus <font color="#2222bb">humidity</font>!

<p>

Because of its concern for pets, <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> is urging pet owners to take proper care of their animals during the "Dog Days of Summer" by having them <a href="../shop/grooming.htm">professionally groomed</a> every 4-6 weeks.

<p>

There are several reasons why it is particularly important to have pets groomed during the summer months, according to Maggie Thompson, director of <a href="../shop/grooming.htm">grooming services</A> at <a href="../../">PETsMART</a>.  "As the environment heats up, fleas and ticks become a serious problem for animals, and pets' skin becomes dry and itchy," said Thompson.  "Heavy winter fur can make the summer heat unbearable for pets, having them groomed removes a large portion of the undercoat of fur that has accumulated over the winter season and helps them stay <font color="#0000ff">cooler</font>," added Thompson.

<p>

Nail trimming and cleaning pets' ears and anal glands are aspects of grooming that many pet owners often overlook.  Nail trimming is important because untrimmed nails can cause physical pain in pets' paws and even lead to foot deformity.  When pets have dirty ears,  they may become itchy, smelly and uncomfortable.  

<p>

Thompson also notes that dogs that drag their rear ends across the carpet may need to have their anal glands cleaned.  This will not only stop the unsightly behavior, but the cleaning will also relieve the dog from the uncomfortable condition.

<p>

<a href="../../">PETsMART</a> has implemented a national certification program for all its store groomers.  "Because there is no national licensing for verifying a groomer's technical and safety qualifications, <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> has created an internal certification program to ensure consumers' that their pets will receive the safest possible grooming services at all <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> locations," said Thompson.	

<p>

A <a href="../shop/grooming.htm">full service grooming</a> at <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> includes ear cleaning, brushing, bathing, nail trimming, customized hair cut, cleaning of the anal glands and paw pad trimming.

<p>

For those pet owners who choose to groom their pets at home, <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> provides the following tips:

<ul>

<li> Always use a no-tear shampoo, especially on the head.  The wrong shampoo can be damaging to the pets' eyes.

<li> People shampoos are not pH-balanced for pets which can cause severe skin irritation for animals.  <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> recommends using a pet shampoo which is specifically  pH-balanced for animals.

<li> An excessive amount of water in pets' ears may lead to infections, so <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> groomers suggests placing cotton balls in your pets' ears while bathing them.  This will help prevent water from draining into their ears.

<li> Skin problems can easily arise in dogs with wrinkles (i.e. Pugs, Shar Peis), so owners should be sure that they are cleaning their dogs carefully in between the folds in their dogs' skin.

<li> Always be on the look-out if your pets are scratching a lot or have specks of dried blood on their skin -- these are signs that your pet may have fleas or ticks.

<li> Be sure to trim your pets nails properly.  Not trimming them or trimming them too short can cause pain and discomfort for your pet.

</ul>

<a href="../../">PETsMART</a>, the nation's largest pet superstore chain, is the industry leader in the pet food and supply business with 1995 sales exceeding one billion dollars.  <a href="../../">PETsMART</a> currently operates over <a href="../shop/locator.htm">300 superstores in 33 states</a>.  The company is publicly traded on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol <a href="../petsmart/quote.htm">PETM</a>.

how to get out of it can save his life.</i><p>—by Gary Wilkes

</center><p>



Few pet owners teach their dogs to swim. Those dogs that readily take

to water are trusted immediately, while non-swimmers are barred from

the pool for life. Ironically, it is the non-swimmer that needs to know

about water safety most. A dog that is not allowed in the pool may

still accidentally end up in the water. Teaching water safety does not

require that you teach your dog to swim. You only need to teach Bowser

how to get out of the water.

<p>

Dogs do not swim like humans. A dog holds his nose out of the water and

paddles vigorously with his legs. His eyes are positioned behind his

nose. This is the equivalent view that you would have if you were

floating on your back, being towed by your feet. In order to keep his

nose above water, he must hold his head at an angle looking up. He is

seeing the roof of your house and the sky. Because his nose is in the

way, he might see the edge of the pool with his peripheral vision, but

he can't see anything directly ahead or underwater. Until his foot hits

something solid he has no idea where the pool steps are. The decorative

tile on the edge of the pool gives no clue about how to escape. You

must teach him elevated landmarks that lead to the steps out of the

pool.

<p>

Long coated dogs and puppies have an additional problem. As their coats

get soaked, it becomes harder to move through the water. Imagine

swimming in the ocean while wearing a mink coat. The dog soon tires and

his hindquarters start to sink lower in the water. Now, the dog is

merely concerned with keeping his nose above water. He has no way to

hold his breath and float as a human might. Exhaustion quickly leads to

drowning.

<p>

The first step to protecting your dog is to identify for him the way

out of the pool. Because the dog is looking up while swimming, you must

place a readily observable object high enough to he visible to the dog.

Get in the pool and swim with your eyes just above the water. Select a

point that is observable from any spot in the pool that always leads to

the steps. Use this spot to orient your dog to the escape route.

<p>

Once you have selected your exit point, you must choose a suitable

landmark to guide your dog. Dogs primarily see in shades of gray rather

than in color. You should pick something that incorporates highly

contrasting tones like black and white, rather than colored objects. If

your pool has a fence, you can candy stripe a vertical part of the

fence with contrasting tape. Select the one bar that can be seen from

all points in the pool, or a section of the top rail of the fence.

Another alternative would be a bamboo pole, striped with black tape and

mounted vertically in the ground or securely to the fence. For

decorative purposes you might add a whirligig or a windsock. Dogs see

movement very well, even in dim light.

<p>

The next step is to place the dog in the pool. Attach a long,

lightweight rope to his collar to pull him out in case of an emergency.

Leave enough slack to allow him free movement. Start with the dog one

body length away from the exit point. As the dog is released, call to

him. When his foot touches the step, continue coaxing until he gets

completely out of the water. Give him special treats, praise and

affection for successfully exiting the

pool. Gradually increase the distance that he must go to find the

steps. When Bowser can escape the pool from any point, reduce your

involvement by leaving the pool area completely after releasing him

into the water. His only guide to safety will be the visual aids you

have placed near the steps. Watch very carefully from a hiding place

and be prepared to get him out quickly at the first signs of

difficulty.

<p>

If you are working with a puppy, he cautious about overextending the

workout. Puppies tire suddenly. If his hindquarters start to sink lower

in the water, be prepared to jump in and get him, or pull him out with

a rope. Try not to traumatize him, but get him out quickly. Repeat this

routine until Bowser can escape from anywhere in the pool by himself.

Water safety is all often overlooked part of our dogs' training.

Regardless of whether your dog is allowed in the pool, you should make

the effort to teach him to get out of one.

<i>How can you save on vetrinary fees and protect your cat? Don't put off vaccinations, that's how. Here's how vaccinations work and they can and can't do.</i>

<p>

BY LARRY M. HAWK DVM

<p>

<img align=right src=images/catvac.gif>

<b>What are infectious diseases?</b><br>

Infectious diseases and their complications are among the most common reasons why cat owners seek veterinary care. And they are among the most expensive to treat. An infectious disease is often caused by a virus or bacteria that invades your cat's body. While some are mere nuisances, like the common cold, others can cause serious, even fatal diseases. Today, vaccinations make it possible to avoid these diseases altogether, or to reduce their severity.

<p>

<b>How vaccinations work.</b><br>

There are two ways to become immune or resistant to a disease. Catch the disease—in this case, your cat's body produces proteins called antibodies that destroy the disease-producing organism Your cat probably won't catch the disease again if it is exposed. This is called natural immunity. The problem with natural immunity is your cat may die from the infection, you may be presented with a large veterinary bill for treatment, or both.<br>

That's why vaccines were developed. The artificial immunity induced by a vaccine can he as effective as natural immunity, without the cost of treatment, and without the risk of death. Your veterinarian gives your cat a vaccine made with dead or harmless versions of the organism that will help ward off infection if or when your cat is exposed to the real thing.

<p>

<b>What vaccines can prevent.</b><ul>

<li>Feline panleukopenia (distemper) is a disease very easily transmitted from cat to cat. It affects your cat's digestive and immune or defense systems. It causes severe clinical signs and can be fatal.

<li>Upper respiratory disease (commonly called colds) may be caused by several types of bacteria and viruses. Two viruses cause the most serious and  frequent disease: rhinotracheitis (a herpes virus) and calicivirus. These viruses affect the nose, eyes, throat, and lungs, are and are highly contagious. In their most severe form, they can predispose your  cat to pneumonia. Another organism called a chlamydia causes mild upper respiratory disease.

<li>Rabies is caused by a virus. When most people think of rabies they think of "mad" dogs and wildlife. But cats are the domesticated animal with the highest number of reported cases each year. And rabies has moved to the suburbs. Foxes, skunks, raccoons, and bats are common carriers. Rabies affects the nervous system, and you and your family are susceptible if bitten by a rabid animal.

<li>Feline leukemia virus is the number one cause of cancer in cats. It also causes many more diseases that are fatal. Among these are susceptibility to infections and suppression of the immune or defense system.

<li>Feline infectious peritonitis is caused by a virus. It affects most parts of a cat's body and is often fatal. Though it isn’t as contagious as other diseases it is best prevented.

Vaccines exist to prevent feline panlculiopenia, upper respiratory disease, rabies feline leukemia virus, and feline infectious peritonitis. While no vaccine is 100% effective, clinical signs of infection are often less severe if a cat has been vaccinated.</ul>

<p>

<b>When your cat needs vaccinations.</b><br>

Your veterinarian will recommend a vaccination schedule for kittens that includes several shots in a series (see chart). A series is necessary because kittens receive antibodies in their mothers milk that protect them against disease, but these antibodies usually disappear when the kitten is 8- to 16-weeks old. Because there is no inexpensive way to predict when this will

happen, a series of shots helps ensure the Kitten is protected at all times.

Adult cats need yearly vaccinations to ensure that protective levels of antibodies remain high.

<p>

<b>But my cat never leaves the house.</b><br>

Staying inside reduces exposure to disease, but, "never goes outside" is not a valid reason not to vaccinate your cats. consider these points:

<ul><li>Your cat will visit the veterinarian when it's sick.

<li>Your cat may have to be boarded under emergency situations, or when you go on vacation.

<li>You or a friend may bring a highly contagious cold virus to your home on clothing, hands, or shoes.

<li>Vaccines can only prevent a disease, not cure one after your cat is infected.

<li>Older cats are more susceptible to disease, so don't take a chance.</ul>

<p>

Remember, every cat should have protection against diseases. Annual vaccination is one of the most important and least expensive things you can do to protect your cat's health

<i>Getting his "shots" probably isn't something you look forward to. But it's an inexpensive way of preventing diseases that can harm you and your pooch.</i>

<p>

BY LARRY M. HAWK DVM

<p>

<img align=right src=images/shots1.gif>

All dogs need preventive medicine. That's why veterinarians recommend annual checkups and immunizations. Think of yearly immunizations as a low-cost insurance policy; a policy designed to protect your pet against costly, perhaps fatal, diseases caused by viruses and bacteria. The chart summarizes what you need to know. In some cases you'll need to ask your veterinarian if a disease is common where you live. Here's a quick review.

<p>

Rabies can affect all warm-blooded animals. Though widespread immunization of dogs and cats has reduced the incidence of rabies in people, the disease is still around. And it's of special concern because it affects people and is almost always fatal. Dogs acquire the disease when they are bitten by a rabid animal,

usually a skunk, bat, raccoon or fox. Unfortunately, these wild animals—and rabies—have resurfaced in urban areas.

<p>

Rabies affects the nervous system. Signs include lack of coordination, behavioral changes, paralysis, and death. Excellent vaccines exist to pre-vent infection. Some of these protect for one year; others for three.

<p>

Distemper is a highly contagious, frequently fatal viral disease. The virus is transmitted in body secretions from infected dogs. The disease primarily affects the respiratory system (causing nasal and eye discharges and pneumonia); the digestive system (causing vomiting and diarrhea); and the nervous system (causing weakness, incoordination, and convulsions). A dog can apparently recover from distemper only to be affected by nervous system signs later on. No drug can cure distemper; prevention through immunization is best.

<p>

Infectious canine hepatitis is caused by an adenovirus. This virus is spread from dog-to-dog in urine or stools. In fact, the virus may appear for up to a year in the urine of affected dogs. Then, depending on temperature and humidity, the virus may survive from a few days to months in the environment, where it can infect another dog.

<p>

The virus affects the liver and the lining of blood vessels, and the disease it produces can he fatal. The hepatitis virus is closely related to another adenovirus (adenovirus-2) that causes mild respiratory clinical signs. Manufacturers use this latter virus in vaccines because it is safer and protects against disease caused by both viruses.

<p>

Kennel cough or infectious tracheobronchitis is an acute, highly infectious disease of the upper and lower respiratory tract. Signs include recurring episodes of coughing made worse by exercise, excitement, or pressure on the trachea (windpipe). The cough often sounds like a goose honk and the coughing spells frequently end with gagging.

<p>

Several viruses and bacteria cause kennel cough. Among these are the distemper and hepatitis viruses, adenovirus-2 and the canine parainfluenza virus. Bordetella bronchiseptica) is the most important bacterial agent. All of these viruses and bacteria are transmitted by droplets in the air. Any one of these disease agents acting alone might cause pneumonia, but death is rare. However, combined infections—a virus and Bordetella—produce more serious signs.

<p>

Vaccines and bacterins (bacterins are made from bacteria; vaccines from viruses) can help prevent infection and reduce its severity. These countermeasures to Bordetella and parainfluenza are available as injectable products and as products that can be given by nose. Your veterinarian will recommend

products that are best suited to prevent kennel cough in your dog.

<p>

Canine parvovirus (parvo) affects the digestive tract of susceptible dogs and the digestive tract and heart muscle of puppies. Dogs become infected when they ingest or inhale the virus. Common signs are vomiting

and diarrhea, which may be severe and life-threatening. Like the distemper and hepatitis viruses, the canine parvovirus can severely suppress a dog’s  immune or protective system, leading to infection by bacteria and other  viruses. The hepatitis virus can survive from months to years in the environment.

<p>

Safe, effective vaccines are available and should be given annually. Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, and black Labrador Retrievers are more seriously affected than other breeds.

<p>

Canine coronavirus produces a less serious disease also characterized by

vomiting and diarrhea. Such an infection combined with canine parvovirus often produces a more serious disease than does either virus individually. Your veterinarian may recommend vaccination.

<p>

Leptospirosis is a disease caused by bacteria. Dogs develop the disease when they arc exposed to infected urine or contaminated soil, food or water. Leptospirosis usually affects the liver, kidneys, and blood vessels. Infected dogs transmit infective bacteria in urine

for months. Humans can be infected by the bacteria that cause leptospirosis.

<p>

Lyme disease is caused by an organism called a spirochete. This spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted to animals including man, by ticks. Lameness is the most common sign, but the kidneys, heart and nervous system may be

affected, too. Bacterins are available and should be used if your dog lives or vacations in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent.

<p>

<b>What about my puppy?</b><br>

Your dog has many mechanisms that help defend against infectious diseases. One mechanisms is antibodies Antibodies are proteins that inactivate viruses and bacteria. Dogs have two kinds of antibodies: those acquired passively and those acquired actively. Actively immunity results from immunizations. Passive immunity occurs when a puppy receives antibodies from its mother before it's born or through nursing. Although protective, these antibodies usually disappear when a puppy is 6-16 weeks old. Veterinarians give immunizations to puppies every 2-,5 weeks starting at 6-8 weeks of age (see the accompanying> chart) because there's no way to predict when passive immunity will disappear in a puppy.

<p>

<b>But my dog never goes out of the yard...</b><br>

Confinement may lessen a dog's chances for exposure; however, viruses and bacteria can be transmitted by air, clothing, or other pets through fences. Further, many viruses persist for months in the environment. Despite your best precautions, your dog may be exposed when you take it for a walk. And wild animals (bats, raccoons) that harbor the rabies virus can get into your yard. Bats are notorious for flying in windows and down chimneys. Chances are your dog is exposed to disease-causing agents more frequently than you realize. And protective antibody levels to many viruses and bacteria wane about one year after immunizations are given. That's why annual immunizations are so important.<br>

<i>Because your dog can't brush or floss, it depends on you and your veterinarian for a regular regimen of cleaning to maintain healthy teeth and gums</i>

<p>

BY LARRY M. HAWK DVM

<p>

Periodontal disease affects almost all dogs two years old and older. Left unchecked the disease causes pain, bad breath, unnecessary tooth loss, and possible damage to internal organs. Here's what you can do to slow or pre-vent these problems.

Plaque, a colorless film of bacteria, cells, and food, is the primary cause of periodontal disease. Like in humans, periodontal disease doesn't occur if plaque accumulation is prevented. Daily removal is best; however, plaque removal three times per week may be adequate. Therefore, it's important for you to remove plaque from your dog s teeth as often as you can.

<p>

<b>Steps You Can Do</b><br>

Home dental care can be started at any age, but it's best to see your veterinarian first. He or she will examine your pets mouth for evidence of gum disease. If necessary, he or she will remove plaque and tartar from your dog's teeth and restore periodontal health. Your veterinarian or veterinary technician can show you how to brush your dog's teeth and recommend effective products for you to use at home.<p>

Here's a brief summary of what you'll learn. First, train your dog so it allows you to handle its muzzle and

open its mouth. Select a quiet, non-threatening area of your home and begin by petting and rubbing your dog's muzzle and mouth. You may find it easiest to hold your dog if it's small. Praise your dog as needed.<p>

After several sessions, pull your dog's lips back to expose its teeth. If your dog doesn't object to this, use a finger to rub the outside tooth surfaces. Don't force the issue; you don't want to be bitten. Ideally, you should remove plaque from all tooth surfaces, including those facing the tongue. However, many dogs won't tolerate this and you can easily be bitten when you put your fingers between your dog's teeth. So concentrate on the outside surfaces of the larger teeth in the back of your

dog's mouth and the canine teeth (large teeth in front.)<p>

Once your dog allows you to rub your finger on its teeth you are ready for the second step. Using a gauze pad, cloth, or soft-bristled toothbrush, brush your dog's teeth in a circular motion. Use only brushes made for dogs; brushes made for people may cause gum damage because they are too hard. Your veterinarian may recommend a toothpaste made for dogs. Many products of this nature are flavored and contain plaque-reducing agents. Several gels, sprays, and rinses can also be used to help prevent plaque accumulation. Use only those recommended by your veterinarian.

It's a good idea to check with your veterinarian or veterinary technician after you've begun a home care dental program. These professionals can increase the effectiveness of your pro-gram by answering your questions and pointing out areas missed by your brushing technique.<p>

Despite your best efforts some dogs simply won't allow their mouths to he manipulated. To preserve oral health for these dogs your veterinarian may recommend professional cleanings one-to-four times per year and materials he or she thinks may retard plaque accumulation.

Even if your dog cooperates completely, your veterinarian should check your dog's teeth at least once a year for evidence of gum disease, loose teeth, and other problems.



<p>

<b>Dental Care For Puppies</b><br>

If you are thinking of getting a new puppy you have an excellent chance to begin an effective oral care program. Begin by selecting the right puppy. Generally, smaller dogs have more dental problems. This is especially tale for dogs with short muzzles and dogs with bottom jaws that extend significantly past the upper jaw. See your veterinarian immediately after you find a puppy you like. He or she can counsel you regarding potential dental problems.

After you obtain a new puppy, begin manipulating its muzzle and mouth frequently. Such efforts greatly facilitate a dental program later on.

Deciduous (baby) teeth are replaced by permanent teeth when a puppy is four-months old. Baby teeth not replaced by permanent teeth may cause the permanent teeth to erupt abnormally and may trap food and bacteria leading to periodontal disease.

<p>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>

The accompanying figure shows some of the more common dental problems of dogs. The table gives you more information about their diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

Your dog's dental and oral health depend on professional care and more importantly your dedication to frequent plaque removal.

<font size =+2>The Truth: <b>About Premium Foods</b></font><br>



Concerned pet owners often ask if there is a difference between premium foods like Authority™ and other less expensive brands? The answer is yes. 

<br><br>

All major brands of pet food sold in the United States must meet stringent requirements and minimal nutritional standards which are imposed by The National Research Council.

<br><br>Each of these foods, served in conjunction with an ample supply of fresh clean water along with regular veterinarian visits, will sustain a healthy pet.

<br><br>

<font size=+1>Measures of Quality</font><br><br>



Authority™, however, goes a step beyond typical grocery brands. Authority™ formulas are made from the highest quality grade of ingredients like poultry by-product meal, beef tallow and ground yellow corn. These ingredients were individually selected and tested to provide your pet with optimum nutrition.  When you purchase Authority™, your pet receives premium formulas designed to optimally meet the nutritional needs for their age and activity level.

<br><br>

Authority™ underwent extensive manufacturer testing to guarantee quality performance in animal nutrition and good taste. A balanced, nutritionally complete diet is essential for fostering and maintaining a state of optimum well-being in your pet.



<br><br>

<font size=+1>Prove It to Yourself</font><br><br>



An easy way to check the quality of a pet food is to smell, touch and examine it. A good pet food has a pleasing aroma which attracts your pet and adds to the overall palatability.

<br><br>

Look for consistency in the texture, shape and size. The texture needn’t be perfectly smooth, but it should be of a consistent nature with enough hardness to help ensure good oral hygiene.

<br><br>

Authority™ is formulated in shapes that feel good in your pets' mouth.

<br><br>

Each bag of Authority™ Individual open code dating. This date is your guarantee of freshness.

<TITLE>RESEARCH SECTION FOR RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH
AND SAFETY, INSTITUTE OF ATOMIC ENERGY,
KYOTO UNIVERSITY</TITLE>


<H2>Project</H2>

<H3>I. Research on Aerosols</H3>

Current research concerns various aspects of the characterization  and behavior of 
aerosol particles including generation and measurement of small aerosol particles and 
identifying morphological characteristics of irregularly shaped particles. Dynamic 
behavior using generalized dynamic equations are among the other topics being studied.

<H3>II. Dynamics and Measurement of Aerosol Particles by Dynamic Light Scattering</H3>

An experimental system consisting of a photon correlation laser light scattering 
spectro-meter with a quadrupole cell and two-color laser Doppler velocimeter is being 
employed for experimental studies on the measurement of particle veloclity in various 
fields as well as sizing of particles. Heating of aerosol particles by laser light 
irradiation and their subsequent dynamic behavior are also being studied.

<H3>III. Particulate Air Pollutants</H3>
  
Photochemical aerosol formation from multi-component systems of gaseous pollutants and 
pre-existing particles are being studied experimentally. Kinetic models are also being 
studied for describing the nucleation and evolution of particles in a reaction chamber 
and in the atmosphere.
  
Research is also conducted on the source apportionment of particulate matter in ambient
air using the receptor model. Reliability and applicability of the model are examined 
by mathematical procedures. The PIXE method is being employed for chemical analysis of 
multi-elements in atmospheric aerosols.

<H3>IV. Lung Dynamics of Inhaled Aerosol Particles</H3>
  
Dynamic behavior of aerosol particles in a variety of airways is studied both 
theoretically and experimentally. Mathematical models for particle deposition in 
human and other mammalian lungs are being improved based on more detailed lung models 
and then applied to the evaluation of species-dependence of inhaled particle deposition.

<TITLE>CHAIR OF WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE ENGINEERING</TITLE>


<H2>Project</H2>

<H3>I.    Studies on Risk Assessment of Water Supply Systems</H3>

To obtain safe and stable water supplies, risks in municipal water supply 
systems should be analyzed.  Several different aspects to this problem are 
being examined. The possibility of water  contamination by harmful substances 
such as viruses, heavy metals and carcinogens is being studied in the field. 
Dose-Response relations of such harmful substances are being investigated
using  mice.  In  addition,  chromosome  damage  is  being  investigated using 
Chinese-Hamster-Lung  (CHL) cells. Other work includes the analysis of the 
destruction rate of pipe-line system by  earthquakes. A current major interest 
is in how to control water supply systems considering these quantified risks.

<H3>II.    Studies on Advanced Treatment of Water Supplies</H3>
    
A  major  quality  problem  in  supplied water is odor formation in eutrophicated
water resources.  To  reduce  odor,  research  is being conducted on the 
biodegradation of odorous compounds  by  bacteria.  The mechanism of biological 
degradation of odor (2-methyl-isoborneol) by gram negative bacteria which are 
separated in slow sand filters is also being investigated.

<H3>III. Biological Removal of Dissolved Substances in the Rapid Sand Filtration Process</H3>
   
It  has  been  shown  that bacteria effective at odor decomposition maintain 
this ability in alum  floc  for  a  long period. However, dissolved substances 
cannot reach the bacteria inside the  floc.  By  breaking  up  the  floc some 
dissolved substances can be decomposed by bacteria dispersed  in  water.  The  
design changes required to add such biological effects in the rapid
sand filtration process are now being investigated experimentally.

<H3>IV. Modeling of Global Environment</H3>

Modeling  and  projecting  the  global environment with qualitative analysts. 
Global environmental  problems.  such  as  the global warming, acid precipitation, 
are the main targets. Coupling of social, economical and natural scientific points 
of view, obtaining comprehensive aspects/projections  of  the problems are the 
objective of the study. To support this approach, global environmental database 
and geographic information systems are developed.

<TITLE>CHAIR OF ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS ENGINEERING</TITLE>

<H2>Project</H2>

<H3>I.    Solid Waste Management</H3>

In  the  area of solid waste management, a thermal processing of solid wastes 
(municipal and industrial refuse and sewage sludge) is being studied. Pyrolysis 
and incineration of combustible solid  wastes  are  being  examined with the goal
of minimization of environmental impact. A design  procedure  and  an  energy  
and cost estimation method are being developed for solid waste treatment  systems.  
An automatic measurement and statistical analysis of operation data is also
being applied to a drying fluidized-bed incineration plant for sewage sludge, and 
a chlorination of flyash to recover heavy metals is being investigated experimentally.

<H3>II.    Control of Micropollutants form Waste Incineration</H3>

Incineration  of  waste  seems  to  be one of the major sources of micropollutants,  
such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and Mercury (Hg).    The  purpose  
of this research is to  study  sampling  and analytical methods, reduction by 
improvement of plant operation and removal  in  air  pollution  control  units.  
Catalytic destruction of PCDDs ad related compounds. and  Hg  removal  mechanism 
in fabric filtration are being investigated experimentally. In addition  to these, 
a compartmental model is being used to calculate the environmental concentration
of micropollutants in order to estimate the impact of micropollutants to the 
environment.

<H3>III. Computer Simulation of Fluid Dynamics</H3>
  
Calculation  procedures  of  fluid dynamics are being studied to predict and 
understand complicated flow behavior related to the transportation process of 
pollutants in the atmosphere and  the  turbulent  flow  fields  with  heat and 
mass transfer phenomena in incineration furnaces of solid  waste.  
Numerical calculations including modeling are being performed under different 
initial,  boundary  and geometrical conditions. Calculated velocity and 
temperature distribution are compared with measurements, and chemical reactions 
are coupled with the fluid dynamics.

<TITLE>CHAIR OF ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE</TITLE>


<H2>Project</H2>

<H3>I. Studies on Effects of Noise on Man</H3>

The  effect  of noise on hearing is the major area of interest and is investigated 
by means of the  frequency  selectivity  and  TTS  (temporary  threshold shift) 
experiments. The speech perception  of  persons  whose hearing is impaired due 
to noise is also being studied. In addition, blood pressure  rise  evoked  by  
noise  exposure is being investigated taking the method of synchronized
averaging  of  continuously  measured  blood  pressure.  Human  reaction  to 
environmental noise is investigated by laboratory experiments and field surveys.

<H3>II.    Studies on the Propagation of Noise</H3>
   
The  approximate  expressions  which  describe  sound  propagation  over  a 
single for a double wedge  with  absorptive  surfaces  are derived theoretically 
from the expression given for the case of  a  single  reflective  wedge.  
The  approximate  expressions for sound diffraction by a barrier standing  on  
the  plane  or  wedge  shaped  gouund  are  also obtained. The values calculated 
from these  expressions  and  the  values  obtained  from  scale-model  
experiments show good agreement. Sound propagation from sources of various size 
is also investigated.

<H3>III.    Studies on Atmospheric Diffusion of Air Pollutants</H3>
    
In  order  to  investigate methods for predicting the environmental concentration 
of pollutants emitted  from  stationary  sources  or  automobiles,  results of 
wind tunnel experiments. diffusion equation  calculation  and  numerical  
simulations  are  compared  with  the  results obtained from field  experiments  
and  field  surveys.  The  analysis has shown that wind tunnel experiments give
a  prediction  which  shows  reasonably good agreement with the results obtained 
in the field for a complex terrain.

Studies  on  predicting  the  potential hazards caused by the accidental spill 
of dense gas are also  being  carried  out.  The  simulation  model  for  dense 
gas spill which assumed nonexistence of lift-off. bifurcation and rapid phase 
transition, has been successful in predicting average concentration at the 
downwind distance from spill point.

<H2>Project</H2>

<H3>I.    Wastewater Treatment</H3>

Studies  on  wastewater  treatment  processes using bacteria immobilized with 
magnetic particles  aim  to  develop  efficient  methods for removing recalcitrant
or toxic organics as well as biodegradable  substances.  The  immobilized  bacteria
can  be  recovered by a conventional or a high  gradient  magnetic  separators.  
Studies  on  aerobic  and anaerobic sequencing batch activated  sludge  (AOSBAS) 
and  oxidation  ditch  (OD) processes  deal with modeling of the kinetics of  
removing  organic  substances,  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  compounds  in  AOSBAS 
and organics and  nitrogen  in  OD  Indexes  and  criteria for optimum design and 
operation of these processes have  also  been  proposed.  Studies  on  attached 
growth biological processes deal with modeling of the substrate removal kinetics, 
taking into account nitrification, denitrification,  lysis and growth,  and  
biodegradation  pathways  of  toxic  organics in aerobic or anaerobic fluidized bed
reactors.  The  introduction  of  genetic  engineering for the biodegradation of 
recalcitrant and toxic organics is also investigated.

<H3>II.    Solid Waste Management</H3>
    
Studies  on  inland and seashore sanitary reclamation include modeling of 
biological and physicochemical  processes and water behavior in wastes beds, 
prediction of the quantity and quality of  leachate  in  an  inland  reclamation 
site, and development of biological and physicochemical treatments  for leachate. 
Studies on generation of domestic wastes deal with statistical analysis and  
prediction  of  municipal  wastes based on socio-economic data, and prediction 
of the annual wastes  based  on  consumer  statistics.  Studies  on the evaluation 
of wastes recycling include. analysis  of  the  components  of  durable  consumer  
goods, reusability evaluation of the wasted goods, and evaluation of effect with 
recycling by a life-cycle assessment model.

<H3>III. Micropollutants in the Environment</H3>
    
A  framework  for  the  risk assessment methodology of non-degradable toxic 
pollutants is developed  by  mathematical  modeling  including  several routes 
of transport to man and by estimation  of  the  load.  Applications of this 
framework are conducted to evaluate the adverse effect of  toxic  metals  in  
off-gas from an incineration plant to the surrounding environment. Studies on  
the  movement  and  fate  of xenobiotic organic pollutants in the subsurface 
environment deal with  physicochemical  and  biological behavior of these pollutants 
in the soil and aquifers. The transport  and  potential  biological effects are 
investigated with batch and column experiments.
And the ultimate fate of these pollutants is predicted by mathematical model.

<H2>Project</H2>

<H3>I.    Development of High Level Sewerage System and Advanced Sewage Treatment System</H3>

Comprehensive  treatment  process  which  is  composed of physical, chemical and 
biological unit-processes  is  under  developing  for  advanced  treatment of 
domestic sewage. Main performance objectives of this treatment process are 
focused on the high level removal of not only organic  pollutants  but  also  
nitrogen  and phosphorus. Chemical coagulation, sedimentation, ozonation,  and  
biofilm  reactor  are  arranged  in this order. Coagulated raw sludge is subjected 
to organic  acid  fermentation  process  with FM filter system. The organic acid 
produced is applied to denitrification process for hydrogen donor.

<H3>II.    Biological Nitrification and Denitrification</H3>

Two  species  of bacteria which have special potential to perform aerobic 
denitification have been  isolated from activated sludge obtained at a night soil 
treatment plant. These bacteria are applied  to  bench  scale  plant  for  
simultaneous removals of organics and nitrogen. The detail mechanism of aerobic 
denitrification is also under observation and analyzing.

Attached  microbe type reactors for nitrification and denitrification are also 
under studies. The  pilot  plant  filled  with  polyurethane  foam cubes has been 
operated in a municipal sewage treatment  plant.  For  the  biological  treatment  
of high concentration of ammonium nitrogen. a reactor with zeolite as medium is 
studied. In this reactor, both ion-exchange of ammonia to zeolite and nitrification 
by attached bacteria on the zeolite are expected.

<H3>III. Algal Bloom Mechanism Analysis and Its Control in Lake and Dam</H3>
   
Fresh water red tide could often be observed in a rather oligotrophic and 
mesotrophic lake or  dam.  This  phenomenon  is  occurred by accumulation of a 
special species of algae in a small area. In order to recognize the accumulation 
mechanism, a lot of field survey and study has been conducted.

Soluble organics excreted through algal growth should be noticed in an eutrophic 
water body. These organics are important from the view point of control factor for 
sequential growth of  algal species as well as organic pollution. Mechanisms of 
excretion of this organics, control pattern against algal species. and degradation 
of this organics by bacteria are studied.

<H3>IV. Evaluation of Genotoxicity on Micropollutants in Aquatic Environments</H3>
  
Some chemicals contained in aquatic environment have genotoxicity and/or mutagenecity.
for example. organochlorine compounds produced by chlorination of water and 
wastewater. chlorophenols used in pesticides and herbicides. heterocyclic amine in 
night soil from human excreta, and chemicals used in industries like dying. 
In this research, the genotoxicity is evaluated quantitatively by using the 
umu-test which can detect the gene induction of error in repair of damaged DNA, 
chromosomal aberrations in chinese hamster's long cell and DNA damages
on oncogene.

<H3>V . Study on Chlorination and Ozonation</H3>
  
Studies on chlorination and ozonation in water quality control have involved 
three major areas of interest. Trihalomethane formation mechanisms and quantity 
of formation in chlorination processes is one aspect of study. The second area 
involves an experimental study of the effect of ozonation on the decomposition 
of precusors to odorous materials in raw drinking water. In addition. genotoxicity
of by-products formed in chlorination and ozonation has been evaluated through 
study of the mutation of bacterial and animal cells.

<TITLE>CHAIR OF RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH ENGINEERING</TITLE>

<H2>Project</H2>

<H3>I.    Dynamic  Behavior  of  Radionuclides  in  Natural  and  Social  Environment and Hazard Evaluation</H3>

Radionuclides  released  into  the  environment  are  dispersed in the media and 
concentrated in  various  foodstuffs  along  many  pathways.  Since  these  
foodstuffs are eventually consumed. they  represent  an  important  potential  
pathway  for  radionuclide  accumulation  in  the human body.  Ecological  models  
are  constructed based on deterministic, stochastic and/or fuzzy modeling  
techniques,  and  are  examined  to evaluate the dynamic behavior of fallout 
radionuclides as well as potential health hazards.

<H3>II.    Behavior and Control of Hazardous Materials in a Vadose Zone</H3>
    
Many   hazardous  materials  are  released  primarily  into  the  unsaturated  soil  
formations (vadose  zone) near  the  ground  surface.  These  materials  can  be  
transported  upward  to the ground  surface  where  they  accumulate,  and/or  
downward  to the saturated zone causing groundwater  contamination.  The  mechanism  
of  migration  for  these  materials  is  being studied experimentally.  Mathematical
models  are  also being formulated to find feasible engineering safeguards for 
control of soil and groundwater contamination.

<H3>III. Ecological Modeling and Control of Lake Eutrophication</H3>

The purpose of this project is to evaluate the eutrophication of lakes and rivers, 
in particular  Lake Biwa (located near Kyoto), in relation to the social activities 
of the surrounding area. The  nutrient  (nitrogen and phosphorus) loading to the 
lake and the concentration of nutrients in the  lake  were  estimated  based  on  
population and industrial and agricultural activity. A dynamic  eutrophication  
model  of  Lake  Biwa has been constructed to obtain a quantitative relationship 
between the amount of nutrients and plankton biomass.

IV. Computer Simulation of Regional Groundwater Contamination
    
The  convective  dispersion  model is used in most cases to evaluate regional 
soil and groundwater  contamination,  however,  systematic  treatment  of  many 
kinds of environmental parameters are  required  to  obtain practical and reliable 
simulation results. In this project, mathematical approaches  such  as  stochastic 
identification of hydrogeological parameters. conditional simulation  and  fuzzy  
models are being examined for practical application to regional groundwater 
contamination and design of monitoring systems.

<TITLE>ENVIRONMENT PRESERVATION CENTER,
KYOTO UNIVERSITY
</TITLE>


<H2>Project</H2>

<H3>I.    Studies on Disposal of Organic and Inorganic Liquid Wastes</H3>

The  Environmental  Preservation  center manages and maintains disposal facilities for 
organic  and  inorganic  liquid wastes. Organic and inorganic wastes are disposed of 
by an incinerator with  a high speed rotary burner and ferrite process, respectively. 
To obtain effective operation of  the  ferrite process, the intensity of magnetization 
of ferromagnetic sludge is monitored and the effect of various concentrations of heavy 
metals in wastes on the intensity has been shown.

<H3>II.    Research  on  Education  in  Environmental  Science and Disposal of Waste Materials at Universities</H3>
    
The  question  of  how to establish a proper system for education in environmental 
science at the university level is being addressed through a survey of the curriculum 
and text-books for environmental  education  at various universities. As part of this 
evaluation, the disposal systems for  waste  materials  in  universities  are  being 
investigated and guidelines for environmental education are being re-assessed based on 
the results of this investigation.

<H3>III. Studies on Management of Household Refuse and Hazardous Solid Wastes</H3>
  
Research  on  the  composition  of  household  refuse is being carried out as means of 
developing better methods of waste reduction. Methods for disposal of problematic 
materials, such as dry batteries and plastic packaging, are also being studied. Safe 
treatment of chemical wastes from various industries is being discussed in a special 
committee.

<H3>IV. Studies on System Design of Solid Waste Management Processes</H3>
  
System analysis and design of solid waste treatment processes, such as those treating 
sewage sludge and municipal solid waste, are being carried out. Solid waste treatment 
systems typically consists of many unit processes such as biological, physical and 
thermochemical processes. Using mathematical models of each unit process, energy 
balance analysis and optimum design of the total sludge treatment system are being 
investigated.

   There is a lot of toxic chemicals such as PCDDs/PCDFs in fly ash. Therefore<BR>
it is recommended to remove toxic chemicals from fly ash. In the process of<BR>
extracting organochlorine compounds from fly ash, soxhlet extraction has <BR>
often been adopted. It needs a lot of organic solvent and has some harmful <BR>
to man. After the process, fly ash contains a lot of organic solvent. In <BR>
this study, we adopted supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with carbon <BR>
dioxide which had low toxicity and was rarely kept in fly ash. SFE is a<BR>
extraction method to use supercritical fluid. A fluid is classified as<BR>
supercritical if it is maintained above its critical temperature and its <BR>
critical pressure. Supercritical fluids exhibit some properties that make <BR>
them efficient solvents for extraction purpose. Using silica gel with<BR>
chlorobenzens, this study investigated the influence of pressure, temperature<BR>
and extracting time. As a result, there is a tendency that the recovery rate of<BR>
chlorobenzens increased under these condition of higher pressure and lower<BR>
temperature.<BR>
The recovery rate was more than 80 % at 300 atm, 50 degrees and 45 min.<BR>
Furthermore, we also used fly ash as a sample and compared the results by <BR>
both SFE and soxhlet extraction.<BR>

        After the beginning of 1990's, recycling of plastics has become<BR>
obligated due to packaging waste recycle law, and many study has been<BR>
conducted to reuse used plastics as petrochemical material which is not<BR>
suitable for reclamation and incineration disposal.  In such a study of so<BR>
called chemical recycle of used plastics, PVC with other plastic resin is<BR>
used as a sample, and mostly, the main object is to decompose residue after<BR>
dehydrochlorination and get oil. In this paper, I got material balance of<BR>
chlorine when pure PVC is sequently decomposed. Furthermore, I analyzed CBs<BR>
in the chlorine.<BR>
        In the process of decomposing PVC, hydrogenchloride, residue, tar,<BR>
and other gas were produced. At the temperature of 370Ž and400Ž, residue w<BR>
as about 40%, and tar was rare, so the sample turned into residue and gas.<BR>
As a result of analyzing the residual chlorine, dehydrochlorination ratio<BR>
is over 97% at 370Ž in 16.8minutes retention-time, and 91% at 400Ž in 8.4m<BR>
inutes retention-time. Some of the chlorine in residue was CBs. <BR>
        At the temperature of 600Ž and 800Ž, the ratio of residue was unde<BR>
r 10%, and the others were tar (about 20%) and gas. As a result of<BR>
analyzing the residual chlorine, dehydrochlorination ratio is over 99% at<BR>
both temperature in 8.4minutes retention-time. There was about 45mg of<BR>
chlorine in 1g of tar. Some of the chlorine in residue was CBs.<BR>

        This study investigates the efficiency of refuse derived fuel (RDF)<BR>
and Waste-to-Energy (WTE) system in consideration of energy utilization in<BR>
wide area. Following two systems are evaluated in view of energy,<BR>
environmental impact, and cost;<BR>
(1) All of municipal solid waste incinerators in certain area change the<BR>
RDF manufactories, and RDF transported to the RDF-to-energy plant are<BR>
generated.<BR>
(2) Large-scale municipal solid waste incinerators modify the efficient WTE<BR>
plants, small and medium-scale incinerators also change RDF manufactories<BR>
and RDF are generated in the same way.<BR>
        As a result, the latter is more effective from the energy and cost<BR>
than the former. We conclude RDF system is valid for the small and<BR>
medium-scale incinerators in energy utilization.<BR>

        This study evaluated the effect of (1) CaCO3 addition to artificial<BR>
solid waste (2) ammonium injection to secondary combustion chamber, on the<BR>
concentration of HCl, SOx, NOx, chlorobenzens, and chlorophenols in flue<BR>
gas with the laboratory scale fluidized bed furnace. Results are shown as<BR>
follows.<BR>
        (1) CaCO3 addition: When Ca/Cl2 ratio of solid waste was 2 or over,<BR>
HCl concentration in flue gas was reduced to less than 5% at secondary<BR>
chamber temperature 800Ž and SOx was perfectly eliminated from flue gas. Ch<BR>
lorobenzens in flue gas were reduced to about 30% and chlorophenols in flue<BR>
gas were reduced to 50% when Ca/Cl2 ratio was 3. NO concentration in flue<BR>
gas became higher by CaCO3 addition.<BR>
        (2) Ammonium injection: NO concentration in flue gas was reduced to<BR>
70% when NH3/NO ratio was 1. Chlorobenzens were reduced to about 50% when<BR>
NH3/NO ratio was 3, and reduced to 30% when NH3/NO ratio was 5.<BR>
        This study also evaluated the simultaneous measuring method of HCl<BR>
and SOx by the ion chromatography. With this method we could measure more<BR>
quickly than and as precise as the methods stipulated by JIS.<BR>

<H2> Abstract </H2>
<BR>
   There is a lot of toxic chemicals such as PCDDs/PCDFs in fly ash. Therefore<BR>
it is recommended to remove toxic chemicals from fly ash. In the process of<BR>
extracting organochlorine compounds from fly ash, soxhlet extraction has <BR>
often been adopted. It needs a lot of organic solvent and has some harmful <BR>
to man. After the process, fly ash contains a lot of organic solvent. In <BR>
this study, we adopted supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with carbon <BR>
dioxide which had low toxicity and was rarely kept in fly ash. SFE is a<BR>
extraction method to use supercritical fluid. A fluid is classified as<BR>
supercritical if it is maintained above its critical temperature and its <BR>
critical pressure. Supercritical fluids exhibit some properties that make <BR>
them efficient solvents for extraction purpose. Using silica gel with<BR>
chlorobenzens, this study investigated the influence of pressure, temperature<BR>
and extracting time. As a result, there is a tendency that the recovery rate of<BR>
chlorobenzens increased under these condition of higher pressure and lower<BR>
temperature.<BR>
The recovery rate was more than 80 % at 300 atm, 50 degrees and 45 min.<BR>
Furthermore, we also used fly ash as a sample and compared the results by <BR>
both SFE and soxhlet extraction.<BR>

<H2> Abstract </H2>
<BR>
        After the beginning of 1990's, recycling of plastics has become<BR>
obligated due to packaging waste recycle law, and many study has been<BR>
conducted to reuse used plastics as petrochemical material which is not<BR>
suitable for reclamation and incineration disposal.  In such a study of so<BR>
called chemical recycle of used plastics, PVC with other plastic resin is<BR>
used as a sample, and mostly, the main object is to decompose residue after<BR>
dehydrochlorination and get oil. In this paper, I got material balance of<BR>
chlorine when pure PVC is sequently decomposed. Furthermore, I analyzed CBs<BR>
in the chlorine.<BR>
        In the process of decomposing PVC, hydrogenchloride, residue, tar,<BR>
and other gas were produced. At the temperature of 370Ž and400Ž, residue w<BR>
as about 40%, and tar was rare, so the sample turned into residue and gas.<BR>
As a result of analyzing the residual chlorine, dehydrochlorination ratio<BR>
is over 97% at 370Ž in 16.8minutes retention-time, and 91% at 400Ž in 8.4m<BR>
inutes retention-time. Some of the chlorine in residue was CBs. <BR>
        At the temperature of 600Ž and 800Ž, the ratio of residue was unde<BR>
r 10%, and the others were tar (about 20%) and gas. As a result of<BR>
analyzing the residual chlorine, dehydrochlorination ratio is over 99% at<BR>
both temperature in 8.4minutes retention-time. There was about 45mg of<BR>
chlorine in 1g of tar. Some of the chlorine in residue was CBs.<BR>

<BR>
        This study investigates the efficiency of refuse derived fuel (RDF)<BR>
and Waste-to-Energy (WTE) system in consideration of energy utilization in<BR>
wide area. Following two systems are evaluated in view of energy,<BR>
environmental impact, and cost;<BR>
(1) All of municipal solid waste incinerators in certain area change the<BR>
RDF manufactories, and RDF transported to the RDF-to-energy plant are<BR>
generated.<BR>
(2) Large-scale municipal solid waste incinerators modify the efficient WTE<BR>
plants, small and medium-scale incinerators also change RDF manufactories<BR>
and RDF are generated in the same way.<BR>
        As a result, the latter is more effective from the energy and cost<BR>
than the former. We conclude RDF system is valid for the small and<BR>
medium-scale incinerators in energy utilization.<BR>

<H2> Abstract </H2>
<BR>
        This study evaluated the effect of (1) CaCO3 addition to artificial<BR>
solid waste (2) ammonium injection to secondary combustion chamber, on the<BR>
concentration of HCl, SOx, NOx, chlorobenzens, and chlorophenols in flue<BR>
gas with the laboratory scale fluidized bed furnace. Results are shown as<BR>
follows.<BR>
        (1) CaCO3 addition: When Ca/Cl2 ratio of solid waste was 2 or over,<BR>
HCl concentration in flue gas was reduced to less than 5% at secondary<BR>
chamber temperature 800Ž and SOx was perfectly eliminated from flue gas. Ch<BR>
lorobenzens in flue gas were reduced to about 30% and chlorophenols in flue<BR>
gas were reduced to 50% when Ca/Cl2 ratio was 3. NO concentration in flue<BR>
gas became higher by CaCO3 addition.<BR>
        (2) Ammonium injection: NO concentration in flue gas was reduced to<BR>
70% when NH3/NO ratio was 1. Chlorobenzens were reduced to about 50% when<BR>
NH3/NO ratio was 3, and reduced to 30% when NH3/NO ratio was 5.<BR>
        This study also evaluated the simultaneous measuring method of HCl<BR>
and SOx by the ion chromatography. With this method we could measure more<BR>
quickly than and as precise as the methods stipulated by JIS.<BR>

<TITLE>RESEARCH SECTION FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE
MANAGEMENT, RESEARCH REACTOR INSTITUTE,
KYOTO UNIVERSITY</TITLE>


<H2>Project</H2>

<H3>I. Research on Treatment and Disposal of Radioactive Waste</H3>

Land storage is, for the present, one of the most realistic alternatives for radioactive waste disposal. In an effort to ensure safe land storage of radioactive waste, 
investigations have been conducted in the field and laboratory on the distribution of radioactive cations such as Cobalt-60 and Strontium-90 in clay minerals. One result of this research is the ability to predict the behavior of radionuclides in the ground.


<H3>II. Technical Aspects of Radioactive Waste Treatment Facilities</H3>

Management of radioactive waste requires development of a complex system having technical, economic and social aspects. A systems approach has been examined as a means of 
addressing the development and management of these systems. In addition to the systems 
approach, data from practical experience has been collected on the management of 
radioactive wastes from the KUR (Kyoto University Reactor).


<H3>III. Studies on Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment by Reverse Osmosis</H3>

Reverse osmosis is a simple process and has a relatively high decontamination factor 
in comparison with other processes used for the treatment of radioactive liquid wastes. Permeate properties of various elements are being studied experimentally using 
radionuclides such as Strontium-90, Cobalt-s8, Manganese-s4 and Caesium-134 which are 
representative radionuclides contained in radioactive liquid wastes.

Project Management </H4><P>Several groups are involved in SHEBA planning and coordination.  These groups are briefly described below.</P><P>The SHEBA Science Working Group (SWG) was established in April 1993, under the auspices of the NSF ARCSS  OAII Science Steering Group.  The SHEBA SWG is charged with coordination of SHEBA science activities and planning.  The members of the SWG were chosen for their representation of relevant disciplines, major institutions participating in SHEBA, and related programs.  There are currently 20 members of the SHEBA SWG.</P><P>The SHEBA Interagency Group (IAG) is an<I> ad hoc </I>association of program managers from the member agencies of the Interagency Arctic Research Program Coordination (IARPC).  The IAG coordinates SHEBA funding and interagency coordination of SHEBA activities among NSF, DOE, ONR, and NASA.  In particular, close coordination has developed among SHEBA, the DOE ARM, and the NASA FIRE III programs.  Details on the collaboration of these programs are provided in Appendix A.</P> <P>Coordination of international activities related to SHEBA is conducted under the auspices of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Arctic Climate System Study (ACSYS). International participants in SHEBA planning include scientists from Canada, Russia, Germany, and Norway. </P><P>The SHEBA Project Office has been funded by the NSF ARCSS Program.  The Project Office is charged with assisting the SWG and SHEBA PI's in their activities by organizing meetings and workshops, printing and distributing SHEBA documents and information, coordinating data archival, and coordinating logistics information. </P><P>The selection of PI's and science projects to participate in SHEBA will occur through a competitive process involving the submission, review and evaluation of research proposals submitted in response to a sequence of Announcements of Opportunity published by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the U.S. Office of Naval Research and other federal agencies.</P><P>In outline, SHEBA activities will  proceed according to the following schedule:</P><UL><LI> 1994:  Planning  <LI> 1995:  Technology development, analysis of existing datasets, modeling, satellite studies and logistics planning<LI> 1996:  Continuation of FY 1995 activities; PI's prepare for main experiment  <LI> 1997:  Field experiment <LI> 1998:  Field experiment, initial analysis and interpretation of field data <LI> 1999:  Continue data interpretation and modeling <LI> 2000:  Begin extension to larger scales</UL><P>The scientific rationale for SHEBA is developed in the SHEBA Prospectus, available from the SHEBA Project Office.

Data Management and Distribution</H4><P>The development and maintenance of a comprehensive and accurate data archive is essential to SHEBA.  Because SHEBA is designed as a multi-agency sponsored, multi-disciplinary program with many investigators and varied instrumentation, an integrated data management activity is central to providing a consistent database that is easily accessible.  The overall SHEBA data management philosophy is to make the completed dataset available to the world research community as soon as possible to improve the understanding of Arctic climate and its treatment in global models.</P><P>The SHEBA SWG has formulated the following data protocols:</P><OL><LI> Ensure open access to all SHEBA datasets.  This requires a data management strategy that facilitates data exchange and investigators taking responsibility for making data available.<LI> SHEBA will take advantage of several existing data processing and archive centers to house the variety of datasets to be collected.  These include the  NSIDC, NCAR, NASA/LaRC/DAAC, and ARM/ORNL. Cooperative agreements for unrestricted exchange and access of SHEBA data from all these locations will be established.<LI> All investigators participating in SHEBA must agree to promptly (within one years of the end of the project) submit data to the appropriate data center to facilitate the data processing, archival, and distribution.  Datasets must be submitted to the archive in a useable format and with sufficient documentation to allow easy access and understanding by others.<LI> The SHEBA Project Office has overall responsibility for developing and implementing an integrated data management strategy and coordination with other data centers.</OL><P>SHEBA data processing, quality control, validation, archival and dissemination functions will be distributed among many sites and be the responsibility of several investigators, depending on the types and sources of data.  The overall coordination of data management issues will be the responsibility of the SHEBA Project Office</P>  <P>During the field experiment and the period shortly following its completion, the following data management activities will be required:</P><UL><LI> on-line SHEBA catalog during the field program<LI> near real-time, on-line access to limited data sets for monitoring instrument performance and intercomparisons, and evaluating completeness of datasets<LI> a "living archive" of operational and research datasets for preliminary analysis and evaluating budget determinations by SHEBA PIs during the field experiment<LI> special processing and quality control of specific datasets (field research and operational) to enhance data integration and analysis<LI> final datasets to NSIDC and other data centers for archival.</UL><P>The SHEBA Project Office is now gathering a list from the SHEBA investigators concerning needs and requirements for special integrated or composite datasets to address different important facets of SHEBA.  For example, a special dataset for atmospheric boundary layer modelers could be prepared, synthesizing relevant aircraft, surfaced-based and satellite observations that would be useful to model initialization and validation.  Similar derived datasets addressing the mixed-layer ocean and ice-mass balance issues will be considered.</P><P>SHEBA will take advantage of existing data archives for both project related and important ancillary datasets.  These archives and their relationship to SHEBA are described below.<P><OL><LI> The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) is the archive for all ARCSS datasets.  NSIDC will eventually archive most of the SHEBA data or have links to the other archives.<LI> The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) will archive NCAR aircraft data and a variety of global model output important to SHEBA goals.<LI> The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) houses the long-term ARM data archive.  A cooperative agreement between SHEBA and ARM is being developed to assure easy access to both ARM and SHEBA datasets by all SHEBA participants.<LI> The NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) Data Analysis and Archive Center (DAAC) archives all FIRE data.  SHEBA PIs will have access to all FIRE data obtained during the SHEBA experiment.</OL>

<body bgcolor="FFFFFF"><A NAME="motivation"><A HREF="home.htm#table">Return to Table of Contents</A></A><H4 align=center> 1. Motivation</H4><P>As established in the SHEBA Prospectus, intensified research efforts to elucidate the key physical processes and feedbacks occurring in the arctic climate system are motivated by: </P><UL><LI>questions about possible amplification of climate change in the Arctic and disagreement between models and observations<LI>questions concerning the stability of the arctic ice pack<LI>lack of accurate representation of the present-day arctic climate by Global Climate Models (GCMs), and the variations in arctic climate predictions between different models<LI>lack of <I>in situ </I>data to evaluate and improve satellite retrievals and GCM performance.</UL><P>Numerous experiments performed with climate models support two important conclusions:</P><OL><LI>Interactions among sea ice, the upper ocean, radiation, and clouds in the Arctic exert a strong influence on the modeled global climate and climate sensitivity.  The overall effects of the most important sets of interactions may be characterized as the "ice-albedo feedback" and the "cloud-radiation feedback" mechanisms.<LI>Differences in the formulations of interactive air-sea-ice processes and the associated feedback mechanisms result in large differences between the arctic and global climates simulated by different models.   These differences exist because of uncertainties about the coupling among ocean, ice and atmosphere in the Arctic.</OL><P>Assessment of the sign and magnitude of the ice-albedo and cloud-radiation feedbacks and elucidation of these feedback mechanisms are required to understand and predict the local and regional arctic response to climate perturbations, and its global impact.  These climate feedback mechanisms are the net result of numerous individual physical processes, interacting over a spectrum of time scales.  Climate feedbacks cannot be observed directly; they can only be inferred from carefully designed model experiments.  Successful determination of climate feedbacks, and the interactions among them, can be investigated using models that represent the individual physical processes whose cumulative interactions determine the climate feedback. Our present understanding of these feedback processes occurring in the Arctic is summarized below.<P><P>A common hypothesis is that when  climate warms, snow and ice cover will decrease, leading to a decrease in high-latitude surface albedo and an  increase in the absorption of solar radiation at the surface, which would reinforce the warming. The same mechanism would work in reverse as climate cools.  This climate feedback mechanism is referred to as the "snow/ice-albedo" feedback and is a positive feedback mechanism.  This feedback mechanism involves a range of internal processes occurring within the multiyear ice pack.  Preliminary modeling studies indicate that the magnitude of the positive ice albedo feedback is increased by the inclusion of melt ponds and lateral melting of leads, but diminished by the inclusion of ice thickness distribution, ridging and ice/ocean interactions.</P><P>A second hypothesized feedback is the cloud-radiation feedback.  Several factors affect the cloud-radiation feedback, including cloud morphology, temperature, liquid and ice water content, particle size, and phase.  Each may operate independently or with other factors to constitute a feedback loop.  For example, global warming might change cloud morphology so as to further modify surface temperature.  Also, a cloud-water content feedback arises if adiabatic processes dominate so as to increase water content with increasing atmospheric temperature. Atmospheric aerosols interact with the cloud-radiation feedback via their influence on cloud condensation and freezing nucleation processes.  Available analyses have shown that clouds have an overall warming effect on the surface in the Arctic, which is contrary to the cooling effect that clouds have on the surface at lower latitudes.  Links also exist between the cloud-radiation feedback and the water vapor and temperature lapse rate feedbacks, both of which are thought to be positive in the Arctic.</P><P>Present estimates indicate that the ice-albedo and cloud-radiation climate feedbacks in the Arctic are positive.  If this is correct, it remains a major task in climate modeling to explain the relative stability of the Arctic climate in the presence of these positive feedbacks</P><P>The motivation to improve understanding of how these feedback processes affect the arctic climate, and ultimately the global climate, provides the stimulus for the SHEBA program.  This motivation is shared by the FIRE III and ARM programs, which are closely coordinated with SHEBA to address these feedback processes in arctic climate. The remainder of the document presents a plan for SHEBA to address these issues in arctic climate.</P>

Objectives</H4><P>The SHEBA program is based on the premise that improved understanding of the physical processes involved in air-sea-ice interactions is needed to address the issues of climate feedback in the Arctic and to improve our ability to model the arctic climate.   In this context, three specific programmatic objectives have been established for SHEBA:</P><OL><LI> Observe, over an annual cycle, the components of the surface energy budget and the co-evolution of the upper ocean, sea ice and atmosphere at spatial scales ranging from meters (the scale of an individual ice site) to 100 km (the scale of a GCM grid cell).<LI>Use these observations to develop and evaluate satellite remote sensing techniques, and use remotely-sensed data in the construction of basin-scale data sets.<LI>Develop process models that describe the energy exchanges and the coupled evolution of the ice-atmosphere-ocean system, parameterize these processes in a manner suitable for inclusion in climate models, and investigate the role of these processes in the arctic climate system.</OL><P>These programmatic objectives lay the foundation for improving the treatment of arctic climate processes in global climate models and for improving the observational data base in the Arctic, particularly using satellites.</P><P>Accomplishment of the SHEBA objectives requires that physical processes be observed and modeled so that we can understand and predict:</P><UL><LI>the atmospheric and surface radiation environment and how it is determined by atmospheric constituents and sea ice/ocean optical properties<LI>the physical, chemical and dynamical processes responsible for determining the arctic cloud properties<LI>variations of the surface energy budget components and how they are influenced by the ice thickness distribution, surface characteristics, and variations in cloud properties<LI>the mass balance of the sea-ice and snow cover, in response to the forcing imposed by the atmosphere<LI>the disposition of shortwave radiation in the sea ice and upper ocean<LI>the heat balance of the ocean mixed layer and processes that determine sea ice-upper ocean coupling.</UL>

PARKINSON AND PER GLOERSEN</font><P></center><B>Conclusions</B><P>Satellite passive microwave data are allowing an improved knowledge of sea ice distributions, including their seasonal, regional, and inter-annual variabilities, and an improved understanding of the role of sea ice in the global climate system. Such data have provided the ability to determine global sea ice distributions and approximate ice concentrations on a routine basis, with a frequency of every few days and a spatial resolution of approximately 30 km. Thus the seasonal cycle and inter-annual variations in the sea ice cover can be examined even in regions with no in situ observations, and changes in the sea ice cover can be monitored easily. Furthermore, the large-scale passive microwave data are complemented by much finer resolution data from visible, infra-red, and active microwave sensors, which can be used both to validate the passive microwave data and to examine individual regions in much greater detail. Although the global sea ice record is still too short for a long-term climatological data base, such a data base will eventually become possible as the satellite passive microwave record is extended. Now that the basic technology is developed and its value proven, it is hoped that satellite passive microwave instruments will be maintained indefinitely into the future.<P>	The four-year ESMR data set, averaged over both three-day and monthly time periods, and the nine-year SMMR data set can be obtained in digital form from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado. SSMI data are being compiled and routinely added to the NSIDC archives as well. As passive microwave data are collected in the late 1990s and beyond from the Earth Observing System (EOS), these will be available from the EOS data and information system (EOSDIS).<P><centeR><B><a href="Algor.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="Index.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Ref.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a><P></b></center><BR><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P></body></html>

When combined with the observations obtained at the ice camp and from satellite, the aircraft observations will comprise the primary dataset for interpreting the physical, chemical and dynamical processes responsible for determining the arctic cloud properties. The following questions will be addressed in these campaigns: </P><UL><LI> What are the shortwave radiative effects of the horizontally inhomogeneous stratocumulus clouds over the horizontally inhomogeneous, highly-reflecting snow/ice surface?<LI> What is the influence of leads on cloud properties when there is a large surface temperature contrast with the ice?<LI> What are the mechanisms that lead to the multiple-layering of Arctic Ocean summer clouds?<LI> What are the effects of springtime "Arctic haze" on the optical  properties of polar clouds?<LI> How do the reflectance and transmittance of the clouds and the surface depend on the low solar elevations typical of the Arctic?<LI> How does the transition of low clouds from liquid to crystalline depend on temperature and aerosol characteristics?<LI> What is the role of freezing of sulfuric acid and subsequent growth and fallout in the evolution of "diamond dust"?<LI> Does the formation of "diamond dust" differ in polluted versus unpolluted atmospheres?</UL><P>The modeling strategies that will be used (in collaboration with FIRE III and ARM) to investigate the processes occurring in the arctic cloudy boundary layer include:</P><UL><LI> 1-D second-order closure models with bulk microphysics and radiative transfer<LI> high-resolution 2-D models for the simulation of the lead-induced convective boundary layer<LI> 3-D large-eddy simulation (LES) models that include bulk treatments of radiative transfer and cloud microphysics, or explicit treatment of the cloud microphysical properties and aerosols.</UL><P>Results from the more complex cloudy boundary layer models can be used to develop parameterizations of turbulence and cloud microphysical properties for models of lower complexity, eventually providing a 1-D parameterization that is suitable for incorporation into regional and global models.<P><P>One of the goals of the cloudy boundary campaigns is to assemble a complete dataset for each of several different cloudy boundary layer situations for use in the GEWEX GCSS (Global Cloud System Study) Boundary Layer Cloud model intercomparisons.  This dataset will include mean profiles of temperature, humidity, winds, cloud water content and cloud phase and particle size distribution; advection of these same quantities; profiles of radiative fluxes; and fluxes and covariances of velocity, temperature, and humidity quantities.  These quantities will be used to initialize and evaluate the models.</P><P>The timing of the aircraft campaigns is designed to address critical physical properties and processes that are currently simulated poorly in models and interpreted ambiguously from satellite.  Additional considerations include timing aircraft campaigns to coordinate with other applications of the aircraft (e.g. surveys of the ice, preparation of datasets for the single-column modeling experiments).  Three aircraft campaigns are planned to provide data on the cloudy boundary layer. </P><OL><LI> Mid-April through mid-June (in collaboration with FIRE III).  The primary motivation of this campaign is to sample the seasonal transition period between ice crystal clouds and water phase clouds, and how this is influenced by atmospheric chemistry. <LI> August. During August the summertime stratus regime is fully developed and the boundary layer is relatively turbulent and complex,  with multiple-layered boundary layer clouds. <LI> February. The low-level wintertime clouds are predominantly crystalline at this time and there is an abundance of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. The  physical processes associated with the dehydration-radiation feedback hypothesis will be examined.  During the winter aircraft campaign, we will also sample the lead-induced convective boundary layer. </OL><P>We anticipate the use of the following aircraft during the SHEBA campaigns, which represent the minimum requirements to achieve the scientific objectives.  Participation of additional aircraft, particularly from foreign collaborators, will be sought:</P><OL><LI> a high-altitude aircraft, to carry  downward looking lidar/radar and prototypes of current and future satellite sensors <LI> a long-range  aircraft  that  is instrumented to measure high-frequency winds, temperature and humidity variations; in situ cloud microphysical and atmospheric chemistry characteristics; and radiative transfer. <LI> low-altitude aircraft that is instrumented with specialized atmospheric chemistry, cloud  physics  and  radiation  instrumentation.</OL><P>To address the issues related to physical and chemical processes in clouds, modeling and satellite remote sensing, the following measurements from aircraft are needed to supplement the surface-based measurements: </P><UL><LI> cloud microphysical characteristics (liquid and ice water contents, discrimination of phase in mixed-phase clouds, particle size distributions, ice crystal habits)<LI> radiation characteristics (broad-band fluxes, multi-spectral and multi-angle radiances, direct and diffuse radiation, scattering phase function of clouds)<LI> aerosol characteristics (aerosol size distribution and composition, cloud condensation nuclei, ice forming nuclei)<LI> meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, and vector winds)<LI> turbulence quantities (variances and covariances of temperature, humidity and velocities)<LI> scanning radiometers to assess cloud properties and ice surface characteristics</UL> <P>Technical difficulties associated with aircraft observations of the arctic environment that must be overcome with improved instrumentation include: icing and wetting of sensors, microphysical measurements in mixed-phase clouds, and turbulence measurements in the stable boundary layer.

The submarine has proven to be an ideal platform for basin-wide surveys of oceanographic conditions.  In conjunction with the SCICEX Program, cruises are planned for spring and fall of 1997, and spring of 1998.  Each cruise will provide a synoptic view of the ice thickness distribution and the horizontal variability of upper ocean properties.</P><P>Once satellite retrieval schemes have been improved using the combination of base camp and aircraft  observations, satellites  can provide observations on the scale of the Arctic Ocean basin of cloud properties, top-of-the-atmosphere and surface radiation fluxes, ice characteristics, surface temperature and albedo, atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles, and ozone abundance.</P><P>An analysis/assimilation system, such as that operated by the numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers, essentially interpolates "asynoptic" data and produces a gridded contemporaneous product.  SHEBA should work with the major NWP centers to obtain a high-resolution research-quality analysis of the Arctic Ocean for the SHEBA year.  An intriguing possibility is the utilization of a mesoscale model to do high-resolution analyses over the Arctic Ocean, assimilating non-traditional satellite and in situ measurements.  The Navy Model was used for this purpose during LEADEX.   A version of the Arctic Regional Climate System Model (ARCSyM) could also be used for this purpose.  A final product of SHEBA should be the incorporation of ice camp and satellite data into a 4-D assimilation model that has improved parameterizations of clouds, radiation, atmospheric boundary layer, and sea ice-upper ocean.</P><P>In view of the SHEBA objectives, the analysis of surface fluxes is of particular importance.  It is desirable to provide daily values over an annual cycle of all components of the surfaces fluxes of heat, fresh water, and momentum on a horizontal scale of 100 km.  This will be accomplished through a synthesis of in situ buoy data, satellite retrievals, and  analyses made using a mesoscale model (such as a version of ARCSyM).  It is noted here that such an analysis addresses directly a major component of the ACSYS Atmospheric Programme as described in the ACSYS Initial Implementation Plan.</P> <P>In the context of SHEBA and in collaboration with other programs, a coupled regional climate model for the Arctic Ocean basin will be developed, in coordination with the ARCSyM.  A major application of this model will be to describe realistically the annual cycle observed during the SHEBA field experiment. A regional model of the arctic coupled climate system can be used for 4-D data assimilation as well as for exploration of coupled model sensitivities and feedbacks and development of suitable parameterizations for global coupled models. This regional coupled model will provide the interdisciplinary integration of SHEBA.</P><P>Development of model parameterizations will proceed from the single-column modeling experiments and the variety of physical process models.  Modeling difficulties are compounded considerably by coupling two or more sub-systems.  The coupling of imperfect models (e.g. atmosphere and sea ice) invariably results in serious model drift.  Problems that are relatively minor when modeling an individual system may be amplified in a coupled model with nonlinear feedbacks.  This coupling in the context of climate modeling highlights the ice-atmosphere and ice-ocean interfacial fluxes, which is a primary focus of SHEBA.  Of particular importance is the development of a parameterization of surface heat and moisture flux from leads, as a function of modeled or observed lead fraction and the observed or parameterized lead width distribution.</P><P>A major product of the regional climate modeling effort will be improved parameterizations that have been tested in a coupled model, and can be incorporated into global climate models.  We anticipate that a major contribution of SHEBA will be an improved 3-D sea ice model that incorporates the thermodynamic processes and couplings associated with the ice thickness distribution into a dynamical sea ice model.</P>

In particular,  we would like to have data on spatial and temporal variations in ice concentration, thin ice amounts, pond coverage, snow distribution, surface albedo, and floe size within 50-100 km of the ice camp to address the following issue:  </P><UL><LI>What is the role of spatial variations in ice thickness and ice type on large-scale interactions between ice, ocean and atmosphere?</UL><P>These data are also required for the Single-Column GCM experiments (section 5.1).  To describe accurately the statistical characteristics of the  surface ice features, aircraft observations are needed.   Two types of aircraft will be used:  a helicopter equipped with a video camera and radiometers, and a long-range research aircraft equipped with scanning radiometers that measure at visible, near-infrared, thermal, and microwave wavelengths.  When flown at low altitudes below clouds, the aircraft remote sensing instruments can resolve ice surface characteristics occurring on horizontal scales of a few meters to a few tens of meters (depending on sensor and wavelength).  A helicopter based at the ice camp will be required for frequent surveys of pond characteristics during the summer melt season.  The aircraft will be used (in conjunction with the cloudy boundary layer campaigns) to extend this coverage to larger areas and take advantage of more sophisticated remote sensing instruments on the aircraft.</P><P>The high-resolution aircraft scanning radiometers will be used to determine the fractional coverage of open water, thin ice, first-year ice, second-year ice and multi-year ice and the associated distribution of surface temperatures and albedos. Lead width distribution can be determined by examining the small-scale spatial structure of leads encountered by the scanning radiometer.  The size distribution of widths of open leads and refrozen leads can be determined over the regions covered by the scanning radiometer along the flight tracks.  Melt ponds that exceed a size of 10 m can be resolved using the scanning radiometers at low flight altitudes.</P><P>A research-oriented submarine cruise in the vicinity of the SHEBA camp would provide an estimate of the ice thickness distribution and open lead areas.  In conjunction with the ONR Science Submarine Program, cruise profiles are planned with SHEBA science objectives in spring and fall of 1997 and spring 1998.  Each cruise could provide two or more "snapshot" surveys of the sea ice draft distribution in the SHEBA area.</P><P>Estimates of the time series of ice divergence in the vicinity of the ice camp are required to interpret the lead fraction and the ice thickness distribution.  In conjunction with the mesoscale ocean buoy clusters, there will be an equilateral triangle of ice buoys separated by 100 km.  The surface ice velocity and ice deformation fields can be determined using GPS control points in the mesoscale array and RADARSAT data.</P>

PARKINSON AND PER GLOERSEN</font><P></center><B>Methodology</B><P>The large contrast in the microwave emissivities of sea ice and liquid water is the crucial factor making satellite passive microwave measurements so valuable for sea ice studies. With a single channel of microwave information, as from the Nimbus-5 ESMR, approximate sea ice concentrations can be calculated in locations where the ice and water emissivities can realistically be accepted as constants, by assuming a linear relationship between the observed microwave brightness temperature, T<font size="-2"><i>B</i> </font>, and the brightness temperatures of the ice and water. ('Brightness temperature' is a variable frequently used to represent the intensity of microwave radiation thermally emitted by an object. It is given in units of temperature, made appropriate because of the approximate proportionality between emitted radiation at microwave wavelengths and the physical temperature of the radiating layer.) Labeling the ice and water emissivities as   <img src="images/Ei.jpg" align=top>   and   <img src="images/Ew.jpg" align=top>  and the physical temperatures of the ice and water as T<font size="-2">I</font> and T<font size=-2>W</font>, then the respective brightness temperatures are   <img src="images/EiTi.jpg" align=top>   and   <img src="images/EwTw.jpg" align=top>, and the approximate ice concentration, C, is:<P><center><img src="images/equat1.jpg"></center><P>In the case of horizontally polarized radiation at a wavelength of 1.55 cm, as received and transmitted by the ESMR, a constant value of 0.44 is appropriate for   <img src="images/Ew.jpg" align=top>  in Equation 1. However,   <img src="images/Ei.jpg" align=top>  varies with such conditions as the age of the ice, its surface salinity, and its air and liquid-water contents. In much of the Southern Ocean and many of the peripheral seas of the Arctic, sea ice is predominantly first-year ice and has an emissivity of approximately 0.92. In such locations, Equation 1 can be used to calculate ice concentrations from the ESMR data, with <img src="images/Ew.jpg" align=top> and <img src="images/Ei.jpg" align=top> set at 0.44 and 0.92, respectively. In the central Arctic Ocean, on the other hand, much of the multiyear ice has a lower microwave emissivity, due in part to radiation scattering within air pockets remaining after brine drainage has occurred in the freeboard layer of the ice during the summer melt season. This complicates the determination of ice concentrations from the single-channel ESMR data in regions with a mixture of ice types (Campbell <I>et al.</i> , 1976) and leaves an ambiguity in the determination of ice concentrations (see Carsey (1982) and Parkinson <I>et al.</i>  (1987) for details).<P>	To adjust for this ambiguity in the presence of a mixture of ice types, the single variable ice concentration scale used in mapping ice concentrations in regions with predominantly one ice typo is replaced by a nomogram incorporating both ice concentration and multiyear ice fraction. In the nomogram, a sample of which is given in the following section <a href="Fig5.htm">(see Fig. 5)</a>, the scale on the horizontal axis is for the fraction of multiyear ice, while lines of equal total ice concentration slope downward across the face of the nomogram, reflecting the fact that as the fraction of multiyear ice increases, a given brightness temperature will correspond to a higher total ice concentration (because the emissivity of multiyear ice is closer to that of open water than the emissivity of first-year ice is). For a known fraction of multiyear ice, the nomogram associates with each color a range of total ice concentrations covering about 4%, as in the case of the corresponding single variable ice concentration scales (e.g., see Figs. <a href="Fig4.htm">4</a>, <a href="Fig7.htm">7</a>, <a href="Fig8.htm">8</a>). However, when the fraction of multiyear ice is unknown, then the range in ice concentration values associated with a given color can be greatly increased. For example, referring to the nomogram in <a href="Fig5.htm">Fig. 5</a> in the next section, deep green signifies total ice concentrations ranging anywhere from 44% for regions of no multiyear ice to 58% for regions where all the ice is multiyear ice. This shows the effect that the ambiguity produced by having a mixture of ice types has on increasing the error bars for the ice concentrations calculated from the ESMR data.<P>	The ambiguities inherent in calculating sea ice concentrations with single-channel data can be reduced or even eliminated by using multi-channel data and appropriate geophysical algorithms. Cavalieri <I>et al.</i>  (1984) and Gloersen and Cavalieri (1986) have used the 0.81 and 1.7 cm channels of the SMMR to calculate total ice concentrations and multiyear ice concentrations based on the following polarization ratio (PR) and spectral gradient ratio (GR):<P><center><img src="images/equat2.jpg"><P><img src="images/equat3.jpg"></center><P>where  (TB(V,<img src="images/lambda.jpg" align=top>)  and   (TB(H,<img src="images/lambda.jpg" align=top>)   are the brightness temperatures at wavelength   <img src="images/lambda.jpg" align=top>(given in centimeters in Equations 2 and 3) for vertically and horizontally polarized radiation, respectively. The PR values for water significantly exceed those for ice; and in wintertime GR is distinctly positive for water, negative for multiyear ice, and near zero (slightly negative) for first-year ice. These contrasts allow the calculation of ice concentrations C and wintertime multiyear ice concentrations CM, as detailed in Gloersen <I>et al.</i>  (1992). The results for the Northern Hemisphere are:<P><center><img src="images/equat4.jpg"><P><img src="images/equat5.jpg"></center><P>The multiyear ice calculations produce meaningful values only when the ice surface is dry, as a wet surface obscures the first-year/multiyear contrast. Thus the multiyear ice calculations are not reliable during summer or at anytime near the seaward ice edge. In the case of the Southern Hemisphere, because of the limited amount of ice that experiences summer melt and then survives into the winter with the microwave signatures typical of Arctic multiyear ice, multiyear ice concentrations are generally not calculated. However, the same GR/PR-based algorithm is used in the calculation of total ice concentrations, although with coefficients corresponding to 'Type A' and 'Type B' ice, terms left intentionally ambiguous to avoid, in the absence of appropriate <I>in situ</i> data, identifying them explicitly with specific geophysical ice types. The labels 'Type A' and 'Type B' are meant simply to refer to two types of ice in the Southern Ocean with distinctly different microwave signatures. The formulations for total ice concentrations, C, and Type B ice concentrations, CB, for the Antarctic are:<P>	<center><img src="images/equat6.jpg"><P><img src="images/equat7.jpg"></center><P><a href="Fig3.htm">Fig. 3</a> presents plots of the relationship between GR, PR, and the total and multiyear ice concentrations for the Arctic and the relationship between GR, PR, and the total and Type B ice concentrations for the Antarctic.<P>	Alternative algorithms for the calculation of ice concentrations from the multi-channel SMMR data also exist (e.g. Svendsen <I>et al.</i> , 1983; Swift, Fedor & Ramseier, 1985; Comiso, 1986), but the Cavalieri <I>et al.</i>  (1984) algorithm has been widely applied and is the one used, in the revised form of Equations 2-7, to generate the SMMR ice concentration images for the SMMR sea ice atlas of Gloersen <I>et al.</i>  (1992) and for Figs. <a href="Fig4.htm">4</a>, <a href="Fig6.htm">6</a>, and <a href="Fig7.htm">7</a> in the next section.<P><center><B><a href="Intro.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="Index.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Anal.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a> <P></b></center><BR><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P></body></html>

PARKINSON, JOSEFINO C. COMISO, H. JAY ZWALLY,<BR> DONALD J. CAVALIERI, PER GLOERSEN, WILLIAM J. CAMPBELL</FONT></center><P><BR><B>Arctic sea ice distributions</B><P>The passive microwave data reveal that sea ice extent in the Northern Hemisphere typically ranges from a minimum of approximately 8 million square kilometers in September to a maximum of approximately 15 x 10 million square kilometers in March (Parkinson & Cavalieri, 1989). In September ice covers much of the central Arctic Ocean and portions of the Canadian Archipelago and the Greenland Sea. By the end of October ice covers almost the entire Arctic Ocean and Canadian Archipelago, and extends well south along the east coast of Greenland. The ice cover expands rapidly during the next two months, with most of Baffin Bay and the Kara Sea ice covered by the end of November, and Hudson Bay and the northern Bering Sea ice covered by the end of December. Expansion continues at a slower rate in January and February, with the ice by the March maximum generally covering almost the entire Arctic Ocean, Canadian Archipelago, Kara Sea, Baffin Bay, and Hudson Bay, plus large portions of the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, Greenland Sea, Davis Strait, and Barents Sea. Retreat generally proceeds slowly in March and April, when it tends to be most pronounced in the Sea of Okhotsk. By mid-May noticeable retreat has also occurred in the Bering Sea and at the open-water ice edge in the North Atlantic vicinity. By mid-June major openings appear in the ice cover of the remaining regions, and by mid-July most of the ice of Hudson Bay, Davis Strait, and Baffin Bay has disappeared. By August the ice cover is close to its September minimum, with significant coastal openings around much of the Arctic Ocean and little or no ice remaining in most of the peripheral seas and bays. <a href="Fig4.htm">Fig. 4</a> shows the seasonal cycle of the sea ice cover in the Northern Hemisphere for 1985, a fairly typical year in the 1970s and 1980s.<P>	The strong spatial asymmetry in the wintertime sea ice cover <a href="Fig4.htm">(Fig. 4)</a> is caused by a variety of geographic, oceanographic, and atmospheric factors, a fact that can be illustrated by the contrasting cases of Hudson Bay and the southern Barents Sea. Hudson Bay tends to be fully ice covered in winter in spite of being situated in lower latitudes (52-65 degrees N) than many regions that are free of ice throughout the year. This is in large part due to the positioning of Hudson Bay in the midst of the North American continent, making it subject to colder winters and warmer summers than oceanic regions at the same latitudes, and to the fact that its openings to warmer waters are very limited. In contrast, the southern Barents Sea tends to remain free of ice even in the midst of winter <a href="Fig4.htm">(Fig. 4)</a> in spite of its high latitudes (70-75 degrees N). This results largely from the warm water advected into the Barents Sea by the north-flowing Norwegian Current.<P>	The Northern Hemisphere ice cover exhibits prominent inter-annual variations in each month, and these are illustrated in <a href="Fig5.htm">Fig. 5</a> with February and September ice concentration images for 1973 and 1974. A few highlights of specific examples of the inter-annual differences visible in <a href="Fig5.htm">Fig. 5</a> will be mentioned, although others are clearly visible as well. In February 1973 sea ice covered almost the entire Sea of Okhotsk, whereas in February 1974 only half the sea was ice covered; and in February 1973 a large extension of ice occurred eastward from the main ice field of the Greenland Sea, whereas this extension did not exist in February 1974. In contrast, February ice coverage in the Bering Sea was greater in 1974 than in 1973. For analysis of the inter-annual contrasts in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea and comparison with atmospheric pressure fields, the reader is referred to Parkinson (1990) and Cavalieri and Parkinson (1987). Many other inter-annual differences in both the ice distributions and the ice concentrations are apparent from the two February images of <a href="Fig5.htm">Fig. 5</a>, as are noticeable inter-annual consistencies, such as the full ice coverage in Hudson Bay, the absence of ice in most of the Barents Sea, and the extension of ice along the entire east coast of Greenland <a href="Fig5.htm">(Fig. 5)</a>.<P>	The September images of <a href="Fig5.htm">Fig. 5</a> show inter-annual differences in late summer that are comparable to the winter inter-annual differences shown in the February images. For instance, the ice had retreated far more from the northeast coast of Alaska in September 1973 than in September 1974 but far less from the northeast coast of Siberia. Among the consistencies in the Septembers of these two years is the persistence of ice along the north coasts of Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago and along the northern half of the east coast of Greenland <a href="Fig5.htm">(Fig. 5)</a>.<P>	Because the SMMR data have been used to calculate wintertime multiyear ice concentrations as well as total ice concentrations, a sample multiyear ice concentration image is included for March 1985 <a href="Fig6.htm">(Fig. 6)</a>. The March 1985 image shows high multiyear ice concentrations north of Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago, where the ice cover is known to be frequently highly concentrated and ridged (Bourke & Garrett, 1987). Although the multiyear ice concentrations have larger error bars than the total ice concentrations and have been less thoroughly validated with in situ data, the possibility of routinely determining multiyear ice coverage from the multi-channel SMMR and SSMI data is considered a major advance over the possibilities available with the single channel ESMR data. In particular, because multiyear ice is quasi-conservative in the Arctic Basin during the winter season, its distribution can be used to infer patterns of ice motion, as done by Zwally and Walsh (1987). In a later study, Walsh and Zwally (1990) compare SMMR multiyear ice concentrations with model calculations, finding the simulated concentrations of multiyear ice to be slightly higher than the SMMR-derived values, although finding good agreement between the simulated and observed total coverage of multiyear ice. Arctic multiyear ice concentration images for all winter months of the SMMR record are included in the SMMR atlas of Gloersen <I>et al.</i>  (1992).<P><center><B><a href="Anal.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="Index.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Antice.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a><P></b></center><BR><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P></body></html>

For instance, it is a strong insulator, restricting exchanges of heat, mass, and momentum between ocean and atmosphere; it has a much higher short-wave albedo than does open water, so that the absorption of solar radiation at the Earth's surface is considerably reduced in the presence of a sea ice cover; and it tends to reject salt during freezing and aging, altering the salinity and density content of the upper ocean. At times, the salt rejection leads to deep convection and bottom water formation, thereby affecting water circulations throughout the oceans. In addition to its importance to the climate system, sea ice also provides a surface for polar animals, obstructs shipping activities, modifies submarine acoustics, and occasionally serves as a platform for oil drilling operations. It is thus a vital constituent of the polar regions <a href="Fig1.htm">(Fig. 1)</a> from many different perspectives. More detail on the varied impacts of the sea ice cover can be found in Barry (1983) and in Parkinson <I>et al.</i>  (1987).<P>The harshness of the polar environment has traditionally made sea ice a very difficult variable for which to obtain consistent long-term data sets. Satellite technology now eliminates the disadvantages of the harsh environment, although some ground observations are still essential for validating and properly interpreting the satellite observations. Satellite data for limited regions have been obtained from visible and near infra-red instruments since the 1960s, often with a resolution allowing the identification and tracking of individual ice floes <a href="Fig2.htm">(e.g. Fig. 2)</a>. These data can be very valuable for detailed regional studies, allowing, for instance, the determination of ice-floe shapes and sizes and the calculation of ice velocities (e.g. DeRycke, 1973; Dey, Moore & Gregory, 1979; Dey, 1981; Ito & Muller, 1982). However, the visible and near infra-red data are limited in their usefulness for large-scale, long-term climate studies because 1) the data have a resolution that, for all practical purposes, is too fine to allow global data coverage, 2) sea ice is obscured in the event of overlying clouds, and 3) the visible data are unobtainable during periods of darkness.<P>	The advent of satellite passive microwave imagery in the early 1970s allowed for the first time the routine monitoring of global sea ice distributions. Although certain important aspects of the ice, such as ice thickness, were and still are unobtainable from satellites, the spatial pattern of sea ice distributions can be determined readily from the passive microwave data because of the significant contrast between the emissivities of sea ice and sea water at microwave wavelengths, sea ice having the higher values. This emissivity contrast allows not only the determination of sea ice distributions but, more quantitatively, the calculation of sea ice concentrations (spatial percentage Overages, in units of percent) and sea ice extents (areas covered by ice, in units of square kilometers). Furthermore, the microwave data are not restricted by darkness or by non-precipitating clouds, so that meaningful data can be obtained for all seasons of the year and all hours of the day. In addition, the data have coarse enough resolution to allow routine global monitoring and yet adequate resolution for identifying major changes in the sea ice cover and performing climate analyses.<P>	The first passive microwave imager successfully launched into space was the Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) on board the Nimbus-5 satellite, launched in December 1972. This single-channel instrument was a crosstrack scanner with incidence angle varying from 0 degrees to 50 degrees, and it recorded horizontally polarized radiation at a wavelength of 1.55 cm. At that wavelength, open water has an emissivity of approximately 0.44 whereas sea ice has much higher emissivities, generally within the range 0.80-0.98. The ESMR data have been used to determine and map global sea ice distributions and concentrations at a grid spacing of approximately 30 km. Although the spatial resolution of the microwave radiances varies significantly depending on the swath position of the instrument scan, ranging from approximately 30 km for data collected at nadir to as high as 100 km for data from the outer beam positions, in general the data used in the calculations are restricted to inner beam positions, yielding resolutions of 30-50 km. An exception comes for the area poleward of 85 degrees latitude, for which data coverage is limited to the outer beam positions and hence those positions are used in the calculations. The ESMR instrument transmitted high-quality data for most of the period 1973-1976, and monthly averages of the resulting data have been analyzed and compiled in two atlases of the sea ice cover, one for the south polar region (Zwally <I>et al.</i> , 1983) and one for the north polar region (Parkinson <I>et al.</i> , 1987).<P>	In October 1978 a more advanced microwave instrument, the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), was launched on board the Nimbus-7 satellite. In contrast to the ESMR, which scanned the surface across the satellite track and had a wide range of incidence angles, the Nimbus-7 SMMR was a conical scanner with a constant incidence angle of 50 degrees. The conical scanner permits the acquisition of both vertically and horizontally polarized data, and indeed the Nimbus-7 SMMR had 10 channels, receiving and transmitting both polarized components at wavelengths of 0.81, 1.4, 1.7, 2.8, and 4.6 cm. The spatial resolution of the data is dependent upon the wavelength and varies from approximately 30 km for the 0.81 cm channels to approximately 150 km for the 4.6 cm channels (Gloersen & Barath, 1977). The multi-channel nature of the SMMR led to reduced error bars for the calculated sea ice concentrations and additionally allowed the determination, for the wintertime ice cover in the Arctic, of the concentrations of two primary ice types: ice that has not undergone a summer melt period, termed Ôfirst-year ice', and ice that has undergone a summer melt period, termed Ômultiyear ice' (Cavalieri, Gloersen & Campbell, 1984). Unfortunately, the Nimbus-7 orbit and the 780 km width of the SMMR swath did not allow SMMR data coverage poleward of about 84.6 degrees latitude, eliminating a 5.4 degrees latitude region in the central Arctic Ocean and an equivalently sized region on the Antarctic continent. Also, the SMMR instrument was generally operated on an every other-day basis, rather than continuously. An atlas presenting monthly averages of sea ice concentrations derived from the SMMR data and analyzing the SMMR sea ice data set has been produced by Gloersen <I>et al.</i>  (1992). The atlas includes Northern and Southern Hemisphere monthly average total ice concentration images for each month November 1978 through August 1987, plus Arctic multiyear ice concentrations for the winter months and, in an appendix, derived monthly average sea ice temperatures for each hemisphere. The ice concentration algorithm, issues of calibration, instrument drift, and validation, and many aspects of the sea ice cover revealed by the SMMR data are all discussed in detail (Gloersen <I>et al.</i> , 1992).<P>SMMR data coverage continued through mid-August 1987, by which time the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) had, in June 1987, launched a special sensor microwave imager (SSMI). The seven-channel DMSP SSMI incorporates the conical scanning design, with a constant incidence angle of 53 degrees. The SSMI measures dual-polarized radiation at wavelengths of 0.35, 0.81, and 1.55 cm and singly polarized radiation at 1.35 cm. The DMSP orbit and the 1394 km swath width of the SSMI allow data coverage everywhere equatorwards of 87.6 degrees north and south latitude. Details on the SSMI instrument can be found in Hollinger <I>et al.</i>  (1987), and a discussion and validation of sea ice concentrations derived from the SSMI data can be found in Cavalieri <I>et al.</i>  (1991). Plans exist for a continuing sequence of DMSP SSMI instruments. Furthermore, a Multi-frequency Imaging Microwave Radiometer (MIMR) is planned for the Earth Observing System near the end of the 1990s. It thus appears likely that passive microwave data coverage of the polar regions will continue on an uninterrupted basis indefinitely into the future, providing a lengthening sea ice data set for climate studies.<P>	Satellite active microwave imaging is also proving extremely valuable for sea ice research. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) emits microwave energy and measures the reflected signal. This active microwave technique shares with passive microwave imaging the advantages of being able to obtain measurements of the Earth's surface through clouds and during periods of darkness. SAR data have much finer resolution than passive microwave data, so that they are less appropriate for routine global coverage but can be used for identifying individual ice floes and carrying out the types of detailed studies also possible with visible and near infra-red imagery, although with the major advantage of not being hindered by cloud or darkness. SAR instruments have flown on NASA's Seasat in 1978, on the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1), launched in 1991, and on the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite aERS-1), launched in 1992. A SAR instrument is also planned for the Canadian Radarsat scheduled for launch in 1995. The Seasat SAR data have been used in several sea ice studies (e.g. Fu & Holt, 1982; Leberl <I>et al.</i> , 1983; Lee & Yang, 1987; Carsey & Pihos, 1989), and plans exist for extensive use of the ERS-1 SAR data, JERS-1 data, and the anticipated Radarsat data. The SAR capabilities and results, however, will not be elaborated here, because of the emphasis in this chapter and book on large-scale, repeated observations appropriate for climate studies. The coarser resolution of the passive microwave data, and the resultant feasibility of routine global monitoring on the order of every few days, makes the passive microwave data much more applicable than the active microwave data for long-term, global studies. Hence the concentration in the remainder of this chapter will be on the passive microwave data and the results obtained from them.<P><center><B><a href="Index.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="Index.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Method.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a><P></b></center><BR><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P></body></html>

PARKINSON AND PER GLOERSEN</font><P></center><B>Antarctic sea ice distributions</B><P>The sea ice cover of the Southern Hemisphere, unconstrained by land along its equatorward perimeter, experiences a seasonal cycle having a much greater amplitude than that of the ice cover in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the ice extent typically ranges from a minimum of approximately 4 x 10 million square kilometers in February, only half the minimum in the Northern Hemisphere, to a maximum of approximately 20 million square kilometers in September, which exceeds by about 5 million square kilometers the maximum in the Northern Hemisphere. In February, the Southern Hemisphere ice is concentrated in the Weddell, Bellingshausen, Amundsen, and eastern Ross seas, with only a narrow fringe of ice existing around most of the rest of the Antarctic continent <a href="Fig7.htm">(Fig. 7)</a>. Late summer expansion of the ice cover is generally most noticeable in the eastern Ross Sea, and early autumn expansion is most noticeable in the entire Ross Sea and the central and eastern Weddell Sea. By May the ice cover has expanded northward to about 65 degrees S in the Ross Sea and around much of the eastern portion of the continent, while lagging somewhat in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas and extending outward to near 60 degrees S in the western Weddell Sea. Growth continues around the continent for the next 3-4 months, although with temporary intervals of decay in individual localities. At maximum ice coverage, the ice surrounds the Antarctic continent and at most longitudes extends equatorward to between 55 degrees and 65 degrees S. At this time, the ice edge is generally farthest north in the eastern Weddell Sea near the Greenwich meridian and farthest south in the western Bellingshausen Sea. Decay of the ice proceeds slowly in early Spring but then very rapidly from October to January. A primary anomaly in the generally southward retreat of the ice edge occurs in the Ross Sea, where a large polynya consistently opens off the coast of the Ross Ice Shelf in November or December and then expands northward, contributing to a local decay of the ice pack from the south to the north. By January the western Ross Sea is nearly free of ice, although considerable ice remains to the east. <a href="Fig7.htm">Fig. 7</a> shows the seasonal cycle of the sea ice cover in the Southern Hemisphere for 1985; full sets of monthly images for the ESMR and SMMR Southern Hemisphere data sets can be found in Zwally <I>et al.</i>  (1983) and in Gloersen <I>et al.</i>  (1992), respectively.<P>	The asymmetry in the typical Antarctic growth/decay cycle, with the spring/summer decay occurring more rapidly (September to February) than the fall/winter growth (February to September), contrasts with the more symmetric growth/ decay cycle typical in the Arctic, where ice extent minima and maxima tend to be about six months apart, occurring in September and March (see previous section). Gordon (1981) suggests that the contrast between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres reflects fundamental differences in the heat budgets of the sea ice in the two regions. In particular, the rapid decay of the Antarctic ice is likely related to significantly greater upwelling of relatively warm deep water than occurs in the Arctic, as the atmosphere-to-ocean heat flux alone appears insufficient to account for the observed rate of melting, especially during the period of most rapid melt, from mid-November to mid-January (Gordon, 1981).<P>	Similarly to the ice in the Northern Hemisphere, the sea ice cover in the Southern Hemisphere experiences noticeable inter-annual variations. These are illustrated in <a href="Fig8.htm">Fig. 8</a> with September ESMR images for each of the four years 1973-1976. One of the most striking inter-annual contrasts apparent in these images is the occurrence at about 0 degrees E and 67 degrees S of a large open water region (the Weddell polynya) in 1974-1976 and its absence in 1973. Over the three winters of its existence, there was a noticeable westward shift in the location of the polynya, accompanied by a change in shape <a href="Fig8.htm">(Fig. 8)</a>. This open water region has been the topic of much discussion in the past two decades (e.g. Gordon, 1978; Carsey, 1980; Martinson, Killworth & Gordon, 1981; Parkinson, 1983; Zwally <I>et al.</i> , 1983; Lemke, 1987; Gordon & Huber, 1990) and highlights not only the inter-annual variability of the sea ice cover but also remaining uncertainties regarding generating mechanisms for major polynyas and the relative importance of oceanic, atmospheric, and internal ice processes. The polynya has not reoccurred since 1976 at even close to the size and duration experienced in 1974-1976.<P><center><B><a href="Arcice.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="Index.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Limit.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a><P></b></center><BR><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P></body></html>

PARKINSON AND PER GLOERSEN</font><P></center><B>Limitations</B><P>There are several important limitations of the satellite passive microwave data for sea ice studies, among the most important being the limitations due to coarse resolution, the limitations due to imperfect algorithms, the limitations due to the specific satellite orbits, and the limitations due to the brevity of the satellite record. Each of these will be discussed in turn.<P><hr size=3 width=52% align=left><P><B>Resolution</B><P>The approximately 30 km spatial resolution of the satellite passive microwave data, although appropriate for climatic and other large-scale studies, is too coarse to allow identification of individual ice floes and hence to track floes or determine floe shapes and sizes. Other satellite data can be used for such determinations, however, and those data, from Landsat, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and other high resolution instruments, can complement the satellite passive microwave record by providing a high degree of detail in select local areas. The reader is referred to Hall and Martinec (1985) for an overview of the uses of these higher resolution data for sea ice studies, as well as an overview of the properties of the sensors. Another problem aggravated by the coarse resolution of the passive microwave data is the issue of land contamination, whereby the ice concentration calculations often lead to a spurious indication of ice in near coastal open water areas because of the existence of land (with high brightness temperatures generally at or above the brightness temperatures of ice and well above the brightness temperatures of open water) within the field of view of the sensor (e.g. see the discussion in Parkinson & Cavalieri, 1989).<P><hr size=3 width=52% align=letf><P> <B>Algorithms</B><P>The algorithms used to convert from the radiances transmitted by the satellite passive microwave sensors to the desired geophysical sea ice parameters entail several simplifications and uncertainties. Snow cover, temperature, moisture, surface salinity, air bubbles, and meltponding all have effects on the microwave emissions of the ice surface and yet generally are not explicitly incorporated in the algorithms. Also, atmospheric constituents and processes alter the amount of microwave radiation received by the satellite, and these are only partially accounted for in the calculations. All such complications can lead to errors in the calculated ice concentrations. Taking all the various uncertainties into consideration, accuracy estimates for the calculated sea ice concentrations are 15-25% for the ESMR data (Zwally <I>et al.</i> , 1983; Parkinson <I>et al.</i> , 1987) and 5-9% for the SMMR data (Cavalieri <I>et al.</i> , 1984; Steffen & Maslanik, 1988). The highest uncertainties (about 25%) for the ESMR data occur in situations with an unknown mixture of first-year and multiyear ice. In the case of multiyear ice concentrations calculated from the SMMR data, the precision is estimated to be 13-25% (Cavalieri <I>et al.</i> , 1984). The algorithm used for calculating ice concentrations from the SSMI data has the same basic formulation as the SMMR algorithm, although with different coefficients. A study recently completed for validating the SSMI data in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas (Cavalieri <I>et al.</i> , 1991) has found good correspondence between sea ice concentrations derived from the satellite passive microwave data and those determined from coincident aircraft data, but less satisfactory results for the multiyear ice concentrations. The SSMI algorithm appears to overestimate multiyear ice concentrations by about 9%, while the mean differences between total ice concentrations obtained from the SSMI and those obtained from the aircraft range from -3% to +5% (Cavalieri <I>et al.</i> , 1991).<P><hr size=3 width=52% align=left><P><B>Orbits</b><P>Although the orbit of the Nimbus-5 satellite allowed global data coverage by the ESMR instrument, the orbits of subsequent satellites carrying passive microwave sensors have instead allowed near-global but not fully global coverage. Due to the orbit of the Nimbus-7 satellite and the swath of the SMMR, there are no data from the Nimbus-7 SMMR for the region poleward of 84.6 degrees latitude. Due to the orbit of the DMSP satellite and the swath of the SSMI, there are no data from the DMSP SSMI for the smaller region poleward of 87.6 degrees latitude. The affected region in the Southern Hemisphere is located over the Antarctic continent; but in the Northern Hemisphere it is in the midst of the Arctic Ocean, leaving a pole-centered circular region of missing data on the Northern Hemisphere sea ice maps from the SMMR and SSMI data.<P><hr size=3 width=52% align=left><P><B>Record length</B><P>One of the major limitations of current satellite passive microwave data sets for use in climate studies is the fact that the satellite passive microwave record only began in December 1972, making the record too short for establishing a long-term climatological data base or for resolving many climate issues. This is clearly a limitation that can be overcome, but only with time and with continued satellite coverage.<P><center><B><a href="Antice.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="Index.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Conc.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a><P></b></center><BR><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P></body></html>

That is, individual features and ice types, including ridges, hummocks, melt ponds, and modes of the sea-ice thickness distribution function, are recognizable over time intervals of months to years. Changes of water masses beneath the ice element occur relatively slowly compared with atmospheric air masses and cloud elements that may change on time scales of days or less.  These factors imply that the ice cover and possibly the upper ocean provide the "memory" of the system under study, while the atmosphere provides the time-dependent forcing on this system.</P><P>To address the primary SHEBA objectives, measurements during the main experiment must quantify the large seasonal changes for a representative region of pack ice centered on the main camp.  The measurements must also quantify the principal processes and fluxes that cause these changes.  The processes and fluxes vary on a variety of time scales, including diurnal, cloud-advective, synoptic and seasonal.<BR>  <BR>The vertical coupling studies require a set of Continuos Core Measurements (CCM) to be made at and in the immediate vicinity of the SHEBA camp.  The CCM program aims to produce nearly continuous time series that portray conditions in the upper ocean, the sea ice and the  atmosphere as they evolve over an annual cycle. The CCM variables are the most relevant for documenting the energy and mass balances of the ice-ocean portion of the system, and for documenting the coupling among the upper ocean, the ice and the atmosphere. </P><P>The vertical coupling between the ice, atmosphere and upper ocean is illustrated schematically in <A NAME="fig1"> <A HREF="schem.htm">Figure 1 </A> and <A NAME="fig2"> <A HREF="icemod.htm">Figure 2</A> </A>.  To assess the interactions that are at the heart of the ice-albedo and cloud-radiation feedback mechanisms, SHEBA must examine the processes that affect the vertical distribution of energy, moisture and momentum in the Arctic.  In the context of the vertical coupling, the observational strategy at the ice camp is designed to address the following:</P><UL><LI>modulation of the ice mass balance by  ice/atmosphere and ice/ocean fluxes<LI>disposition of radiation fluxes through the atmosphere, sea ice and upper ocean column<LI>influence of ice and cloud properties on the surface fluxes<LI>influence of atmospheric and sea ice processes on the heat and salt balance of the upper ocean</UL><P>Estimating the disposition of radiation fluxes through the atmosphere, sea ice and upper ocean  requires concurrent measurements of the state of the atmosphere, sea ice and upper ocean, along with the resulting fluxes of radiation.  In principle, the vertical profile of radiative fluxes, including fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface, can be calculated with sophisticated radiative transfer models if the properties of the surface, atmosphere and clouds are specified accurately enough.  Observations of radiation flux may be used to test such model calculations, and provide continuity and consistency checks on the surface radiation measurements. The main purpose of this strategy is to improve our knowledge of how the state of this air-sea-ice column affects the radiation fluxes.</P><P>Although the average equilibrium thickness of the ice in the Arctic Ocean is about 3 m, the ice cover is heterogeneous  on horizontal scales of tens of meters, with variations in sea ice thickness ranging from zero in leads to tens of meters in pressure ridges.  These variations in thickness result from the interactions of ice dynamics and thermodynamics.  Associated with these thickness variations are variations in ice age, snow cover, albedo, and many other parameters. This heterogeneity influences how the ice interacts thermodynamically and dynamically with the atmosphere and the ocean (Figures 1 and 2).</P><P>This heterogeneity has implications for the design of measurements at the SHEBA ice camp.  The local measurements at the ice camp can be divided into process-oriented time series observations at sites representative  of the major ice and surface types, and surveys to determine the spatial coverage of these ice and surface types.  Observations  are required for each of the following ice and surface types:  first-year and multi-year ice, blue ice, white ice, hummocks, ridges, melt ponds and leads.  Even different representatives of the same surface type may be associated with different characteristics.  Special observing periods may be used to assess such variability and to address the issue of spatial averaging.</P>

An understanding of the role of the Arctic Ocean as a global heat sink requires accurate prediction of the heat content of the arctic atmosphere and ocean.  Accurate simulation of the Arctic heat sink requires accurate determination of the arctic temperatures, which depend on sea ice and cloud characteristics and their interactions with atmospheric and ocean dynamics.  Another key feature that can only be examined in the context of a coupled global climate model is the export of relatively fresh water from the Arctic Ocean into the North Atlantic, the role that this export plays in modulating the North Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation, and the subsequent feedback onto the arctic climate system.  Accurate simulation of the fresh water export into the North Atlantic Ocean requires accurate simulation of ice thermodynamics and dynamics and the atmospheric and oceanic forcing of the sea ice.</P><P>A number of GCM intercomparison programs are underway.  Simulation of the arctic climate by GCMs is currently being addressed by the Atmospheric Modeling Intercomparison Project (AMIP).  Intercomparison of the arctic climate simulated by existing and improved GCMs will be encouraged by preparation from the SHEBA observations of comprehensive summary datasets that would serve to evaluate model performance.</P><P>Based upon our current understanding of the performance of GCMs in the Arctic,  improved model parameterizations are needed of clouds, the atmospheric boundary layer, sea ice, and the ocean mixed layer.  Model parameterizations that are tested in the regional  model can be incorporated into the GCMs.  Utilization of coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs with improved parameterizations will be the ultimate tool to evaluate and interpret the climate feedbacks occurring in the Arctic and the extension of the influence of arctic physical processes to the global climate system.</P>

The SHEBA field program features comprehensive and concurrent measurements of the atmosphere, sea ice, and upper ocean, including the fluxes that occur at the air-ice-ocean interfaces. The observational strategy must facilitate both physical interpretation and integration with satellite observations and climate models.  To take full advantage of this opportunity to measure processes year-round in the pack ice of the Arctic Ocean, SHEBA measurements made from surface, aircraft, submarine, and satellite platforms must be coordinated carefully. </P><P>There are two main parts to the conceptual design of the SHEBA field experiment.  The first part consists of a time series of measurements for a period of a year (starting spring 1997) over a region of pack ice of sufficient size and variability to contain numerous surface features that vary in physical properties (such as bare ice, snow cover, melt  ponds, leads, ridges and ice of different ages and thicknesses).  As the camp drifts with the ice cover, changes in the mass of snow and ice and the energy storage can be monitored as they respond to the atmospheric and oceanic forcing.  Evaluation of these processes as they interact with the ice thickness distribution is the major challenge for the experimental design. The framework for the observations obtained in this time series is based upon the concept of providing input and test data for models of the radiative energy transfer through the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean system and single-column models of the coupled system that are analogues of a single grid cell in a GCM.</P><P>The second part of the observational strategy consists of process-oriented measurement campaigns.  These brief campaigns consist of measurements that are designed to support analysis and modeling of relatively short-lived phenomena, extend the spatial scale of the observations beyond the ice camp,  or require expensive observational equipment or platforms that are not available routinely during the field experiment (e.g. submarines, research aircraft).   During the field experiment, we plan to conduct campaigns to measure:  characteristics of the cloudy boundary layer using aircraft; surface characteristics during the summertime melt season using aircraft remote sensing; mesoscale heat and salt budgets of the upper ocean; and interactions between the atmosphere, ocean and ice in the presence of  leads.</P>

This distinction is complicated by variability associated with fronts.   To address this issue, a 100 km triangular array of buoy clusters will be established around the main camp.  Each cluster will include oceanographic buoys measuring upper ocean temperature and salinity, currents, and upper ocean turbulence.   The technology for these buoys is well established and has been used in numerous programs.

The sampling strategy derives from experience gained during numerous ice-borne  activities in both polar regions, notably CEAREX, ISW-92, LEADEX, and ANZFLUX.  The small-scale (< 10 km) flux program is the primary focus of the IOPs, while the helicopter-based mesoscale program (10-100 km) is necessary to provide context for the flux measurements in terms of horizontal variability  in the forcing and ocean.  The helicopter surveys may also provide short-term turbulence measurements in order to learn the spatial variability of the turbulence and determine fluxes under special conditions encountered away from camp.

The SCM can be used to examine physical processes and feedbacks, and also to test parameterizations of key physical processes for GCMs using data from the SHEBA field experiment.</P>SCM experiments require data sets beyond those to be obtained at the ice camp, including advection at the lateral boundaries. Additionally, the statistics that describe characteristics of the sea ice (e.g. lead fraction, ice thickness distribution, melt ponds) must be specified over the area of the grid cell.   The following parameters are required for model initialization, testing, or forcing at the boundaries: </P><OL><LI> vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature, humidity, wind velocity, cloud and aerosol  properties, and radiative fluxes<LI> vertical profiles of temperature, salinity and currents in the upper ocean<LI> vertical profiles of horizontal advection of atmospheric temperature and humidity and large-scale atmospheric divergence<LI> horizontal advection of heat and salt in the upper ocean<LI> statistics of the ice thickness distribution, lead fraction, snow cover, melt pond properties.</OL><P>Only some of the parameters in (1) are measured from the ice camp.  Profiles of aerosols and radiative fluxes in (1)  must be determined from aircraft (section 5.2).  The strategy for describing the aggregate of ice characteristics over the cell in (5) is described in section 5.3.  The strategy for determining horizontal advection of heat and salt into the upper ocean (4) is described in section 5.4.  The most difficult  aspect of conducting the SCM  experiment is to determine the atmospheric advection and divergence terms (3).  Use of boundary sites from which to determine the advection and divergence terms from radiosondes is not feasible for SHEBA.  An alternative strategy is to use soundings obtained from aircraft dropsondes during the boundary layer and sea ice aircraft campaigns or unmanned aerospace vehicles (UAVs).  Satellite profiles of temperature and humidity may also be used.   Areally-averaged surface fluxes over the grid cell can be estimated by using the detailed measurements made at the ice camp over ice with different characteristics in concert with the aircraft and submarine surveys of ice characteristics and satellite observations. </P><P>Since aircraft are required for several aspects of the SCM dataset, the SCM experiments will be restricted to the periods during which the aircraft are available.  To maximize the value of the SCM dataset, the ocean IOPs should concur with the aircraft measurements.</P><P>Detailed and accurate determination of horizontal advection in the ocean and atmosphere and the spatial variability of ice characteristics is possible only during the special observing periods when aircraft, helicopter, and submarines are available, which is approximately 20% of the duration of the experiment.  Outside these intensive observation periods, the ocean advection will be estimated using observations from the mesoscale array, the atmospheric advection will be determined using NWP products or special analyses for SHEBA (see section 6.1), and the spatial variability of the ice characteristics will be estimated using satellite data.  Comparison of these estimates with values obtained during the intensive observation periods will provide a feasibility check on this methodology.</P>

The sea ice cover affects the radiative balance of the Earth and radically changes the fluxes of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean. Both the atmospheric and oceanic circulations at midlatitudes are affected by processes in the polar oceans; seasonal variability as well as interannual charges are reflected in and partially caused by changes in ice cover and ice transport.<P>The principal contributions of NASA to national and international programs of research on global climate and the dynamics of global change derive from broad applications of space technology to such programs. Satellite data provide time series of synoptic data; little or no such data are available from observations from aircraft buoys land stations or ships. As we are now beginning to discover new uses and methods of interpretation of satellite data, it is important to make overviews of data available to the scientific community so that investigators can determine where further exploration may be possible using the data and other observations.<P>This publication summarizes the observations of the Arctic made by the Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer on board the Nimbus 5 research satellite over the period 1973 through 1976. It is hoped that the information will make this book a useful reference for Climatologists and polar oceanographers.<P>W.

They will probably recognize that it is a sequel to an earlier (1983) atlas by nearly the same group of scientists at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the United States Geological Survey entitled Antarctic Sea ice, 1973-1976: Satellite Passive-Microwave Observations. Now both of the polar regions have been heard from loudly and clearly.<P>What, exactly, is this atlas at about? In a nutshell, it summarizes the observations made of the Arctic by the Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) onboard the Nimbus 7 polar orbiting meteorological satellite. A major advantage of microwave observations over the more common visible and infrared satellite observations is that the former can penetrate clouds. Furthermore, the microwave data can be collected both day and night. I his atlas also explains in some detail how these microwave observations can be interpreted in terms of area of ocean covered by sea ice and the kind of ice (whether first-year or multiyear ice). it even goes into the climatology of the Arctic and the reasons For the seasonally changing distributions and motions of the ice pack under the influence of winds and ocean currents.<P>To call this volume an "atlas" is actually misleading, since it is obviously much more than that. To be sure, it contains a large number of beautiful maps in many colors depicting various aspects of the state of the Arctic in a 4-year period in the 1970s, but its significance and its message extend far beyond those maps. The oceanic and atmospheric processes that take place in the Arctic are crucial to the weather and climate of the entire Northern Hemisphere, and here we have a moving picture of the Arctic as seen from space with a completeness and clarity never before achieved. Furthermore, this volume contains the information needed to study the details of the changes in the Arctic Ocean that may well ensue if the global warming that many believe is now taking place accelerates in the years ahead. Rarely have climatologists had such a good milestone from which to start.<P>The text that accompanies and explains the satellite passive-microwave observations is excellent, and indeed the report as a whole is a kind of textbook on the processes involved in the freezing and thawing of sea ice - as well as the remote sensing techniques for observing them. (The same can be said of the preceding volume.) However, the sense of excitement and adventure that has motivated this team of scientists from the start seems to be carefully muted in their own professional accounts.<P>To appreciate this sense of excitement one should turn back the clock a good many years, to the period when Dr. William Nordberg of the Goddard Space Flight Center and his colleagues (numbering among them some of the present authors) were developing and testing the first of those microwave radiometers from jet aircraft flying high over the frozen Arctic.<P>The instrument worked well enough, as it turned out, and the next challenge was to demonstrate that its measurements could be interpreted in a useful way in terms of the actual conditions in the ice pack far below the observing platform - as has now been amply illustrated in this volume.<P>Enter the eager apostles of 'ground truth.' These were the men and women who ventured into the ice pack in ships, who flew over it in helicopters and light planes, and who lived for months at a time in observing stations on the shifting sea ice, far from shore. (Again, many of the present authors were involved in this kind of activity. One of them, demonstrating an audacity that belied his very considerable intelligence, seas the first person to don diving gear and explore the ice pack from underneath.)<P>The pictures in Chapter 1 convey a small idea of the environment that they faced - but I note that these photographs seem to have always been taken in good weather. Perhaps the most ambitious of these ventures onto the Arctic ice was the Arctic ice Dynamics Joint Experiment (AIDJEX), largely sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research, with the cooperation of NASA and the Canadian Polar Continental Shelf Project. Some readers might not know that the drifting triangle shown in Figure 3-7 marks where men and women were living in the AIDJEX tents and huts. They lived there in four stations until, one day in October 1975, the ice split apart with a loud crackling sound and a lead of open water suddenly threaded its way through the base station, dividing it in two and leaving the mess hall hanging out over the water. (In spite of this, the AIDJEX carried on to the scheduled end of its mission in April 1976.)<P>So the days of Arctic exploration and adventure in the pursuit of science are far from a thing of the past. There are new and compelling reasons for going there, of course, including the oil and other natural resources to be found there, and the probability that the Arctic Ocean has already become an important theater of operations for both U.S. and Soviet submarines. And, as referred to earlier, a progressively warmer Earth would undoubtedly make the Arctic more attractive for a variety of other activities, including a laboratory for the study of climate change in progress.<P>We must therefore look upon this atlas of the Arctic as but one step in a continuing research effort, an effort in which NASA will, as in the past, join forces with other government agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the Department of Defense (DOD), and with other countries bordering on the Arctic Ocean.<P>This volume contains the record obtained by the Nimbus 5 satellite and its ESMR, a single-frequency radiometer that has now been retired from active duty. Now there are (or will shortly be) multichannel microwave radiometers on NASA, NOAA, and DOD satellites. The pioneering work of the Goddard Space Flight Center's Oceans and ice Branch, together with the USGS, has set the stage admirably for continuing surveys of the Arctic from the vantage point of space.<P>William W.

PARKINSON, JOSEFINO C. COMISO, H. JAY ZWALLY,<BR> DONALD J. CAVALIERI, PER GLOERSEN, WILLIAM J. CAMPBELL</FONT></center><P><BR><B>Summary</B><p>Sea ice is an important component in the highly interactive global climate system, reflections and influencing conditions in both the atmosphere and oceans. Although typically overlying approximately 7 percent of the world's oceans, the sea ice cover experiences considerable seasonal variability in both hemispheres: in the eight regions described in this atlas, encompassing most of the Northern Hemisphere sea ice area, the total extent of sea ice varies from a minimum of about 7.8 x l0^<font size=-2>6</font> square kilometers in September to a maximum of about 14.8 x l0^<font size=-2>6</font> square kilometers in March, and in the Southern Hemisphere the extent varies frown about 4 x l0^<font size=-2>6</font> square kilometers in February to about 20 x l0^<font size=-2>6</font> square kilometers in September. The ice significantly reduces the amount of solar radiation absorbed at the Earth's surface, greatly restricts exchanges of heat, mass, and momentum between ocean and atmosphere, and affects the density structure of the upper ocean through the salt and heat fluxes associated with the freezing and melting processes. The changes in density structure at times lead to deep-water and even bottom-water formation, and the net equatorward advection of sea ice provides a transport of cold, low-salinity water out of the polar regions. In this document, the sea ice cover of the Northern Hemisphere over the 4-year period 1973 through 1976 is described from the passive microwave data of the Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) on the Nimbus 5 satellite. The book is a companion volume to Antarctic Sea Ice, 1973-1976: Satellite Passive-Microwave Observations (Zwally et al., 1983a), and the two volumes together provide a global picture of sea ice conditions in the mid-1970s.<P>Data collected by the Nimbus 5 ESMR from its launch in December 1972 through most of the next 4 years provide the earliest all-weather, all-season imagery of global sea ice. For 39 months of the 4-year period, good quality Northern Hemisphere data were transmitted, and these data are the basis of the sea ice maps, plots, and analysis in this volume. The data have been interpolated for spatial and temporal gaps, averaged on a monthly basis into monthly averaged microwave brightness temperatures, and displayed in color coded polar maps. The large contrast in microwave emissivities between sea ice and open water enables a conversion of the brightness temperatures to sea ice concentrations (percentages of the ocean area covered by sea ice) providing that all sea ice in the field of view has approximately the same emissivity . in many of the seas and bays peripheral to the Arctic Ocean, the ice is predominantly first-year sea ice, with an emissivity near 0.92, so that a straightforward conversion from brightness temperatures to sea ice concentrations is possible. In the Arctic Ocean itself and some of the immediately adjacent waters, multiyear sea ice with an emissivity near 0.84 exists in addition to first-year sea ice, complicating the interpretations. In these areas, sea ice concentrations can be calculated from the brightness temperatures as a function of multiyear ice fraction. The same function is valid for first-year sea ice regions as well, with the multiyear ice fraction set at zero. Color-coded maps of the resulting sea ice concentrations are presented in monthly averaged formats, with associated nomograms relating the color scale, multiyear ice fraction, and sea ice concentration. Various other color-coded images, including ice concentration yearly averages, 4-year averages for individual months, and differences from month to month, are also presented, as are plots of a variety of variables such as total areas extent of sea ice, area of ice in various ice concentration categories, and area of actual ice coverage. The plots are presented for each of eight regions, covering most of the Northern Hemisphere sea ice area, and for the sum of the eight regions. The eight regions are the Arctic Ocean, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Bering Sea, Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay/Davis Strait, the Greenland Sea, the Kara and Barents Seas, and the Canadian Archipelago.<P>The ESMR data reveal many of the details of the distribution and dynamics of the Northern Hemisphere sea ice cover, including considerable interannual variability and interregional contrasts. At the time of maximum ice extent in March, the ice cover is nearly complete in the Arctic Ocean, Hudson Bay, the Kara Sea, and the Canadian Archipelago and is extensive for large portions of the other peripheral seas and bays. The springtime retreat of the ice edge tends to begin first in Davis Strait and the northern North Atlantic and last in the Bering Sea and Hudson Bay. At the time of minimum ice extent in September, the ice pack is mostly confined to the central Arctic Ocean and portions of the Greenland Sea, the Kara Sea, and the Canadian Archipelago. Essentially no ice remains in the Bering Sea, Hudson Bay, the Sea of Okhotsk, or Baffin Bay/Davis Strait. Noticeable autumn ice-edge advance begins first in the Greenland Sea, between August and September, then becomes apparent throughout the remainder of the ice-covered region between September and November.<P>Certain consistent latitudinal asymmetries in the extent of the ice are readily explained by major ocean currents, whereas many regional interannual contrasts in the ice are explainable by interannual differences in the atmospheric pressure and wind fields. Currents with major impacts include the warm, north-flowing Norwegian, west Greenland, and West Kamchatka Currents, which prevent or delay ice formation in the Parents Sea, immediately southwest of Greenland, and along the west coast of Kamchatka Peninsula, respectively, and the cold, south-flowing East Greenland and Labrador Currents, which transport ice far to the south along the east coasts of Greenland and Canada. Among the phenomena which appear closely connected to atmospheric conditions are the interannual variabilities in the timing of maximum sea ice extent in the Bering and Greenland Seas.<P>The ESMR data reveal an approximately symmetrical growth/decay cycle of the ice in the Northern Hemisphere and no systematic trend in the overall area of ice coverage over the 4 years 1973 through 1976. This contrasts with the situation revealed for the same 4 years for the Southern Hemisphere, where the seasonal ice decay proceeded far more rapidly than the seasonal ice growth and a marked decreasing trend was apparent in the overall ice area.<P><BR><center><a href="ArcPref.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc1-1.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a><P></center><BR><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

The highly variable ice cover in the Arctic has been the scene of dramatic human adventures, exemplified by historic attempts to find a Northwest Passage or to reach the North Pole. Its practical impacts include hindrance of shipping operations and oil extraction, plus modification of submarine acoustics. The sea ice edge in particular is a region of high biological productivity, with the distribution of sea ice affecting the distributions of marine resources in both polar regions (Alexander, 1980; Botkin et al., 1981). The climatic importance, however, along with its varied facets, is the aspect of most concern for the present volume.<P>Sea ice is a vital, interactive component of the Pinnate system, affecting and reflecting climate change. The presence of sea ice restricts exchanges of heat, mass, momentum, and chemical constituents between ocean and atmosphere, reduces the amount of solar radiation absorbed at the Earth's surface, and affects oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns (Barry, 1983; Fletcher, 1969: WMO/ICSU, 1982). The freezing and melting of the ocean surface and the associated fluxes of salt and heat produce major changes in the density structure of the ocean waters and are thus major factors in driving the thermohaline circulation (Warren, 1981). Also, the equatorward advection of sea ice provides a transport of cold, relatively fresh waters out of the polar regions. All of these factors contribute to making the study of sea ice an important part of the study of polar climate (Polar Research Board, 1984).<P>Data collected by the Nimbus 5 Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR), launched in December 1972, provided the first all-weather, all-season imagery of global sea ice. Good-quality data were transmitted from the ESMR for much of the next 4 years, creating a sound data base for examining sea ice conditions in the mid-l 970s. The Southern Hemisphere sea ice observations from the ESMR are described in Antarctic Sea ice, 1973-1976: Satellite Passive-Microwave Observations (Zwally et al., 1983a), hereafter referred to as Antarctic Sea Ice, 1973-1976, whereas the Northern Hemisphere sea ice observations are described in this companion volume. Together, the two volumes provide a global picture of sea ice conditions in the mid-1970s.<P>As the maps in this volume indicate, at the summer minimum sea ice covers roughly 8 x 10 million square kilometers in the central Arctic, reaching to the north coast of Greenland and to many of the northern Canadian islands but not to the coast along much of the Alaskan, Siberian and European coastlines. During winter the ice cover expands considerably, covering almost the entire Arctic Ocean and portions of many of the peripheral seas and bays, in particular the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, Greenland Sea, Barents Sea, and tiara Sea. At its maximum each year, the area coverage of Northern Hemisphere sea ice is about 15 x 10 millionsquare kilometers, yielding a seasonal range of 8 to 15 x 10 million square kilometers in Northern Hemisphere sea ice, far less than the 4 to 20 x 10 million square kilometer range of sea ice area in the Southern Hemisphere. The ESMR data described in this volume and in Antarctic Sea ice, 1973-1976 show the interannual variations in these basic features over the 4 years 1973 through 1976, as well as details of the seasonal and regional sea ice covers.<P><center><a href="ArcSumm.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc1-2.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a><P></center><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

CAMPBELL</FONT></center><P><BR><B>1.2 Sea Ice As A Component Of The Climate System</B><p>The large area of seasonal and perennial ice in the Arctic has a significant climatic impact that varies seasonally and regionally. In winters the ice serves as an insulator, restricting exchanges between the relatively warm ocean waters and the extremely cold polar atmosphere. The strength of the insulation is such that the flux of heat to the atmosphere from the open water and thin ice in leads and polynyas can exceed by two orders of magnitude the flux of heat conducted through the adjacent thicker ice (Maykut, 1978). in spring and summer, although the ice covers less area and the temperature contrast between ocean and atmosphere is smaller, the ice still plays a significant role, reducing the total solar heating of the Earth's surface by reflecting four to seven times as large a fraction of the incident solar radiation as open water reflects.<P>As ice forms during fall and winter, salt rejection tends to increase the density of the oceanic mixed layer, often leading to a deepening of that layer. In some regions characterized by a weak or unstable density structure, this can lead to the formation of deep water and bottom water, thereby affecting much of the world's deep-ocean circulation. In fact, it is believed that a large part of the world' s bottom water derives initially from polar latitudes, in the region of the sea ice cover (Stommel, 1962; Gordon, 1978; Warren, 1981; Killworth, l983). Furthermore, as the ice melts in spring and summer, the resulting relatively fresh water layer creates a strong oceanic vertical salinity gradient and thus aft acts the vertical density gradient and thereby surface water circulations.<P>The freezing and melting of the ice also affect climate by releasing energy (during the change of state from liquid to solid) in the winter season and absorbing energy (during the change of state from solid to liquid) in the summer, thus reducing seasonal temperature extremes. The same mechanism reduces regional temperature contrasts as well, because of the overall ice dynamics which produce a net outflow of ice from the Arctic Ocean: the net ice formation in the central Arctic releases heat to the polar oceans and atmosphere while the net ice decay farther equatorward absorbs heat from the subpolar oceans and atmosphere. The result has been termed a "negative heat transport" out of the polar regions.<P>This is complemented by a similar situation regarding salt transport. The salt rejection process increases water salinities in regions of net ice formation and results in sea ice having much lower salinities than sea water. Consequently, in regions of net ice decay the melting of the ice produces decreased upper ocean salinities. The net equatorward transport of ice therefore contributes to increasing water salinities in the polar regions and decreasing water salinities in the subpolar regions. This is sometimes referred to as a "negative salt transport" out of the regions, analogously to the negative heat transport.<P>The sea ice cover, in turn, is influenced by both the atmosphere and the oceans, as detailed in <a href="Arc2-1.htm">Chapter 2</a>. Winds and currents directly affect ice motions, whereas ocean temperatures and salinities are crucial in the timing of ice formation and bottom melt, and atmospheric temperatures and cloud cover directly affect surface melt. Sea ice, hence, is intricately connected to the rest of the climate system, influencing and being influenced by the other major climatic components.<P>The intricate connection of sea ice to the rest m the climate system adds to the importance of sea ice records, since these records shed light on the more general climate state. For example, observations suggest that sea ice in the North Atlantic extended several degrees farther equatorward during the Little Ice Age of the mid- 15th to mid- 18th centuries than it does today and extended as far south as 50 degrees N during the last glacial maximum approximately 18,000 years ago. Documentary records of ice conditions, such as those recorded for the coast of Iceland over the past millennium. can be useful as climate indicators, as can much longer term but less explicit evidence of the ice edge position deduced from sea-floor sediments {Lamb, 1972; CLIMAP Project Members, 1976; Imbrie and Imbrie, 1977; Ruddiman and McIntyre, 1977, 1979, 1981). Satellite imagery, and particularly passive microwave imagery, is now providing far more detailed and consistent global sea ice records than any records obtainable in the past.<P><center><a href="Arc1-1htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc1-3.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a><P></center><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

PARKINSON, JOSEFINO C. COMISO, H. JAY ZWALLY,<BR> DONALD J. CAVALIERI, PER GLOERSEN, WILLIAM J. CAMPBELL</FONT></center><P><BR><B>2.1 Introduction</B><P>Sea ice formation, growth, and decay are all influenced by oceanographic and meteorological factors. Sea ice in turn influences both the atmosphere and the ocean through complex interactive processes in the interconnected ocean/ice/atmosphere system. (See Crane, 1978; Rogers, 1978; Rogers and van Loon, 1979; Walsh and Johnson, 1979b; Crawford and Parkinson, 1981; Walsh and Sater, 1981; Crane et al., 1982; Crane, 1983; Niebauer, 1983; Parkinson and Gratz, 1983; Wadhams and Squire, 1983; Lemke, 1986). This chapter summarizes some of the major oceanographic and atmospheric features affecting the sea ice of the north polar region.<P>Oceanographic factors play a primary role in determining the timing and amount of sea ice formation. Surface water temperatures, of course, must be at or below the freezing point before ice will form; but the freezing point depends on the salinity, and the formation of ice at the freezing point depends on the existence of condensation nucleii. Condensation nucleii favor ice formation, as do low surface salinities, deriving, for instance, from freshwater river inflows. The salinity effect results from the decrease of the freezing point with increasing salinity. Another factor relevant to sea ice formation is that the density of ocean water (assuming salinities above 24.7 parts per thousand) increases as the temperature decreases to the freezing point. This often causes convection and delays the formation of ice at the surface. The depth over which active convection occurs, termed the "convective depth," determines the amount of water that needs to be cooled to or near the freezing point before freezing is likely to begin.<P>Naturally, all other factors that influence surface water temperatures, such as atmospheric conditions, solar radiation, and heat flux from deeper waters, also influence ice formation. Furthermore, once ice has formed, the continuing influence of oceanographic factors is complemented by direct atmospheric influences, particularly through the contributions of wind stress to ice motion, snowfall to ice insulation, and atmospheric temperatures and radiative fluxes to surface ice melt.<P>This chapter provides an overview of relevant oceanographic features of the Arctic region, followed by an overview of relevant atmospheric features. The sections on oceanography include a discussion of the ocean bathymetry, which influences the large-scale ocean circulation and in some regions determines the convective depth, a discussion of the ocean circulation patterns, and a discussion of the surface temperature and salinity, the two water properties most relevant to sea ice formation. The sections on meteorology include discussions of the atmospheric temperature, pressure, and wind fields.<P><BR><center><a href="Arc1-6.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc2-2.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a></center><p><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

CAMPBELL</FONT></center><P><BR><B>1.3 Sea Ice Formation And Types</B><p>Sea ice is a complex material formed by the freezing of sea water and composed of all three phases of matter: a so id phase consisting of ice crystals and salt precipitates, a liquid phase consisting of a brine solution, and a gaseous phase in the form of air pockets. Physically, sea ice varies from fine ice particles suspended in water to thick blocks of ice hundreds of meters across. On a large scale, sea ice, although often very compact, never completely covers the ocean, because differential motion, fracturing, and melting of the ice that cause the formation of open-water areas. These include narrow, roughly linear "<I>leads</I>" (Figures <a href="Fig1-1.htm">1-1</a>, <a href="Fig1-2.htm">1-2</a>, <a href="Fig1-3.htm">1-3</a>, and  <a href="Fig1-4.htm">1-4</A>), ranging from meters to kilometers in width, and broader "<I>polynyas</I>," ranging in area to thousands of square kilometers. Frequent deformation of the ice pack tends to break uniform expanses of ice into irregular shapes called "<I>floes</I>" (Figures <a href="Fig1-5.htm">1-5</a>, <a href="Fig1-6.htm">1-6</a>, <a href="Fig1-7.htm">1-7</a>,  <a href="Fig1-8.htm">1-8</A>). Other irregularities in the ice cover include the "<I>ridges</I> formed when ice is compressed with sufficient force to crumble it into piled rows of broken ice (Figures <a href="Fig1-3.htm">1-3</a>, <a href="Fig1-8.htm">1-8</A>, and <a href="Fig1-9.htm">1-9</A>) and the "<I>rafted floes</I>" formed as one ice floe overrides another (Figures <a href="Fig1-5.htm">1-5</a> and <a href="Fig1-7.htm">1-7</A>). Ice floe thicknesses in the central Arctic average 2 to 4 meters (Maykut and Untersteiner, 1971), although ridges and the underlying keels sometimes measure up to 30-meters thick (Weeks, 1976). Some ice floes remain in the Arctic for decades; others remain no more than a few months, being located in regions of extensive summer melting or in regions from which the ice moves into warmer waters.<P>	Sea ice varies significantly in both space and time, being affected, especially during its formation, by air temperature, winds, currents, and water salinity. As a result, many different types of sea ice have been defined. As sea water begins to freeze, individual ice crystals, spicules, and platelets form first, Brazil ice" being the term given to fine spicules suspended in water. When sea ice is formed under calm conditions, the ice crystals often coagulate to form a solid sheet; but when the water is agitated by waves or currents, the crystals frequently form a soupy layer on the surface termed "grease ice" (<a href="Fig1-10.htm">Figure 1-10</A>). "Slush," by contrast, is a viscous floating mass formed initially from a mixture of snow and water (<a href="Fig1-11.htm">Figure 1-11</a>). "Shuga," often formed from grease ice or slush under agitated conditions, is an accumulation of spongy ice pieces a few centimeters across. "Nilas" is a later stage of new ice, after the ice has consolidated into a thin elastic sheet of 0.01 to 0.1 meter in thickness. This sheet is highly flexible, bending easily with waves and swell. Under sufficient pressure, it has a tendency to thrust into a pattern of interlocking "fingers" called "finger rafting" (<a href="Fig1-12.htm">Figure 1-12</a>).<P>	At times ocean waves cause grease ice, shuga, slush, or nilas to break and form into predominantly circular pieces of ice from 0.3 to 3 meters in diameter. Such ice, termed "pancake ice," can be up to 0.1-meter thick and often has raised rims all along its edge, produced by the striking of ice pieces against each other (<a href="Fig1-13.htm">Figure 1-13</a>).<P>	As the sea ice surface consolidates, brine is trapped between the ice crystals, accounting for the high salinity of newly consolidated ice. Further ice thickening proceeds through downward growth driven by heat loss to the atmosphere. The resulting ice, termed "columnar ice," has a characteristic columnar structure of crystals with vertical basal planes. Ice that has thickened to 0.10 to 0.30 meter is termed "young ice," a classification with two subclassifications named according to color but defined according to thickness: "gray ice" is young ice that is 0.10- to 0.15-meter thick, and "gray-white ice" is young ice that is 0.15- to 0.30-meter thick. Gray ice is less elastic than nilas and tends to raft under pressure. Gray-white ice is still less elastic and tends to ridge under pressure.<p>	When sea ice reaches a thickness of 0.30 meter, it is termed "first-year ice" (Figures <a href="Fig1-5.htm">1-5</a>, <a href="Fig1-6.htm">1-6</a>, <a href="Fig1-7.htm">1-7</a>, <a href="Fig1-8.htm">1-8</a>, <a href="Fig1-9.htm">1-9</a>, <a href="Fig1-14.htm">1-14a, and 1-14b</a>). It remains first-year ice until either disappearing or surviving a summer melt period. Undeformed first-year ice rarely reaches thicknesses greater than 2 meters, although ridged first-year ice can have local thicknesses in excess of 20 meters.<P>	Ice that has survived at least one summer melt period is substantially altered from first-year ice, because water from melt ponds (<a href="Fig1-15.htm">Figure 1-15</a>) percolates through the ice causing desalination of the surface and underlying layers. Such ice, termed "multiyear ice, " is distinguished by its low salinity and its rough, rolling, and hummocky surface (Figures <a href="Fig1-16.htm">1-16</a> and <a href="Fig1-17.htm">1-17</a>). [World Meteorological Organization (WMO) usage is more restrictive, terming ice that has survived only one melt season "second-year ice" and reserving "multiyear ice" for ice that has survived two or more melt seasons. To have ice classifications that correspond better with the distinctions observable from passive microwave imagery, in Chapter 3 we not only combine the WMO's "second-year ice" and "multiyear ice" but also combine frazil ice, grease ice, slush ice, shuga, and nilas into a category called "new ice" and include young ice in the first-year ice classification.]<P>	Around the rim of the Arctic Ocean, another category of ice, termed "shorefast ice," exists through much of the winter. This ice is attached to the shore or to anchoring points in the sea bed. Ice formation is aided in these areas by the shallow depth of the ocean, low salinities, and relatively quiescent surface conditions. Seaward from the shorefast ice there is in many areas a "shear zone," where winds drive the polar ice pack against the shorefast ice, causing heavy deformation and extensive pressure ridging.<P><BR><centeR><a href="Arc1-2.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc1-4.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a><P></center><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

Chapter 2 provides background material on the general physical characteristics of the Arctic Ocean and peripheral seas, the relevant oceanography and meteorology, and the connection with the sea ice cover. Chapter 3 presents mapped monthly averaged ESMR brightness temperature data, along with discussions of the theoretical basis for the microwave interpretations, aircraft and surface observations, error analyses, the ice concentration algorithm and nomogram, and the effects of such complicating factors as melt ponds and snow cover. The remaining two chapters deal with the sea ice conditions as determined from the ESMR brightness temperatures. In Chapter 4, these conditions are examined region by region for eight regions; and in Chapter 5, they are examined for the broader Northern Hemisphere perspective,for some comparisons with the Southern Hemisphere, and for interregional comparisons. These two chapters include plots of areal ice coverage for the individual regions and the sum of all eight regions, as well as spatial maps of sea ice concentrations. The division into regions is as follows: the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay/ Davis Strait, Greenland Sea, Kara and Barents Seas, Arctic Ocean, and the Canadian Archipelago. Technical details of the data handling are included in Appendix A, monthly contour maps of the ice edge are included in Appendix B. and selected histograms of sea ice concentrations are included in Appendix C. A list of acronyms used in the book is presented in Appendix D.<P>	Even though the ESMR data presented in this volume extend over only a 4-year period, in view of the good spatial and temporal resolution the data record reveals a great deal about Arctic sea ice conditions, the seasonal cycle of those conditions, the contrasts and interactions among regions, and the interannual variability. Analysis of the 4-year ESMR data set has revealed previously unidentified complexities in the ice cover in terms of both structure and dynamics. Sizable areas of reduced microwave emission have been found in the central Arctic Ocean pack, the variable and recurring nature of several polynyas has been determined, and a more complicated circulation pattern is indicated than the well known schematic representation of a Beaufort Gyre and a Transpolar Drift Stream. The record of sea ice distributions revealed in this volume should be valuable for studies of climate, the atmosphere and oceans, and marine resources, and for planning operational activities in the Arctic region.<P><BR><center><a href="Arc1-5.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc2-1.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a> <P></center><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

CAMPBELL</FONT></center><P><BR><B>2.2 Bathymetry</B><P>The Arctic Ocean contains approximately 13 x 10<font size=-2>6</font> cubic kilometers of water and extends over a horizontal area of about 12 x 10<font size=-2>6</font> square kilometers (Germans 1974). Surrounded by major land masses, this ocean is relatively isolated from the deep waters of the rest of the world ocean, having only one deep passage into it, that being the Fram Strait between Greenland and Spitsbergen. (See Figures <a href="Fig2-1.htm">2-1</a> and <a href="Fig2-2.htm">2-2</a>.) The continental shelf around the Arctic is unusually broad and shallow north of Europe and Asia, where the widths are approximately 1000 kilometers in the Barents Sea and 800 kilometers north of Siberia. By contrast, in the Western Hemisphere, from Greenland to Barrow, Alaska, the shelf extends approximately 100 kilometers from land. A major bathymetric feature of the central Arctic is the Lomonosov Ridge, which forms a boundary between the two major Arctic deep-ocean basins: the Canadian Basin in the Western Hemisphere and the smaller but generally deeper Eurasian Basin in the Eastern Hemisphere. Another prominent feature is the Chukchi Rise, which extends 700 kilometers northward into the Canadian Basin <a href="Fig2-2.htm">(Figure 2-2)</a>.<P>Surrounding the central Arctic Ocean are several seas that have seasonal sea ice covers. The Kara and Barents Seas lie over the Eurasian continental shelf, and the Norwegian, Greenland, and Labrador Seas lie over deep basins that allow inflow and outflow of Atlantic waters. In this volume, the Laptev, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas are considered part of the Arctic Ocean.<P>The Bering Sea is connected to the central Arctic by the narrow (85-kilometers wide), shallow (45 meters deep) Bering Strait and is bounded to the south by the Aleutian Islands and to the east and west by Alaska and the Kamchatka Peninsula, respectively  <a href="Fig2-1.htm">(Figure 2-1)</a>. The continental shelf is unusually wide and flat in the northeast, covering over a third of the sea. The shelf along the Kamchatka coast, by contrast, is extremely narrow, and much of the basin in the southwest Bering Sea has depths greater than 3000 meters <a href="Fig2-2.htm">(Figure 2-2)</a>.<P>The major bathymetric features of the Sea of Okhotsk include three relatively deep basins and a shallow shelf area that is most extensive in the northern portion of the sea. The basins are the 500-meter-deep Tinro Basin, the 1600-meter-deep Derugin Basin, and the even deeper Kuril Basin to the south of the region mapped in <a href="Fig2-2.htm">Figure 2-2</a> (which is identical to the region included in the ESMR brightness temperature maps of Chapter 3 and the derived ice concentration maps of Chapter 4). Since for most of the Sea of Okhotsk the sea floor is effectively the bottom of the convective layer, the depth of water that needs to be cooled before freezing begins is largely determined by the bathymetry (Leonov, 1960). Baffin Bay is deeper, with some depths exceeding 2000 meters, whereas Hudson Bay is much shallower, with no depths exceeding 500 meters <a href="Fig2-2.htm">(Figure 2-2)</a>.<P><BR><centeR><a href="Arc2-1.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc2-3.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a></center><p><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

PARKINSON, JOSEFINO C. COMISO, H. JAY ZWALLY,<BR> DONALD J. CAVALIERI, PER GLOERSEN, WILLIAM J. CAMPBELL</FONT></center><P><BR><B>1.4 Sea Ice Properties</B><p>	Among the important properties of sea ice for the analysis of microwave emissions are its salinity, density, snow cover, and thickness, all of which vary at least somewhat among ice types. New ice and firstyear ice tend to be characterized by relatively high salinities and smooth surfaces, with the initial salinity strongly influenced by the rate of freezing (Weeks and Ackley, 1982). <a href="Fig1-18.htm">Figure 1-18</a> shows a sequence of salinity profiles for such ice from a site in Eclipse Sound near Pond Inlet, Baffin Island. At this site, the salinities in the top 25 millimeters, from which most of the microwave emission occurs, fluctuate from 7 to 14 parts per thousand. The temporary periods of surface salinity increase within the ice-growth season are believed to be atypical.<P>	Generally, the amount of brine held in the freeboard portion of the ice decreases with time. This is especially true during the summer melt period, when flushing occurs as the surface meltwater percolates through the ice, although much of the salt can be lost by simple drainage before the ice surface becomes permeable (Holt and Digby, 1985). Brine drainage can also be caused by thermal expulsion or by downward movement of the relatively heavy brine due to gravitation (Untersteiner, 1968; Lake and Lewis, 1970). First-year ice with a snow cover and an intervening snow-ice layer formed from the melting and refreezing of the snow typically has its highest salinity in the snow-ice layer and has a temperature profile such that temperature increases with depth (<a href="Fig1-19.htm">Figure 1-19a</a>). Cores collected from hummocks on multiyear ice generally show a systematic increase of salinity from 0 at the surface to about 4 parts per thousand at the bottom of the ice floe, whereas those from depressions are much more saline and show large salinity fluctuations. A plot of the salinity and temperature profiles from a hummocked multiyear ice floe is shown in <a href="Fig1-19.htm">Figure 1-19b</a>. Both temperature and salinity tend to increase with depth.<P>	The density of sea ice is affected by brine content, air pockets, and other inhomogeneities in the ice. For first-year ice, the density is typically about 900 to 920 kilograms per cubic meter, whereas for multiyear ice, the values are somewhat lower and show greater variation, reflecting, in part, nonuniformity in the brine drainage in the portion of the sea ice above sea level (the freeboard layer). Examples of density profiles for several ice types are shown in <a href="Fig1-20.htm">Figure 1-20</a>. Surface measurements are not included because of the difficulty of obtaining representative surface samples.<P>	The amount of snowfall in the Arctic region varies spatially and from year to year. Soviet data from several years at several locations in the central Arctic show an average seasonal cycle in snow thickness exhibiting a slow increase from about 0.1 meter in September to a peak of about 0.4 meter in May, followed by a rapid decrease to 0.05 meter in July (Loshchilov, 1964; Barry, 1983). If the snowload is heavy enough to submerge the ice surface, sea water intrudes into the snow/ice interface and freezes with the snow to form a modified surface layer. This refrozen layer is saline and has a crystal structure and composition that differ from those of the rest of the sea ice surface.<P>	The thickness distribution of Arctic ice is not well known, although multiyear ice is on average significantly thicker than first-year ice, and ice in the central pack is generally thicker than that near the ice edge. An equilibrium thickness of approximately 3 meters in the central Arctic has been suggested by modeling studies of Maykut and Untersteiner (1971), but thicknesses greater than 6 meters have been observed on undeformed ice (Walker and Wadhams, 1979), and ridges several times higher than that have been reported in the coastal regions north of Greenland and along the Canadian Archipelago (Weeks, 1976). Analysis of submarine data from Fram Strait has revealed average thicknesses of about 3 meters and 2 meters for multiyear and first-year ice floes, respectively, and analysis of submarine data from the Beaufort Sea region has revealed an average thickness of 3.7 meters (Wadhams and Horne, 1980). The amount of ridging varies significantly both regionally and temporally, with particularly heavy ridging occurring just north of Greenland. Ridging substantially increases the roughness of an ice surface and therefore dramatically affects the drag coefficient of the ice pack. It also changes the average salinity profile. Each of these factors leads to greater variance in the sea ice microwave signature in regions of heavy ridging.<P>	During the period in which freeze-thaw cycles occur, generally from May through September, additional physical properties of the freeboard layer contribute to determining the microwave signatures. Among the most important of these are the moisture content in the freeboard and overlying snow cover, plus melt ponding. As the melt period begins, the moisture content of the snow increases, with dramatic effects on the microwave emission, as discussed in Chapter 3. This is followed by a total melting of the snow and subsequent creation of melt ponds. Melt ponds generally consist of fresh water, although some contain salt water either because of flooding of the ice or because the pond has melted through to the sea below. In the latter case, what had been a melt pond in essence becomes a miniature polynya. Melt ponds in the Arctic grow rapidly in the early summer, and by mid-July have normally reached their maximum extent. Values of 25 to 30 percent for total melt pond area at the time of maximum melt are believed to be about average, although the available data are limited. Ten summers of Soviet "North Pole" station observations in the vicinity of 80 degrees N revealed an average melt-pond areal percentage of 25 percent for mid-July, with local values for individual ice floes reaching as high as 45 percent (Barry, 1983). The effects on microwave emission of the moisture content in the snow and ice, melt ponding, and other physical properties are discussed in Chapter 3.<P><BR><center><a href="Arc1-3.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc1-5.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a><P></center><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

Although surface, ship, and aircraft data are invaluable for determining local sea ice conditions, these data are not feasible for routine, continuing measurements over a large area, especially in the face of the harsh polar conditions. For the large scale, satellite imaging is the sole feasible method for obtaining consistent, long-term records.<P>	Some satellite data of sea ice in the visible and infrared wavelengths were available in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but these data could not be obtained during darkness and were often obscured by cloud cover during light, making quantitative estimates of the ice cover difficult. Since the polar regions are either dark or cloud covered for much of the year, these limitations of the visible and infrared wavelengths effectively prevented the generation of consistent, long-term data records. Accordingly, the all-weather, day/night features of the passive microwave data collected by the Nimbus 5 ESMR introduced a major advance in the usefulness of satellite sea ice imaging.<P>	The ESMR operated from its launch in December 1972 through March 1983, although with a significant reduction in data quality after October 1976 because of degeneration of the instrument. For various reasons discussed in Appendix A, notable gaps appear in the data even in the 4-year period 1973 through 1976. During these 4 years, however, a great deal of high-quality data was collected; and the purpose of this volume is to present the resulting data set for the Arctic region in an organized format, supplemented by discussion and analysis of the sea ice cover. The ESMR data have a spatial resolution of approximately 30 kilometers and an irregular temporal resolution, with the satellite orbit typically passing over a given Arctic location approximately four times a day. The combination of global coverage and fine-scale temporal resolution has allowed the satellite passive microwave data to reveal information on the cryosphere that is unattainable by any other available method.<P>	Before the Nimbus 5 satellite ESMR was launched, a prototype aircraft instrument was flown on the NASA aircraft "Galileo I" Convair 990 during several missions to the Arctic in the period 1967 through 1972. Missions in 1967 and 1970 established the existence of a strong contrast between the microwave signature of sea ice and that of open water (Wilheit et al., 1972), a contrast crucial to the use of the ESMR data for examining the sea ice cover and particularly for determining sea ice concentrations, as detailed in Chapters 3 and 4. Missions in 1971 and 1972 over the Beaufort Sea were undertaken in conjunction with ground observations from manned ice stations (Campbell, 1973). Later Convair 990 missions after the launch of the Nimbus 5 ESMR, along with ground observations during three major international experiments, allowed verification of the satellite data interpretations. The three experiments were the Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment (AIDJEX) (Untersteiner, 1980; Campbell et al., 1978) and the Skylab Snow and Ice Experiment (Campbell et al., 1977), both with participation from the United States and Canada, and the Bering Sea Experiment (BESEX) (Kondratyev et al., 1975), with participation from the United States and the Soviet Union. BESEX included a field expedition in the spring of 1973, Skylab included field expeditions in the winters and springs of 1973 and 1974, and AIDJEX included field expeditions throughout the year from spring 1975 through spring 1976.<P>	Analysis of the data collected by the Nimbus 5 ESMR and coincident data from ground and aircraft expeditions in 1973 through 1976 established several results of fundamental importance for the usefulness of the satellite data in determining sea ice conditions. These include further confirmation of the previously mentioned ability to distinguish sea ice from open water (Gloersen et al., 1975a), the ability to distinguish different sea ice types (Gloersen et al., 1973), and the ability to delineate the variation of ice types from season to season (Campbell et al., 1978), as well as the creation of an algorithm for calculating sea ice concentrations from the Nimbus 5 ESMR data (Gloersen et al., 1974). It is particularly important that even though the 30-kilometer resolution of the Nimbus 5 ESMR is not fine enough to resolve most individual ice floes, leads, or open-water areas within the ice pack, the percent ice coverage within the 30- by 30-kilometer grid squares can be derived from the microwave measurements, due to the sharp contrast between the microwave emission of sea ice and the microwave emission of open water. Details of this derivation are given in Chapter 3.<P>	Because the data from the Nimbus 5 ESMR provide the first detailed depiction of global sea ice conditions throughout the annual cycle, the compiled Arctic data in this volume and Antarctic data in Antarctic Sea Ice, 1973-1976 constitute an important climatic base to compare with sea ice conditions in the future. The Southern Hemisphere analysis was done first because the Northern Hemisphere analysis involves additional complications due to the distinctly different microwave signature of multiyear ice in the Arctic. Much of the Arctic summertime ice is subject to the depletion of salt in the upper layer during the summer melt period. This reduces the microwave emissivity of Arctic multiyear ice, giving it a value between the microwave emissivity of open water and that of first-year and younger ice, thus adding an ambiguity in the determination of sea ice concentrations or open-water fractions. The problem is not as severe in the Antarctic because only 20 percent of the winter Antarctic sea ice survives the summer (Zwally et al., 1983a), and much of that 20 percent does not experience significant surface summer melt (Andreas and Ackley, 1982).<P>	The ambiguities caused by the decreased microwave emissivity of Arctic multiyear ice and the various effects of snow cover, moisture, and melt ponding are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3. Because of these ambiguities, and because both multiyear ice and melt ponding cover large portions of the central Arctic, the sea ice concentration maps of Chapter 4 are accompanied by nomograms relating brightness temperature, ice concentration, and multiyear ice fraction. With multifrequency instruments, such as the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on the Nimbus 7 satellite, launched in 1978, multifrequency algorithms can be developed to eliminate some of the ambiguity inherent in single-frequency data, such as the data from the ESMR.<P>	The Nimbus 5 ESMR data have been used to produce 3-day-averaged maps of the Northern Hemisphere brightness temperatures for the years 1973 through 1976. For the months within that period with sufficient data available, the 3-day averages have been further averaged over monthly time periods to produce monthly averaged brightness temperature maps, with linear spatial and temporal interpolations used to fill in small data gaps. The resulting 39 monthly maps, presented in Chapter 3, cover all months from January 1973 through October 1976 except March, April, May, and August of 1973 and June, July, and August of 1975. Details of the mapping and interpolation procedures appear in Appendix A.<P>	The monthly averaged brightness temperature data have been used in conjunction with climatological atmospheric temperature data to produce monthly averaged sea ice concentration maps. These maps indicate the percent of the ocean area covered by sea ice in each 30- by 30-kilometer map element. The technique for obtaining ice concentrations is based on a linear relationship between an average observed brightness temperature of 138.3 K for open water (including atmospheric effects) and an observationally determined brightness temperature of sea ice that depends on the ice temperature and ice emissivity. Multiyear ice fractions are accounted for by the associated nomograms. Details of the nomogram and the ice concentration determinations are provided in Chapter 3, with the ice concentration maps being presented in Chapter 4. The estimated accuracy of the derived sea ice concentrations is +15 percent over regions of predominantly first-year ice and + 25 percent over regions with an unknown mixture of first-year ice and multiyear ice.<P><BR><centeR><a href="Arc1-4.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc1-6.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a><P></center><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

CAMPBELL</FONT></center><P><BR><B>2.3 OCEAN CIRCULATION</B><P><a href="Fig2-3.htm">(Figure 2-3)</a> is a schematic diagram of the general surface water circulations in the Arctic region. The warm North Atlantic Current, extending northeastward from the Gulf Stream, and the Norwegian Current extending northeastward from the North Atlantic Current, contribute to maintaining the Norwegian Sea free of ice. The Atlantic waters enter the central Arctic largely through Fram Strait between Greenland and Spitsbergen, although some also enter through the passage between Spitsbergen and Norway. Much of this inflow of Atlantic waters occurs as a warm, saline undercurrent. The flow of the surface waters between the North Atlantic and the Arctic is generally outward from the Arctic rather than inward, flowing largely in the ice-laden waters of the Transpolar Drift Stream and the East Greenland Current. The surface flow through the Bering Strait, by contrast, is generally into the Arctic, with the northward transport from the Bering Sea averaging over 1 x 10<font size=-2>6</font> cubic meters per second for the April through October season for which measurements are available (Coachman, 1980). Major freshwater in flows to the Arctic include those from the Mackenzie River on the North American side, the Lena River in Siberia, and, particularly, the Ob and Yenisei Rivers into the Kara Sea. The flows into the Kara Sea account for 40 percent of the 100 x 103 cubic meters per second river inflow to the Arctic (Aagaard, 1980).<P:>Two major features of the Arctic surface water circulation are the anticyclonic, clockwise gyre in the Canadian Basin, often called the Beaufort Gyre or sometimes the Pacific Gyre, and the Transpolar Drift Stream running lengthwise across the Eurasian Basin from off the Siberian coast out through the western Fram Strait. The Transpolar Drift Stream as it flows southward becomes the East Greenland Current, flowing from north to south along the east coast of Greenland <a href="Fig2-3.htm">(Figure 2-3)</a>. The average rate of flow is only 2 to 3 centimeters per second in the Laptev Sea, increasing to 8 to 10 centimeters per second in the Fram Strait. In the Beaufort Gyre, the rates of flow are generally about 2 to 3 centimeters per second (Aagaard, 1980).<P>Surface Atlantic waters flow into Davis Strait and Baffin Bay along their eastern boundaries in the northward flowing West Greenland Current. These waters circulate through Davis Strait and Baffin Bay in a counterclockwise direction, exiting on the west into the Labrador Sea and proceeding southward along the coast of Newfoundland. The flow in Baffin Bay is affected also by inputs from Smith Sound between Ellesmere Island and Greenland and, to a lesser extent, by the flows from Lady Ann Strait between Ellesmere Island and Devon Island and from Lancaster Sound between Devon Island and Baffin Island.<P>Pacific waters enter the Bering Sea through multiple channels within the Aleutian Island chain. Waters entering eastward of about 175  degrees E tend to flow toward the east, then north, with some of the waters passing northward through the Bering Strait and others continuing counterclockwise around the cyclonic Bering Gyre. Along the Kamchatka Peninsula, the waters form the East Kamchatka Current, which flows southwestward out of the Bering Sea through the deep passes between Kamchatka and the western Aleutian Islands <a href="Fig2-3.htm">(Figure 2-3)</a>. [These general circulation patterns in the Bering Sea are based on observations from April through October (Coachman, 1980).]<P>	In the Sea of Okhotsk, water circulation is dominated by the cyclonic flow in the Okhotsk Gyre. Pacific waters enter the sea through channels in the eastern Kuril chain, flow northward along the Kamchatka Peninsula, and continue approximately parallel to the coastline, finally exiting the sea by moving southward through the western Kurils <a href="Fig2-3.htm">(Figure 2-3)</a>. Flow along the coast is also influenced locally by the many river inflows.<P><center><a href="Arc2-2.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc2-4.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a></center><p><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

CAMPBELL</FONT></center><P><BR><B>2.4 Ocean Temperatures And Salinities</B><P>	Significant horizontal variation in surface water properties exists throughout the Arctic and surrounding ocean regions as a result of counteracting inflows of cold fresh waters from coastal runoff and warm saline waters from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Seasonally averaged surface salinities are presented in <a href="Fig2-4.htm">Figure 2-4</a>. The salinities are relatively low in the Arctic Ocean, averaging about 30 parts per thousand compared with values of about 33 parts per thousand in the northern North Pacific and about 35 parts per thousand in the northern North Atlantic. Partially as a result of the freshwater river inflows and the relatively high salinities in the Atlantic and the Pacific, the general trend in Arctic surface salinities is from low values of about 27 parts per thousand along the Siberian coast south of Novosibirskiye and along the northern Alaskan coast to high values of about 34 parts per thousand at the North Atlantic boundary of the ocean. The local high of about 32 parts per thousand just northward of the Bering Strait results from the influence of the surface water flow from the Bering Sea. Salinities in the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk, both affected by significant Pacific inflows, are generally 31 to 33 parts per thousand, with the lower salinities correlating positively with the continental shelf regions and being more prevalent in summer than in winter.<P>	The largely enclosed Hudson Bay has significantly lower salinities than the rest of the region of interest, increasing from below 27 parts per thousand in the south to about 31 parts per thousand in the north, where the passages outward to the wider ocean exist. In Baffin Bay/Davis Strait, salinities are relatively low in the center of the bay and increase southward to the pronounced indentation of higher salinities from the Atlantic waters in the West Greenland Current. Salinities are low along the east coasts of Greenland and Newfoundland because of the transport of melting ice by the East Greenland and Labrador Currents.<P>	Ocean surface temperatures show a pronounced seasonal cycle and marked spatial variations <a href="Fig2-5.htm">(Figure 2-5)</a>. The Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current maintain relatively high temperatures in the northern North Atlantic throughout the year, with the average monthly temperatures being lowest in March and highest in August. Warm North Atlantic waters enter the Davis Strait/Baffin Bay region through the West Greenland Current, whereas warm North Pacific waters enter the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk through numerous passages in the eastern Aleutian Island and eastern Kuril Island chains. The sharpest seasonal temperature contrasts, in the regions containing sea ice, occur in the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk, with ocean surface temperatures ranging from freezing to above 283 K. Minimum monthly averaged temperatures occur in February in the Bering Sea and in April in the Sea of Okhotsk, whereas maximum temperatures occur in August in the Bering Sea and in September in the Sea of Okhotsk.<P>	In much of the Arctic Ocean, a relatively uniform upper mixed layer with a depth of 30 to 50 meters overlies a very stable density structure down to a depth of about 200 meters. This stable structure is a result of the strong increase of salinity with depth, especially in the Eurasian Basin, where the salinity is 34.9 to 35.0 parts per thousand at 200 meters. Temperatures are generally less than -1.5  degrees C at depths between 0 and 100 meters and increase to 0  degrees C at about 200 meters (Aagaard, 1980). The density structure is a significant factor for sea ice growth because the stable stratification implies that the convective depth to which cooling occurs before freezing commences at the surface is generally not large, and the heat and salt from the waters underneath the top 200 meters generally do not upwell to the surface. Hence the surface waters, influenced also by the freshwater river inflows, remain relatively fresh and cold.<P><BR><center><a href="Arc2-5.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc2-5.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a></center><p><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

Energy balance studies of the Earth-atmosphere system using satellite observations indicate a net radiative energy gain equatorward of 35- degrees  latitude and a net radiative energy loss poleward of this latitude. Although the incoming radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere in the polar regions during summer can be as large as in the tropics, the perennial Arctic ice cover reflects much of the incoming radiation back to space. To maintain regional heat balances, the surplus energy at low latitudes must be transported poleward to regions of radiative energy deficit. About 60 percent of this poleward energy transport occurs within the atmosphere, and the remainder occurs within the oceans. The chief heat-transport mechanisms of the atmosphere include mean meridional circulations, thought to be most important between the Equator and 30- degrees  latitude, and horizontal transports resulting from eddies, more effective at mid and high latitudes. The Arctic region is thereby influenced by the energetic subpolar systems transporting heat and momentum into the region, and it in turn influences the general circulation of the atmosphere by being a heat sink for the global weather machine (Vowinckel and Orvig, 1970).<P><BR><center><a href="Arc2-4.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc2-6.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a></center><p><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

PARKINSON, JOSEFINO C. COMISO, H. JAY ZWALLY,<BR> DONALD J. CAVALIERI, PER GLOERSEN, WILLIAM J. CAMPBELL</FONT></center><P><BR><B>2.6  Atmospheric Temperatures, Pressures, And Winds</B><P>	Monthly climatological fields of atmospheric surface temperatures, sea-level pressures, and geostrophic winds for the region poleward of 50   degrees N, created from the climatological data set of Crutcher and Meserve (1970), are presented in Figures 2-6 through 2-8. The pressure and temperature maps exhibit two distinct seasonal patterns. In winter, a bipolar pattern of pressure and temperature results from the bipolar distribution of land and ocean and the consequent contrast in thermal forcing: pressures are relatively high and temperatures are relatively low over the land versus over the oceans. Smaller-scale factors also influence the pressure and temperature distributions, with, for example, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current influencing the position of the low-pressure region to the southwest of Iceland in October through April (the Icelandic Low). The other major low-pressure system visible in the winter maps is the Aleutian Low in the vicinity of the Aleutian Islands in the northern North Pacific. In summer, the temperature and pressure distributions are more symmetric, reflecting the meridional temperature difference between the ice-covered central Arctic Ocean and the warm continental land surfaces around the perimeter.<P>	The wintertime asymmetric surface air temperature distribution revealed in <a href="Fig2-6.htm">Figure 2-6</a> is determined partly by the radiative properties of the underlying surface. The surface albedo, or fraction of incident solar radiation reflected at the surface, varies strongly with surface type (Grenfell and Maykut, 1977; Robock, 1980; Barry, 1983; Henderson-Sellers and Wilson, 1983). Depending on the season, from 60 to 90 percent of the incoming solar radiation reaching the Arctic surface overall is reflected back (Lamb, 1982). During fall and winter, the albedo increases, to a point, with increasing ice thickness and snow cover. Young sea ice 1-centimeter thick has an albedo of about 0.1, whereas ice 1-meter thick has an albedo of about 0.8. As the ice further thickens from 1 meter to 3 meters, there is only a slight increase in albedo (Grenfell, 1983). Freshly fallen snow has an albedo as high as 98 percent (Vowinckel and Orvig, 1970), although albedos as low as 20 to 30 percent have been recorded over wet, dirty snow (Warren and Wiscombe, 1980). A representative range of albedos for ice-free ocean is 10 to 15 percent (Lamb, 1982). During summer, the overall albedo is greatly reduced over that during winter because of the greater amount of open water and the presence of wet snow and melt ponds on the ice. The albedo of melt ponds varies with the thickness and the underlying ice type but ranges from about 20 to about 60 percent (Grenfell and Maykut, 1977).<P>	Near-surface Arctic atmospheric temperatures are characterized through most of the year by a strong temperature inversion, with air temperatures increasing rather than decreasing with height. This inversion results mainly from the negative surface energy balance. The depth of the inversion depends on the amount of cloud cover, near-surface turbulence, and warm-air advection from lower latitudes and may reach about 2 kilometers into the atmosphere. Changes in these factors will at times destroy the inversion layer, sometimes temporarily increasing the winter surface temperature by as much as 30 K (Vowinckel and Orvig, 1970).<P>	During the midwinter month of February, the temperatures across the ice-covered Arctic Basin range from 235 K north of the Canadian Archipelago to 250 K in the Chukchi and Kara Seas. As the Sun's elevation increases in the spring, the land masses warm and the temperature distribution becomes more symmetric about the pole, with the exception of the Greenland ice cap. By July, the temperature across the Arctic is fairly uniform at 275 +/- 2.5 K, just a few degrees above freezing. In September, cooling initiates the return to the more asymmetric wintertime distribution. The annual spread of the mean latitudinal position of the freezing line (273.15 K isotherm) is approximately 22 degrees, ranging from a mean summer latitude of 78 degrees N to a mean winter latitude of 56 degrees N (Holcombe, 1958).<P>	The January climatological sea-level pressure map shows the dominance of the Icelandic Low in the northern North Atlantic and the eastern Arctic regions (<a href="Fig2-7.htm">Figure 2-7a</a>). The 1010-millibar contour associated with this system extends westward to eastern Canada and northeastward to Scandinavia and Novaya Zemlya. In the western Arctic, the high-pressure system over Siberia is connected to a smaller high situated over northwestern Canada by a high-pressure bridge that additionally separates the Icelandic Low from the Aleutian Low. The Aleutian Low and Siberian High dominate the circulation over the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk regions. This pattern of two low-pressure and two high-pressure systems over the north polar region is maintained until May, when the monthly average pressure field becomes more uniform and symmetric. By June the range in mean sea-level pressure across the Arctic is almost a factor of 3 less than in January, and throughout the summer months there are no well-defined systems except the persistent high pressure over the central Arctic Basin. By October a high-pressure ridge begins to form over the Asian land mass, and the low-pressure areas in the vicinity of Iceland and the Aleutian Islands begin to intensify. By December the winter pattern is well established.<P>	Monthly mean geostrophic winds based on the pressure distributions shown in <a href="Fig2-7.htm">Figure 2-7</a> are presented in <a href="Fig2-8.htm">Figure 2-8</a>. In the Northern Hemisphere the geostrophic wind, which results from a balance between the pressure gradient and Coriolis forces (in the absence of friction), is directed counterclockwise around a low-pressure system and clockwise around a high-pressure system, with a speed proportional to the pressure gradient. During the winter months of January and February, the strongest mean monthly winds are found along the coastal regions of the North Pacific and are associated with the semipermanent low centered over the Aleutian Islands. The so-called "polar easterlies" are not hemispheric in extent but are found poleward of the Icelandic and Aleutian Lows. Over the central Arctic Basins monthly average winter winds are weaker than over the adjacent seas. As the intensity of the semipermanent pressure systems decreases in the transition months of March, April, and May, the winds weaken on average, but the contrast between the still cold surface of the Arctic pack ice and the warmer continents and open-water areas contributes to creating a frontal zone along the northern shores of Siberia, Alaska, and Canada (Reed, 1960). Intense low-pressure systems move eastward along this zone, termed the Siberian-Canadian Arctic Front, bringing heat and moisture to the Arctic region.<P><BR><centeR><a href="Arc2-5.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a><a href="Arc2-7.htm"><img src="../forward.gif" border=0></a></center><p><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

CAMPBELL</FONT></center><P><BR><B>2.7 Synoptic Characteristics Of The Arctic Atmosphere</B><p><DD>Synoptic weather charts of the Arctic, which show the distribution of cyclones (low-pressure systems) and anticyclones (high-pressure systems) at a given time, can differ considerably from the monthly mean climatological maps presented in <a href="Fig2-7.htm">Figure 2-7</A>, especially during winter, when the weather patterns are often dominated by intense, rapidly moving low-pressure systems. For instance, the semipermanent Icelandic and Aleutian Lows discussed in <a href="Arc2-6.htm">Section 2.6</A> reflect the frequent passage of individual transient systems.<P><DD>	Long-term synoptic observations have provided data for mapping the intensity and frequency of cyclones and anticyclones. <a href="Fig2-9.htm">Figure 2-9</a>, redrawn from Palmen and Newton (1969), shows the location of the maximum frequency of cyclone and anticyclone tracks, the axis of mean maximum wind, and the mean sea-level pressure in the principal semipermanent high- and low-pressure centers for the winter months. At high latitudes, there are two principal axes of maximum cyclone frequency, one located in the Pacific and the other in the Atlantic. In the North American sector, an axis over eastern Canada converges with a second axis along the east coast of the continent. The point of convergence is in the vicinity of Iceland, defining the Icelandic Low. These cyclones penetrate the Arctic region along a track that follows the ice-free waters of the Norwegian Sea and then progresses into the Barents Sea along the Eurasian coast. In the Pacific, two axes of maximum frequency track northeastward and converge in the vicinity of the Aleutian Island chain, defining the semipermanent Aleutian Low. The curve of maximum frequency of cyclones then proceeds into the Gulf of Alaska and moves southward along the west coast of North America. The maximum frequency of anticyclones at Arctic latitudes is confined to the North American and Eurasian land masses. These systems are more quiescent than the cyclonic depressions.<P><DD>	During summer, eastward-moving cyclones follow the Siberian, Canadian, and Alaskan coasts, bringing rain and snow. These systems are associated with the Siberian-Canadian Arctic Front, which, as noted earlier, results in part from the contrast between the warm continents and the colder ocean surface and perennial ice cover of the central Arctic (Reed, 1960). Anticyclones form more frequently over the ice in spring and summer and are not simply extensions of the continental areas of divergence as is generally true in winter.<P><BR><centeR><a href="Arc2-6.htm"><img src="../back.gif" border=0></a><a href="ArcIndex.htm"><img src="../home.gif" border=0></a></center><p><B>To Return to the Observatory, Quit This Browser </B><P>

Snow and ice properties</I></B></P><P>Details of the snow and ice properties and the processes that influence them are essential for understanding the factors that influence the ice-albedo feedback.  A major goal of SHEBA is to describe from observations and reproduce from models the evolution of the ice thickness distribution and the associated ice physical characteristics for an area of approximately (10 km)2 in the vicinity of the ice camp.</P><P>Given the necessary forcing at the ice interfaces, an ice model that can reproduce the ice thickness distribution and associated ice physical characteristics would include the following processes: ice divergence, ridging processes, lead formation, water storage, formation of new ice in leads, distinction between first-year and multi-year ice (in terms of salinity and air bubbles), evolution of melt ponds, radiative transfer in the ice, evolution of snow characteristics, and accurate determination of interfacial turbulent fluxes for the aggregate of ice thicknesses and surface characteristics.   Treatment of these  processes in larger-scale models is presently crude, at best.  Specific questions related to snow and ice physical processes include:</P><UL><LI>How do the changes in ice ablation and accretion vary with ice age and thickness, snow cover, ponding, and ridging?<LI>What is the minimum ice thickness that can survive the summer melt season, and how does this influence ice concentration?<LI>How is the disposition of solar radiation among surface absorption, internal absorption and transmission affected by ice physical properties, ice thickness, snow cover, ponding, particulates, and biological activity?<LI>What are the properties and evolution of highly scattering surface layers on hummocks, multi-year ice and  drained first-year ice?<LI> How do melt pond properties evolve over the melt season and what is the relative importance of water drainage, runoff into leads, and melt water that is left to freeze in fall?<LI>What is the relative importance of local thermodynamics, wind redistribution, and ridging in determining the local amount of snow?<LI>What is the relative importance of divergence, ridging, and lateral melting in determining the lead fraction and size distribution over the annual cycle?<LI>Are there relationships between snow cover, ice topography and melt pond distribution?<LI>What is the thermal and mechanical evolution of a newly-formed ridge over an annual cycle?</UL><P>The overall goal of the ice-related measurements is to quantify critical processes that control the ice thickness distribution and associated ice physical characteristics, and determine the ice mass balance for the main floe.  The ice measurements should be obtained as close as possible to the surface flux sites. Many of the measurements must be obtained at a number of sites, chosen to represent the  snow and ice conditions in the vicinity of the  SHEBA ice camp. The following measurements in the ice will be made:</P><UL><LI>vertical profiles of salinity, temperature, density and air  volume in snow and ice<LI>time series of vertical profiles of internal ice temperature<LI>spatial and temporal variations in the size, geometry and distribution of air bubbles, brine pockets and drainage tubes<LI>distribution, concentration and type of particulates present in  the snow and primary ice types<LI>surface and underice topography at the primary floe <LI>snow depth and density surveys  <LI>time-series of ablation/accumulation at upper surface and ice bottom<LI>lateral ablation/erosion rates around perimeter of main floe<LI>surveys of melt pond areal extent and volume <LI>pond evolution studies measuring changes in depth, area, volume and thermohaline structure <LI>determination of pond water drainage and surface water transport<LI>fresh water input/accumulation in the ocean mixed layer<LI>time series of the reflection, absorption and transmission of solar radiation<LI>determination of the optical properties of the snow and major ice types, including radiance distribution at several levels inside the snow and ice.</UL><P>Changes in the physical properties of the ice will be monitored  at each of the heat and mass balance sites throughout the annual cycle.  Intensive measurements during the melt season are required due to the presence of melt ponds and highly variable optical properties. Detailed monitoring of ice morphology will be conducted on the  local scale.  Surface topography will be measured before, during, and  after the melt season.  In addition, a series of ice thickness  surveys will be made on the primary floe.  Frequent aerial photography of the primary floe and nearby areas will be needed to document the rapid morphological changes that occur during the summer. </P>

Heat flux components at the atmosphere/surface interface may be vastly different over different ice types.  For example, the surface albedo varies widely between ponded and unponded ice.  In winter, the sensible heat flux through leads is two orders of magnitude greater than the flux over thick ice.  Objectives of the surface flux program are thus to: a) measure each component of the surface energy balance at a set of sites that represent the variety of surface types present; and b) aggregate these fluxes as averages and distributions weighted by the area covered by each surface type. The surface flux data will be used in radiative transfer models, 1-D cloudy boundary layer models, ice mass flux studies, and upper ocean heat and salt balance studies.  The surface flux measurements are needed to address the following scientific issues:</P><UL><LI> How does the heterogeneity of the surface associated with the ice thickness distribution  influence the surface energy balance?<LI>What are the impacts of clouds on surface temperature, albedo, and fluxes of radiation, sensible heat, and latent heat?<LI>How do the optical properties of the Arctic surface interact with changes in snow characteristics, ice physical properties, thinning of the ice, and melt pond formation?</UL><P>Detailed measurements made at the surface over ice with different characteristics must be translated into a physical understanding that can result in a determination of the statistical aggregate of each heat flux component over the distribution of ice and surface characteristics.  Given a distribution of surface properties and ice thickness over a region of scale tens of kilometers, ancillary atmospheric information (such as atmospheric temperature, humidity, wind, and cloud characteristics) can be used to determine the corresponding distribution of the components of the surface fluxes over the region.  Because of the nonlinearities in the determination of the heat flux components, substantial errors in determination of the radiation and turbulent heat fluxes are possible if areally-averaged ice characteristics are used in the evaluation of the flux components and the surface heterogeneity is not accounted for.</P><P>Each of the components of the surface energy balance will be measured, including the radiative and turbulent fluxes.  Many of the measurements will need to be obtained over a number of sites, chosen to represent the variety of snow and ice surface conditions in the vicinity of the  SHEBA ice camp.  Sites will include: first-year and multi-year ice, blue ice, white ice, ridges, melt ponds and leads.</P><P>Measurements to be obtained at the flux stations include:</P><UL><LI> downward spectral irradiances (shortwave and longwave), the longwave measurements extending to 400 cm-1  (main flux station only)<LI> spectrally integrated downward longwave and shortwave fluxes<LI> surface layer wind speeds, air temperature, and water vapor mixing ratio<LI> covariances of heat, moisture, and velocity components<LI> radiometric "skin" surface temperature<LI> spectral and wavelength-integrated albedo<LI> bidirectional reflectances<LI> rainfall and snowfall rates</UL>

These measurements are essential for understanding the physical processes that determine the cloud-radiation feedback. The atmospheric data collected at the ice camp in conjunction with the ARM program will be used in radiative transfer models, 1-D cloudy boundary layer models, single-column GCM experiments, and will be integrated with mesoscale and larger-scale datasets in 3-D analysis and modeling efforts.

Upper ocean properties </I></B> </P><P>The annual cycle of salt and heat exchange between the ice and ocean is an important factor in the ice mass balance and for the most part determines ocean buoyancy characteristics (Figure 2). Momentum flux from shear between the ice and ocean, along with buoyancy flux from melting and freezing, determine turbulent entrainment of heat and salt into the mixed layer from the stratified ocean below. The ice thickness distribution plays an important role in this exchange, by controlling upper ocean heating rates and the rate of salt rejection from ice forming in leads and consolidating in pressure-ridge keels. Accurately describing these complex interactions requires coupled models which account for variation in surface fluxes associated with the different ice thickness categories and dynamics, along with their impact on turbulent transfer in the boundary layer.</P><P>Specific scientific questions to be addressed by the observational measuring program related to the ice/ocean interface and upper ocean characteristics include:</P><UL> <LI>What are the fluxes of momentum, heat, and salt at the ice/ocean interface in the central Arctic, and how do they vary over the annual cycle?<LI>How do mean properties (velocity, temperature, salinity) of the mixed layer respond to surface fluxes, and what are the proper parameterizations relating mean properties to turbulent fluxes?<LI>How representative are fluxes measured at varying levels at a single location of a surrounding region encompassing many ice thickness and roughness types?<LI>What controls exchange between the mixed layer and denser water below? What are the mechanisms governing shoaling and freshening of the mixed layer during the melt season, and deepening and salination during freeze-up? <LI>How is solar heating of the mixed layer distributed within leads and in the upper ocean?  How is heat from summer insolation stored in the mixed layer, and how important is it relative to oceanic heat conducted from below the mixed layer?<LI>How is the underside of the ice modified by contact with the ocean?  How are roughness scales for momentum and scalar properties (i.e., drag and exchange coefficients) quantified in terms of the thickness distribution?<LI>How does biological activity, or other sources of turbidity, affect absorption of solar energy in the ice/upper ocean system?</UL><P>Our plan is to address these questions by combining a Continuos Core Measurement program with shorter, intensive process studies.  The CCM emphasizes monitoring of vertical fluxes of heat, salt, momentum, plus radiative fluxes in the oceanic mixed layer beneath the manned camp, and relating the fluxes to the evolution of simultaneously measured mean mixed layer properties. Measurement systems will operate continuously for the duration of the experiment and provide most of the information needed for a first-order characterization of how the ocean at one particular location affects the surface heat balance. The following time-series measurements in the ocean are recommended for the CCM program:</P><UL><LI>three-dimensional velocity, temperature, and salinity at several levels in the upper ocean, with adequate resolution to determine the Reynolds fluxes by direct covariance techniques<LI>profiles of temperature and salinity in the upper 600 m, with periodic water samples <LI>microstructure observations of boundary layer and pycnocline turbulent kinetic energy and thermal dissipation rates<LI>optical transmissivity in leads and the upper 30 m of the ocean</UL><P>Process studies address issues of representativeness of the CCM measurements, and the impact of leads on upper ocean fluxes.  Leads and thin ice provide windows in an otherwise highly reflective and insulating cover, and  play a crucial role in the exchange of heat, salt, and mass between the ice and upper ocean in all seasons.  While recent studies have elucidated many features of lead dynamics in the late winter period, we still lack knowledge of the mixing dynamics in summer leads, the impact of freezing and unstable buoyancy flux during fall freeze-up, and the importance of frazil production during the winter night.  Recent developments in autonomous-underwater-vehicle (AUV) technology, rapid-deployment, portable mast and profiling systems, and remote current sensing techniques make such measurements feasible.</P><P>The following process studies will directly address SHEBA goals:</P><UL><LI>Horizontal variability of turbulent fluxes. The study will include direct flux measurements under different ice types, and horizontal finestructure transects on scales of several kilometers. <LI>Summer lead study. Investigate the disposition of solar input to leads during summer melting, including downward turbulent heat flux, radiative flux extinction, cross-lead microstructure transects. This will be done in close cooperation with the ice program.<LI>Fall lead study.  Similar to the summer study, but aimed at capturing the transition from stable to statically unstable boundary layer conditions as widespread freezing occurs.<LI>Winter lead study.  A modest program aimed at understanding frazil production in the absence of any solar heating, coordinated with the aircraft observations of leads.</UL>

<body bgcolor="FFFFFF"><A NAME="executive"> <A HREF="home.htm">Return to Table of Contents</A></A><H4 align=center>Executive Summary</H4><P>SHEBA is a research program designed to document and understand the physical processes that couple the atmosphere, ice, and ocean in the Arctic.  The goals of the program are to use this increased understanding to improve the treatment of the arctic climate in global models and to enhance the observation and analysis of arctic climate by developing more accurate remote sensing techniques. The central theme of SHEBA emerges from issues related to the surface energy balance, especially the ice-albedo and cloud-radiation climate feedback mechanisms.  The SHEBA program is based on the premise that improved understanding of the physical processes involved in air-sea-ice interactions is needed to address the issues of climate feedback in the Arctic and to improve our ability to model the arctic climate.<P><P>The essence of SHEBA as a project is to conduct a field experiment at a drifting station on the pack ice of the Arctic Ocean for a year (starting Spring 1997), in combination with remote sensing and modeling analyses of the entire Arctic Basin. The observational program emphasizes the physical processes associated with interactions among the radiation balance, mass changes of the sea ice, storage and retrieval of energy and salt in the mixed layer of the ocean, and the formation of clouds and their influence on the surface energy balance.  SHEBA will provide an opportunity to improve our understanding of the relationships between the air-sea-ice system and the signals received by satellite-borne remote sensors. The modeling effort aims to improve the parameterizations of crucial  air-sea-ice interactive processes in climate models.  The primary focus is on processes that determine the ice-albedo feedback and the cloud-radiation feedback.  Both in situ and remotely-sensed data are needed for this effort.</P><P>The timeliness of SHEBA derives from the recognition of a well-defined set of problems, the needed improvement of model physics and satellite retrievals, a need to clarify the role of high latitudes in global climate on various time scales, the availability of new observational technology, and a shared motivation with several other programs. Primary sponsorship of SHEBA is provided by the National Science Foundation Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) High Latitude Program.  In addition, SHEBA is being designed in collaboration with the Submarine Science Ice Experiment (SCICEX), sponsored by a consortium of federal agencies led by ONR, the First ISCCP Regional Experiment III (FIRE III), sponsored principally by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program.  International collaboration is coordinated under the auspices of the Arctic Climate System Study (ACSYS) of the World Climate Research Programme.</P><P>This document describes the scientific objectives of the SHEBA program and a strategy for achieving them.  The intended audience includes potential SHEBA principal investigators,  agency program managers, operations and logistics managers, and others with an interest in the arctic climate.   The purpose of the document is to provide a statement of the nature and scope of the SHEBA program, including priorities for the implementation of SHEBA.</P><P>The document is based on contributions from and discussion among the members of the SHEBA Science Working Group (SWG).  The SWG is a multi-disciplinary group with expertise in atmospheric, oceanic  and sea ice science, charged with developing plans for SHEBA based on input from the scientific community.  The scientific background and rationale for SHEBA is developed in a Prospectus, available from the SHEBA Project Office.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Ashland Accounting Services, </B>is the industry
leader in providing independent AIMR compliance verification to the finance
industry. Our client list spans the globe and our name recognition extends
to trustees and consultants across the country. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Money managers live in a 24 hour world, and so
does Ashland Accounting. We are available whenever our clients need us,
so when that RFP due date is tomorrow, you know that you'll have those
numbers verified in time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">We have worked with over 350 composites in almost
every investment style, and we have the answers to the compliance issues
facing our clients. We invest as much time in consulting with our clients
as we do in verifying their numbers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">We don't bill by the hour because our goal is
to expedite the compliance reporting process. We bill on a per composite
basis, with no additional charges for phone calls or meetings because we
are committed to providing a level of client servicing unavailable from
any of our competition. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">When we visit your office, we know what we are
looking for. Our objective is to get the job done with a minimal amount
of drain on you and your staff. Each client is given individual attention.
You can count on the same person who is answering your questions over the
phone, to be there conducting the due diligence in your office, and finishing
up that last-minute work for the RFP due tomorrow.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="One"></A><B><I>1. How does the &quot;white book,&quot; AIMR
Performance Presentation Standards 1993, compare to previous publications
pertaining to the compliance requirements?</I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The publication:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI>integrates the Implementation Report of December 1991,</LI>

<LI>summarizes the work completed in 1992 that had previously been published
in separate documents,</LI>

<LI>includes the report of the International Subcommittee,</LI>

<LI>discusses the criteria for excluding from composites portfolios below
a minimum asset size, and requires the manager to report an asset-weighted
management fee whenever net-of-management fee results are presented.</LI>
</UL>

<P>There are also two new important date changes concerning the compliance
requirements: the implementation dates for bringing taxable portfolios
and non-U.S. and non-Canadian portfolios into compliance have been extended
to January 1, 1994.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>2. Does the implementation date extension for taxable portfolios
to January 1,1994, mean that a firm can be in compliance as of 1993 for
its tax exempt portfolios, and as of 1994 for its taxable portfolios? Or,
does the one-year extension mean that managers have another year to work
on 1993 compliance for taxable portfolios?</I></B></P>

<P>The deadline extension for taxable portfolios means that a manager can
claim compliance for tax exempt portfolios as of January 1, 1993, and for
taxable portfolios as of January 1, 1994. The effective date of a manager's
compliance for tax exempt and for taxable portfolios must be disclosed.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>3. Can a firm claim that its international portfolios are in compliance
as of 1993 by fulfilling the domestic requirements? </I></B></P>

<P>If a manager has implemented all of the domestic requirements for non-U.S.
and non-Canadian portfolios as of January 1, 1993, the claim of compliance
can be made. When managers claim compliance for international assets and
clients as of January 1, 1994, the additional requirements and disclosures
will apply.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>4. If a firm is purchased for the purpose of bringing on staff
and resources to offer a product specific to the acquired firm but new
to the acquiring firm, can the acquiring firm show the past performance
record of the acquired firm as its own and still claim compliance?</I></B></P>

<P>The rules of portability will apply, i.e., if all the investment decision
makers and substantially all the assets come with the acquired firm, and
if the staff and decision making process remain intact and independent,
the performance record of the acquired firm for that product can be shown
as the performance record of the acquiring firm and can be linked to on
going results. If, however , the staff of the two merged firms are combined,
and the decision making is shared, the performance record of the acquired
firm would be presented as supplemental information, and must not be linked
to ongoing results.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>5. If a firm has been in existence prior to 1993, can the firm
claim compliance as of January 1, 1995?</I></B></P>

<P>The Standards require that all portfolios invested in US and/or Canadian
securities managed for US-based or Canada-based clients must be presented
in composites that adhere to the AIMR Standards to claim compliance as
of January 1, 1993, or before, if a firm has been in existence at least
since 1993. Taxable portfolios and investment in non-US and non-Canadian
securities must be brought into compliance as of January 1, 1994, or before,
as long as the firm had been in existence since at least 1994. If a firm
does not have records to substantiate performance after 1993 or 1994, it
could come into compliance if the lack of records is disclosed. Lack of
records for periods after 1993 or 1994 means that due to circumstances
beyond the control of the manager, the underlying data to support the performance
record were either never kept or were lost or destroyed.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>6. If a firm that is in existence prior to 1993 cannot come into
compliance until sometime after the implementation date of 1993 and 1994
for reasons other than lack of records, when can the firm claim compliance?</I></B></P>

<P>If a firm comes into compliance after 1993 or 1994, the firm must be
able to present a 10-year record in compliance before the claim of compliance
can be made. For example, a firm founded in 1990 but doe not come into
compliance until 1996. The firm may claim compliance with the standards
once it has achieved a ten-year record in compliance with the standards,
which in this case would be in the year 2006.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><A NAME="Seven"></A><B><I>7. If a firm cannot meet the technical requirements
of the standards, can the firm claim compliance? </I></B></P>

<P>No. The Standards set forth minimum requirements and disclosures that
must be met to make the claim of compliance. If fact, because these are
minimum requirements, it may be necessary for a manager to provide more
information to meet the full ethical intent of the standards. It was never
intended that the spirit of full disclosure and fair representation be
replaced by a list of technical requirement. To that end, the number of
technical requirements has been purposefully kept to a minimum.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><I>8. Is the statement &quot;calculated in accordance with AIMR Performance
Presentation Standards?&quot; acceptable when only referring to the methodology
of performance calculations? </I></B></P>

<P>No. This statement would lead one to assume that performance results
being presented are in compliance with AIMR's Performance Presentation
Standards, when the statement is actually explaining the use of a time-weighted,
total rate of return calculation. To claim compliance with AIMR's Performance
Presentation Standards firms must meet all the requirements and mandatory
disclosures and any other additional requirements or disclosures necessary
to that firm's specific situation. An analyst may use the following legend
only after every reasonable effort is made to ensure that performance is
in compliance with the PPS in all material respects: </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="Nine"></A><B><I>9. Our bank was very close to completing a
lengthy and expensive process of bringing all our tax-exempt assets into
compliance with the AIMR Standards as of January 1, 1993 and taxable assets
into compliance as of January 1, 1994. Just prior to completing these compliance
requirement, our bank acquired another entity whose assets are not in compliance.
Is there some sort of grace period that will be allowed after making such
an acquisition? Or, will we have to postpone making a claim of compliance
for the efforts we have already completed until the acquired assets are
also brought into compliance? </I></B></P>

<P>This situation represents three main areas of consideration:</P>

<P>1. The time frame for assimilating acquired assets into a framework
that can meet AIMR compliance requirements.</P>

<P>2. Systems problems, i.e., integrating accounts that may be evaluated
through different portfolio management, accounting and/or performance measurement
systems.</P>

<P>3. Recommended disclosures in the case of an acquisition.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Assimilating Assets</B></P>

<P>If the acquired accounts are to be transitioned into the investment
style and strategy of the acquiring firm, they should be treated as new
accounts and placed in a composite labeled &quot;acquisition of XYZ&quot;
until such time as the assets can be blended over time into compliance.
The acquiring firm will need to set reasonable and consistently applied
criteria that is well documented for determining when the acquired assets
complete the transition to the new style. Some accounts will be modified
more quickly than others. Therefore, rather than setting one arbitrary
time frame for bringing all acquired assets into existing composites that
meet compliance requirements, different portfolios can transition at different
times as long as the criteria are consistently followed. The historical
performance records for these strategies will be those of the acquiring
firm. Availability of the records of the acquired firm must be disclosed
and provided upon request, even though the strategies have been discontinued.</P>

<P>If the investment style and strategy of the acquiring firm is to be
maintained and its accounts represent separate composites, the assets of
the acquired firm must meet compliance requirements as of the first full
reporting period one year after the acquisition date, for a firm to claim
compliance. In other words, there will be a one-year grace period for bringing
the acquired assets into compliance if the strategies of the acquired assets
are to be maintained. For example, if the assets are acquired in mid-July,
the assets would need to meet compliance requirements as of the beginning
of the fourth quarter of the following year. The historical performance
records for these strategies will be those of the acquired firm.</P>

<P>To claim compliance, taxable assets must meet compliance requirements
by at least January 1, 1994; tax-exempt assets must meet compliance requirements
by at least January 1, 1993. Prior periods to do not have to be in compliance,
as long as this is disclosed, with an explanation of how the past is not
in compliance. If an historical record, even an historical record that
does not meet compliance requirements, is not available because underlying
records were not maintained or because performance was not calculated,
this must be disclosed. For periods after January 1, 1993 for tax-exempt,
and January 1, 1994 for taxable assets, a lack of performance calculations
cannot be disclosed as a means of claming compliance. After these dates,
only the absence of underlying records can be used as a basis for not meeting
compliance requirements, and the absence of such records must be disclosed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Systems Problems</B></P>

<P>The AIMR Implementation Committee has discussed the problems of integrating
different portfolio management, accounting and performance measurement
systems for different branches or subsidiaries or for different types of
assets or client groups. While recognizing the practical problems and costs
of integrating systems or of initiating performance measurements of portfolios,
the Committee has determined that compliance with the AIMR Standards require
investment in the necessary systems to evaluate portfolio performance.
Therefore, systems incompatibilities cannot be used as a reason for not
claiming compliance for all assets, i.e., a manager cannot make the claim
of compliance for only those assets that are measured and monitored on
compatible systems. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Disclosures</B></P>

<P>It is recommended, rather than required, that an acquiring firm disclose
when an acquisition is made, the amount of assets and the number of portfolios
involved. As the new assets are brought into compliance, prospective clients
will see an increase in the size of assets and number of portfolios through
the required composite disclosures. Therefore, full disclosure of acquisitions
is in the best interests of both the prospective client and the acquiring
firm. </P>

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><A NAME="Ten"></A><B><I>10. May consultants, plan sponsors and software
vendors claim compliance with the AIMR Performance Presentation Standards.
Is this appropriate and are they able to make the claim? </I></B></P>

<P>No. Plan sponsors and software vendors can not make the claim of compliance
because they do not present performance results on actual assets under
their management, unless the consultant, plan sponsor or software vendor
actually manage the assets that the AIMR PPS compliance is directed to.
These groups can claim to endorse the Standards and/or require that their
managers claim compliance.</P>

<P><A NAME="One"></A><B><I>1. Audit, Attest, Verify...What's the difference?
</I></B></P>

<P>The AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) developed
auditing standards to guide CPAs conducting financial statement audits.
The word audit is primarily associated with financial statements. </P>

<P>Even so, auditing standards are also used as guidelines by CPAs expressing
opinions on nonfinancial statement data. These audits are called attestation
engagements. In 1992, the AICPA issued standards for attestation engagements
separate from auditing standards, further differentiating between the two
terms. </P>

<P>In 1993, the AIMR (Association for Investment Management and Research)
issued Performance Presentation Standards, recommending compliance verification
and establishing criteria for Level 1 and Level 2 verifications. The term
belongs to AIMR, not the AICPA. </P>

<P>CPAs must look to AIMR's PPS when conducting verifications and to the
AICPA's attestation standards for guidelines within their own profession.
</P>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><A NAME="Two"></A><B><I>2. Can AAS clients legally state that their
composites are audited? </I></B></P>

<P>Yes. If a CPA is conducting Level 2 verifications on your composites,
you can legally say your composites are audited. But please don't (unless
asked by a consultant). </P>

<P>Verification is the term established by AIMR. It has specific meaning
within the money management industry and among third parties relying on
verifications. For accuracy and consistency, Level 1 or Level 2 verifications
should be called verifications. Period.</P>

<P>Fees are determined by Ashland Accounting Services on a client-by-client
basis. Each investment manager is different and requires different levels
of service. Clients who are not sure about their firm's compliance will
probably pay more than firms that are confident of their compliance, due
to the consulting involved. We discuss all aspects of the firm's compliance
before discussing a fee. On average, Ashland Accounting clients pay $2,500
per year for each Level 1 composite that is presented to potential investors,
and $4,500 per year for each Level 2 composite. The composites which are
not marketed are charged at the rate of $100 per year.[This is the answer
to the question.]</P>

of service. Clients who are not sure about their firm's compliance will
probably pay more than firms that are confident of their compliance, due

<P><A NAME="Three"></A><B><I>3. Must we do a Level 1 audit on all discretionary
composites? </I></B></P>

<P>Yes. A Level 1 verification covers every account under management for
every performance period. This is done to ensure nothing is being &quot;forgotten&quot;,
especially those poor performing accounts! In addition to this, a Level
1 verificaiton includes the inclusion /exclusion of accounts in composites.
It also checks to ensure the composite returns are calculated correctly
and that the portfolio returns are calculated using a correct methodology.
Once the Level 1 verification is conducted, a Level 2 verification can
be conducted on any composite. </P>

<P><A NAME="Four"></A><B><I>4. How much is retroactive verification?</I></B></P>

<P>We look at retroactive verification as one block of time. Because it
is done all at once, it is not as expensive as adding together what each
year's annual fee would be. We competitively bid for retroactive verifications,
but want to ensure the firm has a grasp on all the requirements of retroactive
compliance before giving a bid. On average, our current clients pay approximately
150% of one year's fees.</P>

<P><A NAME="One"></A><B><I>1. The 1991 published Standards, Section VIII.11,
required that balanced-account composites include only accounts for which
the firm has discretion over asset class changes. If the client sets segment
limits from which the firm can not deviate, the segregated assets with
their respective cash positions are included only with their like asset
composite. The 1993 published Standards donoat make reference to this requirement.
Does this still hold?</I></B></P>

<P>Yes. Only balanced portfolios for which the firm has discretion over
the asset mix are to be included in balanced composites. If the firm does
not have discretion over the mix, the segments with their respective cash
positions are included with their like asset composites.</P>

<P><A NAME="Two"></A><B><I>2. What is the recommended treatment for portfolios
that are fully discretionary in the investment sense, but which have unique
investment objectives requiring tailored strategies? Does the AIMR recommend
single-portfolio composites, or can the manager aggregate dissimilar accounts
into a catch-all or &quot;dustbin&quot; composite? </I></B></P>

<P>The Standards require that all discretionary portfolios be included
in one or more appropriate composites defined according to strategy. An
aggregation of portfolios with unique investment characteristics into a
catch-all or dustbin composite will not provide meaningful average performance.
Because the intent of the standards it to account appropriately for all
portfolios, these unique portfolios must remain as single-portfolio composites.
However, a firm need not individually list the single- portfolio composites,
except upon request. An acceptable presentation would be to simply state
on the firm's list of composites the number of such unique portfolios,
the total assets represented by these portfolios, and the percentage of
firms assets. The manager must also include a brief description of the
strategies that typify these portfolios, such as &quot;global portfolios
managed to very specific benchmarks&quot;. The performance results of ny
of the single-portfolio composites must be made available to prospective
clients.</P>

are held until maturity, i.e., the firm is not free to trade securities.
Are these asserts considered non-discretionary and exclude from composites?
The firm also manages fixed income assets with a yield-only strategy. How
is performance to be reported? </I></B></P>

<P>If a firm is not free to trade portfolio securities, the assets are
considered non-discretionary and are to be excluded from firm composites.
If a firm is free to trade the securities, then the assets are considered
discretionary and are to be included in the firm's composites. Performance
of yield-only strategies is required by the Standards to be reported on
a total return basis.</P>

<P><A NAME="Four"></A><B><I>4. Our firm wishes to combine the returns of
European equities and bonds from our EAFE-mandate portfolios. Is this permissible
under the AIMR Standards? </I></B></P>

<P>If a manager &quot;carves out&quot; a geographic segment from a portfolio
invested in international securities, the returns may not be presented
as an AIMR composite unless the sector has its own cash and currency management
(1993 AIMR PPS, Section X.B.1). This carve-out may be presented as supplemental
information, and additional disclosures are required. The manager must
list the composite(s) from which the carve-out is drawn, and must disclose
the percentage of each composite's assets represented by the carve-out.
The appropriateness of combining different types of asset classes by region
will be determined by the underlying strategy.</P>

<P>If the asset allocation at the carve-out level is driven by the asset
allocation guidelines at the total portfolio level, the carve-out of European
stocks and bonds will not be representative of an active asset allocation
decision between European stocks and bonds, and may not be presented as
such. For example, assume that a manager first determines the proportion
of assets to be invested in different asset classes. Within these overall
asset allocation guidelines, the manager may have chosen to underweight
European equities and overweight Japanese equities, and overweight European
bonds and underweight Japanese bonds. Until the overall allocation to equities
is changed, the proportion invested in European equities will be determined
by its relative attractiveness to equities of other regions, not by it
relative attractiveness to European fixed income investments.</P>

<P>If, however, the manager is given a specific amount of assets to be
invested in a particular region, and has discretion to allocate those assets
between stocks and bonds of that region, the carve-out returns would be
representative of an active allocation decision at the segment level. In
this case, the carve-out could be presented on a total return basis at
supplemental information with the required carve-out disclosures. It could
not be presented as an AIMR composite unless it had separate cash and currency
management.</P>

<P><A NAME="Five"></A><B><I>5. If portfolios are managed according to the
same strategy but some portfolios use leverage and some do not, can the
results be combined in a single composite, and what information is required?</I></B></P>

<P>The report of the Subcommittee on Leverage and/or Derivatives that was
published in the Double Issue 1994 (Volume 5, No. 1) of the AMIR Newsletter
required that performance be presented on both a leveraged basis and on
all-cash basis. The all-cash presentation is required as supplemental information.
Portfolios that use leverage may be included in the same composite with
portfolios that do not use leverage as long as the strategies are the same
except for leverage. In this case, the portfolios must be restated to an
all-cash basis, and performance on a leveraged basis in not required. For
example, if the strategy is to pick stocks based on fundamental research
and the leveraged portfolio simply uses margin to always buy the same stocks
in the same relative proportion as the unleveraged portfolio (but totaling
over 100% of the account value), then leveraged portfolios and unleveraged
portfolios may be included in the same composite. However, if the strategy
involves any discretion of when or how much to leverage (market timing,
for example), then the leverage becomes a separate and distinct strategy
and would require full separate reporting. In this case, performance must
be presented on a leveraged basis, with performance on an all-cash basis
presented as required supplemental information.</P>

is occasionally used in conjunction with verification services. Is this
term defined in the Standards? The Standards so not refer to &quot;marketing&quot;
composites. Portfolios must be grouped according to commons strategies
or objectives and included in one or more of the firm's composites. The
only portfolios to be excluded are non-discretionary, non-feepaying, or
portfolios below the minimum size criteria established by the manager.
(For a discussion of minimum size criteria see Performance Presentations
Standards 1993, page 6, V.A. 4.c.)</I></B></P>

<P>A verifier may agree that a firm satisfies Level I verification if all
of its discretionary, fee-paying portfolios are in a composite even if,
due to their unique nature, some are included in a single-portfolio-composites.
Level II verification requires detailed analysis of individual composites

offices or branches in differing locations (cities, states, regions and/or
countries) to construct its own composites based on its unique or specific
portfolios? </I></B></P>

<P>As stated in the 1993 PPS handbook on page 5 &quot;Each composite must
comprise portfolios or assets classes representing a similar strategy or
investment objective.&quot; In some organizations the location of the branch
or office may represent such a unique specific style, strategy or objective
that composites should be constructed based on location. In other organizations,
similar styles and investment guidelines are use in multiple locations.
Composites in such cases should include all similar portfolios. It is the
responsibility of the manager to construct composites in a meaningful,
representative manner. </P>

<P><A NAME="Eight"></A><B><I>8. A commissioned registrant (a person registered
or required to be registered under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
rules) is required under CFTC regulations to reflect that a new portfolio
is brought into an advisor's program or that a withdrawing portfolio leaves,
as part of a 6-column format. However, AIMR Standards state that &quot;New
portfolios must not be added to a composite until the start of the next
performance measurement period (month or quarter) after the portfolio comes
under management or according to reasonable and consistently applied manager
guidelines.&quot; Both AIMR's Standards and the CFTC require that performance
be computed according to the accrual method of accounting and the periodic
ROR be computed on a time-weighted, total rate of return. Would it be a
violation of the AIMR Standards which states that a new portfolio should
not be added to a composite until the start of the next performance measurement
period, if the Advisor includes a new portfolio in the &quot;additions&quot;
column of a CFTC require 6-column format table? </I></B></P>

<P>No. Compliance with the AIMR Performance Presentation Standards requires
adherence to applicable, state, federal, and local law. Also, the AIMR
Standards are directed primarily at achieving an accurate ROR for an Advisor's
composite. Therefore, so long as the RORs reported in a table are computed
according to AIMR Standards, inclusion of new or withdrawing portfolio
in the &quot;addition&quot; or &quot;withdrawals&quot; columns of a CFTC
required 6-column format would not be deemed to be a deviation from the
AIMR Standards.</P>

<P><A NAME="Nine"></A><B><I>9. Is there a minimum amount of firm assets
that can be excluded from composites under the minimum portfolio-size criteria?
</I></B></P>

<P>The minimum portfolio-size criteria allows managers to exclude large
numbers of portfolios that in aggregate represents a small percentage of
assets, An allowable percentage for exclusion has not been specified, but
the percentage should have a negligible impact of the asset-weighted average.
When reviewing the minimum portfolio-size criteria for present and past
compliance, managers should consider their firm's minimum portfolio size
criteria for accepting business appropriate to the period. Once a minimum
size is established , it must be applied consistently, and portfolios above
this limit must included. A manager cannot use composite results to market
to portfolios below that size limit.</P>

<P>Keep in mind that there are certain disclosures that must accompany
each composite's performance results. These disclosures must be made at
least on an annual basis for each composite. The manage must disclose the
number of portfolios, composite assets, and composite assets as a percentage
of firm assets. Firm assets mean ALL firm assets, i.e., discretionary and
non-discretionary assets as well as assets below the minimum size portfolio.
Therefore, prospective clients will have background information to help
them determine the representatives of a composite, and to highlight the
possible cherry-picking&quot; of results.</P>

be combined based on size to show results that are meaningful to certain
clients?</I></B></P>

<P>Composites are to be constructed on the basis of common strategies or
objectives. If portfolios above or below a certain size are managed differently,
size can be used as a singular criteria for constructing composites. If
strategies or objectives do not differ by size, a composite is to include
portfolios managed according to the common strategy or objective. A composite

Depending upon when the portfolio came under management, returns will vary
because of opportunities available at the time. Can a firm establish composites
based on the date a portfolio comes under firm management?</I></B></P>

<P>No.The composites should represent consistency - or lack of consistency
- of a strategy over time. Therefore, a composite based on inception date
would not show representative results of how their strategy performs over
time as market conditions change. New portfolios are added to a composite
at the start of the next full performance measurement period, or according
to reasonable consistency applied manager guidelines.</P>

client portfolios that are fully discretionary in the legal sense and yet
have client-imposed guidelines or restrictions that would make the portfolios
non-discretionary for purposes of including them in composites, what is
the recommended treatment? </I></B></P>

<P>If the manager determines that portfolios should not be included in
composite performance because of account specific constraints, the portfolios
would be considered non-discretionary for purposes of compliance with the
AIMR Standards. As supplemental information, the manager might choose to
group portfolios according to a general type of constraint. For example,
portfolios in which a significant portion of assets is invested in securities
which the manager is not free to trade might be grouped according to this
common constraint. Such portfolios might include inherited securities with
a low cost basis or of sentimental attachment to the client, founder's
stock, stock in closely-held businesses, or other such issues. The manager
might also chose to present statistics such as percentage of similarly
managed institutional assets or percentage of private client assets managed
according to similar strategies. Prospective clients thereby can gain insight
into the amount and type of restricted firm assets.</P>

what percentage of total account assets would make this account a non-discretionary
account? </I></B></P>

<P>The PPS allow the firm the ability to define discretionary versus non-discretionary
portfolio in light of the unique, situational aspects and services of the
particular firm. There is no universal definition of discretionary. However,
just as there is flexibility in creating composites according to a meaningful,
representative framework, the firm must also determine when including particular
or specific securities would have the effect of rendering a portfolio non-discretionary.
For example, a firm may decide to exclude a non-material portion of an
otherwise discretionary account for reasons normally attributed to defining
an entire portfolio non-discretionary, such as founders stocks, low cost
basis, sentimental attachment, prior trade approval or other restrictions.
Definition and policy must be consistently applied over all portfolios
and time periods.</P>

The report stated that the concept of composites does apply to fund-of-fund
managers who manage either pooled funds or separately managed accounts.
If a separately managed portfolio contains both investment partnerships
and direct private company placements, how should composites be constructed?</I></B></P>

<P>If a separately managed portfolio is invested in both partnership interests
and in direct privat company investments, it is recommended that both types
of investments by combined by vintage year. Each vintage year composite
will contain the cash flows and residual value associated with the partnership
investments, as well as the cash flows and carrying values associated with
the direct company investments.</P>

<P>A composite should include all portfolios that are managed according
to the same strategy. Differences in legal structure alone would not warrant
a separate composite definitions. However, it is up to the manager to decide
how results can be presented in the most meaningful way, and if differences

manager would split limited partnerships and separately managed accounts

portfolios that are fully discretionary in the investment sense, but which
have unique investment objectives requiring tailored strategies? Does the
AIMR recommend single-portfolio composites, or can the manager aggregate
dissimilar accounts into a catch-all or &quot;dustbin&quot; composite?
</I></B></P>

<P>The Standards require that all discretionary portfolios be included
in one or more appropriate composites defined according to strategy. An
aggregation of portfolios with unique investment characteristics into a
catch-all or dustbin composite will not provide meaningful average performance.
Because the intent of the standards it to account appropriately for all
portfolios, these unique portfolios must remain as single-portfolio composites.
However, a firm need not individually list the single- portfolio composites,
except upon request. An acceptable presentation would be to simply state
on the firm's list of composites the number of such unique portfolios,
the total assets represented by these portfolios, and the percentage of
firms assets. The manager must also include a brief description of the
strategies that typify these portfolios, such as &quot;global portfolios
managed to very specific benchmarks&quot;. The performance results of any
of the single-portfolio composites must be made available to prospective
clients.</P>

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><A NAME="One"></A><B><I>1. Our bank was very close to completing a lengthy
and expensive process of bringing all our tax-exempt assets into compliance
with the AIMR Standards as of January 1, 1993 and taxable assets into compliance
as of January 1, 1994. Just prior to completing these compliance requirement,
our bank acquired another entity whose assets are not in compliance. Is
there some sort of grace period that will be allowed after making such
an acquisition? Or, will we have to postpone making a claim of compliance
for the efforts we have already completed until the acquired assets are
also brought into compliance?</I></B></P>

<P>This situation represents three main areas of consideration:</P>

<P>1. The time frame for assimilating acquired assets into a framework
that can meet AIMR compliance requirements.</P>

<P>2. Systems problems, i.e., integrating accounts that may be evaluated
through different portfolio management, accounting and/or performance measurement
systems.</P>

<P>3. Recommended disclosures in the case of an acquisition. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Assimilating Assets</B></P>

<P>If the acquired accounts are to be transitioned into the investment
style and strategy of the acquiring firm, they should be treated as new
accounts and placed in a composite labeled &quot;acquisition of XYZ&quot;
until such time as the assets can be blended over time into compliance.
The acquiring firm will need to set reasonable and consistently applied
criteria that is well documented for determining when the acquired assets
complete the transition to the new style. Some accounts will be modified
more quickly than others. Therefore, rather than setting one arbitrary
time frame for bringing all acquired assets into existing composites that
meet compliance requirements, different portfolios can transition at different
times as long as the criteria are consistently followed. The historical
performance records for these strategies will be those of the acquiring
firm. Availability of the records of the acquired firm must be disclosed
and provided upon request, even though the strategies have been discontinued.
If the investment style and strategy of the acquiring firm is to be maintained
and its accounts represent separate composites, the assets of the acquired
firm must meet compliance requirements as of the first full reporting period
one year after the acquisition date, for a firm to claim compliance. In
other words, there will be a one-year grace period for bringing the acquired
assets into compliance if the strategies of the acquired assets are to
be maintained. </P>

<P>For example, if the assets are acquired in mid-July, the assets would
need to meet compliance requirements as of the beginning of the fourth
quarter of the following year. The historical performance records for these
strategies will be those of the acquired firm.</P>

<P>To claim compliance, taxable assets must meet compliance requirements
by at least January 1, 1994; tax-exempt assets must meet compliance requirements
by at least January 1, 1993. Prior periods to do not have to be in compliance,
as long as this is disclosed, with an explanation of how the past is not
in compliance. If an historical record, even an historical record that
does not meet compliance requirements, is not available because underlying
records were not maintained or because performance was not calculated,
this must be disclosed. For periods after January 1, 1993 for tax-exempt,
and January 1, 1994 for taxable assets, a lack of performance calculations
cannot be disclosed as a means of claming compliance. After these dates,
only the absence of underlying records can be used as a basis for not meeting
compliance requirements, and the absence of such records must be disclosed.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Systems Problems</B></P>

<P>The AIMR Implementation Committee has discussed the problems of integrating
different portfolio management, accounting and performance measurement
systems for different branches or subsidiaries or for different types of
assets or client groups. While recognizing the practical problems and costs
of integrating systems or of initiating performance measurements of portfolios,
the Committee has determined that compliance with the AIMR Standards require
investment in the necessary systems to evaluate portfolio performance.
Therefore, systems incompatibilities cannot be used as a reason for not
claiming compliance for all assets, i.e., a manager cannot make the claim
of compliance for only those assets that are measured and monitored on
compatible systems. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Disclosures</B></P>

<P>It is recommended, rather than required, that an acquiring firm disclose
when an acquisition is made, the amount of assets and the number of portfolios
involved. As the new assets are brought into compliance, prospective clients
will see an increase in the size of assets and number of portfolios through
the required composite disclosures. Therefore, full disclosure of acquisitions
is in the best interests of both the prospective client and the acquiring
firm. </P>

<P><A NAME="Two"></A><B><I>2. When an advisor buys a position in an existing
limited partnership, may the performance of that fund be presented as a
continuous record? What disclosures are required? </I></B></P>

<P>For reporting to current or prospective clients, the past performance
of a fund that has been bought out, i.e., purchased in the secondary market,
is not relevant. The new cost basis will be the actual purchase price on
the transaction date. Therefore, when an advisor or other investor buys
a position in an existing limited partnership, vintage year is based on
the year of the secondary purchase. If the performance of the initial fund
is presented as supplemental information, it may not be linked to the record
of the secondary purchase. The year of the secondary purchase must be disclosed.

<P><A NAME="Three"></A><B><I>3. How should a firm report assets managed
through currency overlay, asset allocation, and similar overlay strategies
for which the manager does not have investment discretion over the underlying
assets?</I></B></P>

<P>The mandatory disclosure by a firm of the percentage of total firm assets
represented by a composite refers to the percentage of total discretionary
and non discretionary assets managed by the firm. Total firm assets in
the AIMR Performance Presentation Standard does not refer to assets underlying
overly investment strategies such as currency overlay, options and future
overlays, securities lending programs, and asset allocation overlay strategies,
unless the firm actually manages the underlying assets. If the manager
has discretion over the underlying assets, they would be included in total
firm assets.</P>

<P>For example: If a firm manages $10 billion in equity assets (discretionary
and non-discretionary), $2 billion in currency overlay portfolios, and
$13 billion in asset allocation overlays, the percentage of firm assets
is based on $10 billion. If the manager maintains discretion over either
all or part of the underlying assets for the overlay strategies, these
underlying assets would be included in the $10 billion total. The manager
must also disclose separately the total assets managed in the currency
overlay and asset allocation strategies. When presenting composite performance
of the overlay strategies, the manager must disclose the composite's percentage
of assets managed according to that general overlay strategy (currency,
asset allocation, etc.) when reporting total firm assets. </P>

<P><A NAME="Four"></A><B><I>4. The AIMR Standards for real estate require
disclosure of &quot;Return formulas and accounting policies for items such
as capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.&quot;
What types of information must be disclosed? </I></B></P>

<P>The disclosure for capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing
commission must, at a minimum, indicate whether the costs are capitalized
or expensed. If costs are capitalized and amortized over some future period(s),
this additional information must be included.</P>

<P>It is acceptable for the required disclosure to appear in the entity's
financial statements (most likely in the Significant Accounting Policies
section), and to be incorporated by reference in the AIMR-related disclosures,
as long as prospective clients have been provided the full financial statements
within the last 12 months. In addition, for interim financial statements
where full footnote disclosures are not presented, the appropriate disclosures
(which would be included in the financial statements in he applicable Annual
Report) can be incorporated by reference as long as prospective clients
are provided the most recent annual financial statements. Incorporation
by reference (for) appropriate items) eliminates significant duplication
of disclosure.</P>

must also disclose composite assets as a percentage of taxable assets (discretionary

<P>The following sample working is provided for information only and not
intended to provide the reader with assurance of compliance. Past performance
is not indicative of future results. A complete list and description of
the firm's composites is available upon request. * Results are based on
all fully discretionary, fee-paying accounts under management, including
those accounts no longer with the firm. Actual returns will be reduced
by investment advisory fees and other expenses that may be incurred in
the management of the account. A fee schedule is available upon request.
* Our fee schedule is part of this presentation. Actual returns will be
reduced by investment advisory fees and other expenses that may be incurred
in the management of the account. A description of the firm's investment
management fees is provided in Part II of the ADV. This report has been
prepared and presented in accordance with the performance presentation
standards of the association for investment management and research. The
verification report of the independent accountant is part of this presentation.
The verification report of the independent accountant, level II, is part
of this presentation. The fixed income segment of one or more balanced
accounts is included in this composite. Cash has been allocated to the
asset class under AIMR guidelines. Only portfolios with market values greater
than $3 million are included. The minimum size requirement for portfolios
in this composite is $1.5 million. All accounts in this composite are tax-exempt
and greater than $5 million for all periods in which performance is shown.
The performance calculations are computed in accordance with the aimr performance
presentation standards. All figures include accruals, reinvestment of capital
gains, brokerage commissions, are time weighted, and utilize trade date
valuation. Custodial and investment advisor fees are excluded. The composite
was partially hedged against the dollar over the time period shown. Returns
shown are actual, hedged figures. The extent of leverage used is available
upon request. * Schedules reflecting the size and percentage of a portfolio
sector not included in the composite and the percentage of the composites
invested in countries or regions not included in the benchmark are available
upon request. * Information regarding the benchmark is available upon request.
* The normal characteristics of the transactions include purchase and sale
of forward currency contracts using a foreign exchange credit line(s) secured
by the underlying assets. The percentage of this composite invested in
countries or regions not included in the comparison benchmark is available
upon request. Composite returns are calculated net of withholding taxes
on dividends, interest and capital gains. The benchmark returns are shown
gross of withholding taxes. The stock segments of the balanced accounts
are included in this composite. The appropriate cash has been allocated
to all returns. A description is available upon request. * The above actual
returns are based on notional value of the underlying assets. Information
on the 50% hedged benchmark is available upon request. *Saying relevant
information is available upon request is not always adequate. This information
should be included in initial presentations and in annual presentations,
although it is not necessary to provide with quarterly updates. </P>

<P>According to normal legal requirements, an investment adviser must keep
files for the previous six years. This requirement refers to correspondence
and other business related documents. Please be aware that Rule 204-2(a)(16)
under the Act generally requires an investment adviser to keep all documents
(confirmations, statements, etc.) that are necessary to form the basis
for or demonstrate the calculation of the performance or rate of return
of any or all managed accounts that the advisor uses in advertisements
(current and historical performance results). Therefore, it would be necessary
to have the documents for each year that an advisor is showing performance
results, however many years that may be, and for all portfolios that are
included in the performance results.</P>

<P><A NAME="One"></A><B><I>1. Our firm wishes to combine the returns of
European equities and bonds from our EAFE-mandate portfolios. Is this permissible
under the AIMR Standards? </I></B></P>

<P>If a manager &quot;carves out&quot; a geographic segment from a portfolio
invested in international securities, the returns may not be presented
as an AIMR composite unless the sector has its own cash and currency management
(1993 AIMR PPS, Section X.B.1). This carve-out may be presented as supplemental
information, and additional disclosures are required. The manager must
list the composite(s) from which the carve-out is drawn, and must disclose
the percentage of each composite's assets represented by the carve-out.
The appropriateness of combining different types of asset classes by region
will be determined by the underlying strategy. </P>

<P>If the asset allocation at the carve-out level is driven by the asset
allocation guidelines at the total portfolio level, the carve-out of European
stocks and bonds will not be representative of an active asset allocation
decision between European stocks and bonds, and may not be presented as
such. For example, assume that a manager first determines the proportion
of assets to be invested in different asset classes. Within these overall
asset allocation guidelines, the manager may have chosen to underweight
European equities and overweight Japanese equities, and overweight European
bonds and underweight Japanese bonds. Until the overall allocation to equities
is changed, the proportion invested in European equities will be determined
by its relative attractiveness to equities of other regions, not by it
relative attractiveness to European fixed income investments.</P>

<P>If, however, the manager is given a specific amount of assets to be
invested in a particular region, and has discretion to allocate those assets
between stocks and bonds of that region, the carve-out returns would be
representative of an active allocation decision at the segment level. In
this case, the carve-out could be presented on a total return basis at
supplemental information with the required carve-out disclosures. It could
not be presented as an AIMR composite unless it had separate cash and currency
management.</P>

<P><A NAME="Two"></A><B><I>2. Can a firm claim that its international portfolios
are in compliance as of 1993 by fulfilling the domestic requirements? </I></B></P>

<P>If a manager has implemented all of the domestic requirements for non-U.S.
and non-Canadian portfolios as of January 1, 1993, the claim of compliance
can be made. When managers claim compliance for international assets and
clients as of January 1, 1994, the additional requirements and disclosures
will apply. </P>

<P><A NAME="Three"></A><B><I>3. AIMR's Performance Presentation Standards
Taxable Portfolios Subcommittee Report states that &quot;gross-of-tax performance
is currently recommended for the presentation of results to prospective
clients&quot;, yet Appendix C International Investments reads &quot;portfolio
returns should be calculated net of withholding taxes on dividends, interest
and capital gains.&quot; Please clarify.</I></B></P>

<P>The case for reporting international results net of withholding taxes
is based on the concept of reporting performance net of transaction costs.
Just as a manager's performance includes his ability to negotiate transaction
costs, internationally a manager's performance is based on his ability
to choose the countries in which to invest based on tax consequences. Basically,
a manager has control (to some degree) over transaction costs for his clients,
just as a manager has control over which countries are represented in a
portfolio. Country selection is part of the performance process and should
include analysis of tax treaties. Specific country tax impact should be
part of the performance process, just as security selection ( net of<BR>
transaction costs) is part of the process. </P>

Subcommittee change the compliance requirements for international portfolios?</I></B></P>

<P>International, as referenced in the Standards, means any non-U.S. or
non-Canadian assets or portfolios . As of January 1, 1994, compliance for
international portfolios means fulfillment of all the domestic requirements
and disclosures plus additional requirements and disclosures for international
portfolios. These additions affect the presentation of carve-outs, currency
overlay portfolios, and portfolios managed to specific benchmarks.</P>

<P><A NAME="Five"></A><B><I>5. When managing portfolios that include international
and/or real estate assets as part of a balanced portfolio approach are
the requirements and mandatory disclosures listed in the 1993 PPS handbook
necessary, or are these requirements and disclosures necessary only when
presenting portfolios consisting entirely of international or real estate
in an asset class specific composite? </I></B></P>

<P>The requirements and mandatory disclosures outlined in the 1993 Performance
Presentations Handbook for real estate and international portfolio are
intended for composites of those specific asset classes. Therefore, when
these assets classes are included in a balanced portfolio and composite,
it would not be necessary to provide specific disclosures for the net asset
classes unles in the manager's judgment it is necessary to do so for a
fair presentation.</P>

<P><A NAME="One"></A><B><I>1. For a firm to claim compliance, must current
clients be shown the performance of their funds on a year-by-year basis?</I></B></P>

<P>Current clients must be provided returns that are calculated according
to methods that conform to the standards and that are consistent with the
calculation methods applied to the manager's composites (e.g., a total,
time-weighted rate of return using accrual accounting for fixed-income)
and that covers time periods that are determined by the client to be relevant
and appropriate.</P>

<P><A NAME="Two"></A><B><I>2. How should the standard's rules on portability
of prior investment results be applied to the merged results of commingled
funds, i.e., when two commingled funds are merged into one, which results
should be presented as the historical record?</I></B></P>

<P>According to the full disclosure requirements of the standards, disclosure
must be made that the surviving fund is a combination of Fund X and Fund
Y. The manager must determine which is the Asurviving&quot; fund, i.e.,
which fund represents continuity in investment process. Portability of
the record as the historical record will depend on whether investment process,
investment objective, and staff remain the same. Continuity requirements
for linking the historical record to the ongoing record of the merged fund
are the same as for the general portability guidelines of the standards.
The record of the Anon-surviving&quot; fund must be made available upon
request. If the investment process is changed, or of the investment staff
changes, the historical records of each of the merged funds must be presented,
and cannot be linked to the ongoing record of the merged fund.</P>

<P><A NAME="Three"></A><B><I>3. How do the rules of portability apply to
the merger of two investment firms? Whose historical record should be presented?</I></B></P>

<P>When a firm is acquired by another, the historical is that of the acquiring
firm, i.e., the acquiring firm can show the performance results of the
acquired firm as supplemental information, but cannot claim that past record
as its own.</P>

<P><A NAME="Four"></A><B><I>4. If a firm is purchased for the purpose of
bringing on staff and resources to offer a product specific to the acquired
firm but new to the acquiring firm, can the acquiring firm show the past
performance record of the acquired firm as its own and still claim compliance?
</I></B></P>

<P>The rules of portability will apply, i.e., if all the investment decision
makers and substantially all the assets come with the acquired firm, and
if the staff and decision making process remain intact and independent,
the performance record of the acquired firm for that product can be shown
as the performance record of the acquiring firm and can be linked to on
going results. If, however , the staff of the two merged firms are combined,
and the decision making is shared, the performance record of the acquired
firm would be presented as supplemental information, and must not be linked
to ongoing results.</P>

<P><A NAME="Five"></A><B><I>5. When an advisor buys a position in an existing
limited partnership, may the performance of that fund be presented as a
continuous record? What disclosures are required? </I></B></P>

<P>For reporting to current or prospective clients, the past performance
of a fund that has been bought out, i.e., purchased in the secondary market,
is not relevant. The new cost basis will be the actual purchase price on
the transaction date. Therefore, when an advisor or other investor buys
a position in an existing limited partnership, vintage year is based on
the year of the secondary purchase. If the performance of the initial fund
is presented as supplemental information, it may not be linked to the record
of the secondary purchase. The year of the secondary purchase must be disclosed.</P>

<P><A NAME="Six"></A><B><I>6. A firm presents its quarterly performance
results of its composites in a newsletter format, or in another &quot;flash&quot;
type of report. How can the firm present its results in compliance within
the format of a quarterly update?</I></B></P>

<P>The Standards require presentation of performance at a minimum of annually.
As long as prospective clients have received past results in compliance
with the required disclosures within the past 12 months, the flash numbers
can be presented without quarterly disclosures, and a reference made that
full presentation in compliance with the Standards is available upon request.
If the prospective client is receiving investment results for the first
time, the required disclosures must be included in or must accompany a
flash report.</P>

<P><A NAME="Seven"></A><B><I>7. The Standards require performance presentation
for a ten-year period. Could you explain how this relates to retroactive
requirements (P.P.S. 1993, page 7, Section V.B. 2)?</I></B></P>

<P>A firm is not required to retroactively restate performance prior to
1993 to claim compliance as of 1993 and going forward. The reference to
a ten-year record means that as of 1993 a firm must build prospectively
at least a ten-year record that will be in compliance. For example, by
the year 2003, any fiurm in business in 1993 will have to present a ten-year
performance record to meet the claim of compliance. Firms dare encouraged
to retroactively comply for at least five years and, preferably, for their
entire history if possible. </P>

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><A NAME="Eight"></A><B><I>8. Can a manager show a performance record,
either in or out of compliance with the Standards, for only a certain portion
of its history? For example, is it acceptable for a firm that has been
in existence for 12 years to present performance only for those years that
are in compliance? </I></B></P>

<P>The standards state (PPS 1993, p 7): &quot;At least a 10-year record
(or the record since inception of the firm, if shorter) must be presented;
presentation of a 20-year record is recommended if the company has been
in existence for 20 years. The record prior to 1993 need not be restated
for a manager to claim compliance.&quot; If a firm has been in existence
prior to 1993 or 1994, the firm must report its past performance on a yearly
basis, at a minimum, for at least ten years or since the inception of the
firm if less than ten years whether or not the record has been restated
to meet compliance requirements. The Standards permit a firm to link the
performance record of periods that are in compliance with those that are
not in compliance as long as the periods are clearly identified as such
and the manager discloses why the past periods are not in compliance. If
documentation for past performance does not exist, the firm must make this
disclosure. Lack of records for periods prior to 1993 or 1994 means that
the performance record was either never kept or was lost or destroyed.
The full disclosure requirements of the standards clearly prohibit the
cherry-picking of favorable performance periods. </P>

<P>For example, a firm had been in existence since 1980, with both taxable
and tax-exempt assets under management. The firm calculated performance
and has records to substantiate such performance beginning in 1986. To
claim compliance with the standards, the firm must present its tax-exempt
assets in compliance at least since 1993; it must present its taxable assets
in compliance at least since 1994. It must also present annual performance
for at least 10 years back from the most recent annual performance presentation
date or since the firm's inception. The firm must disclose that it does
not have records to substantiate performance for any portion of the 10-year
period which includes years prior to 1986. Performance prior to 1993 for
tax -exempt and prior to 1994 to taxable assets does not have to be restated
as long as the firm discloses the periods for which it is in compliance
and discloses why the past periods do not meet compliance requirements.

<P><A NAME="Nine"></A><B><I>9. When requirements of the AIMR Standards
are changed or clarified, must the manager restate past results to make
sure that results are in compliance? </I></B></P>

<P>If a firm has chosen to bring results into compliance, it is obligated
to make sure the results meet current compliance requirements for all periods
for which the manager is claiming compliance. The main requirements of
the Standards, however, are not expected to undergo changes that would
cause revamping of performance presentations for firms that already meet
compliance requirements. Further, if major changes were made, firms in
compliance under existing standards, would not be expected to revise past
period information for the revisions. For example, if the standards someday
became daily time-weighted returns, presentations using monthly or quarterly
return would not have to be recalculated for past years.</P>
